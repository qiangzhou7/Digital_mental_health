"Hey everyone Iâm 23 years old and I suffer from severe depression. I dwell on the negative all the time and I canât get over the break up I had with a girl that was my best friend for 5 years. I would never want to with her again but I just canât help but feel remorseful for what I said to her when I broke up with her. It still haunts me everyday. She basically wrecked my life and Iâve been trying to rebuild it ever since. 
I have everything that you would think would make someone happy. I have a job that pays nearly 6 figures, my own apartment, my own dog, friends I see almost every day, I try to go to the gym 5 times a week but I simply feel empty inside. So far for the past 2 months all Iâve done is work, go to the gym, and then study for the LSAT. I have no idea what makes me happy anymore and I donât like to relax because it makes me god awfully guilty. I can barely eat and sleep. Iâve been a mess for a few months and I just needed to vent a little. ",4,"breakup, Need to vent "
"This is quite a lot, but I really hope at least one person will read through. This means the world to me.

He's a great person. He constantly puts others over himself and he treats me amazingly. This is the man I can see a future with, and he does too. But his depression and anxiety causes him to act in ways he didn't intend, and it affects the relationship negatively. For example, sometimes he doesn't seem enthusiastic to do many things, he has a negative attitude on just about everything, and loses motivation to do anything except stay home. He constantly has anxiety attacks, and often misses classes because it is so bad and he can't get out of bed. It's been like this since the beginning, and I've tried everything to support him. I stay with him through the attacks, I try to give him motivation to get out of bed, and I constantly shower him with love and appreciation.

It started to affect me as well. I started having panic attacks and feeling quite depressed all the time. It's caused me to break up with him about 2 months ago, as I decided that maybe this isn't in my best interest since it's been affecting me so negatively. I didn't want to constantly be brought down, and knew that I would have to deal with this for the rest of my life if I wanted to stay with him.

After a week of talking it out after the breakup, we decided to just take a 2 month break and work on ourselves and problems in our relationship. I had self image problems, wasn't very patient, and could be quite stubborn sometimes, and it certainly affected how I treated him and the problems in our relationship. Taking care of him also made me forget about self-care. I'm better than ever, have improved on myself, made friends and stopped being so reliant on him, and I feel ready to go back in with a more positive outlook on myself and the relationship. However, it is still very hard for him, and although I feel like I've improved and changed tremendously over the course of 2 months, he's still struggling to be more positive and achieve his goals (eat healthier, lose weight, etc). I don't want to be the only person who has reached a great place, only to find that he's still stuck in such a negative place.

He was on antidepressants, but they made it so much worse and made him suicidal. I've tried to get him to go to therapy, he says he hates therapists and that they don't help/make it worse. He's had bad experiences and I've tried to ask him if we could go together, if we could at least try once, but he won't budge. I've gifted him a self-help book about depression, I've tried to give him little advices about things he could do that have helped other people, but he gets very upset and tells me ""it doesn't work like that"" and doesn't want me to help. I've tried to do the things he wants to accomplish with him, such as asking him if we wants to go for a walk with me, or I'll ask if he wants to go workout with me. The only thing I can do now is let him handle it on his own (as that's what he's asked me to do), and although he at least now has hope for himself, he doesn't seem to want to do much or believe many things will help. He hates when I bring things up like ""science has shown that..."" and gets upset. How do I get him to at least try things?

I know that hidden underneath the mental health problems is an energetic and amazing person, as it shows through all the time. He's told me that when he was younger, he used to be extremely hyper and the complete opposite, but as he got older and his mental illness got worse, he started becoming more mellow and less enthusiastic about things.

There has to be something I'm missing to be able to communicate with him more effectively. I know that you can't love someone's depression away. I'm not asking how I can get rid of it, I just want advice on how I can help him take steps to help it at least. There's countless people who have found a way to cope with their depression, and I want him to be able to too. I know it won't happen right away, but I think with small steps it could be manageable.

Thank you so much.

tl;dr: My boyfriend's depression is ruining our relationship and causing many problems. I've been on a journey of self-improvement myself, and have learned a lot that I believe can help him. What can I do to help, and how can I get him to actually try to better himself when he doesn't want to do anything to help himself?",4,"breakup, Need to vent, share "

"I just couldn't stop myself from checking it all the time, from looking at my ex and his new girlfriend's profile pics. Even seeing people that I love and care about being happy made me compare my life to theirs and find myself wanting. That isn't right, I can't believe I've fallen so far I begrudge them their happiness. I need to get my head straight. It was tough. It's been over 10 years of my life recorded on that site. The good times mostly, some of the bad, and occasionally I posted something clever. But it's for the best. My life needs to be real. It needs to be where I am.

"I've been sitting here for close to an hour trying to write something because I have been told talking about this stuff helps, but I don't have anyone to go to so here I am.

I recently started grad school which, being honest, has been a great time. That's probably the scariest part. The fact that I can still be so happy at times and immediately crash in the same day. I moved quite a few states over so I am basically restarting my life which isn't too hard considering I really only had one friend and a girlfriend back home (let's called them S and A respectively), but the longer I've been here, the lonelier I got. Sure I've been making a new friend here or there, but it just feels like it's because we've all been forced to move here and deal with it.

I've been trying to talk to S and A whenever I feel down, but they're both starting med school so they're typically busy. That and I always feel awful asking people for help so usually I'll just pretend like I'm okay so really I only tell them about maybe 10% of what's going on.

Well A dumped me on Christmas (talk about cliche, eh?) so there goes that. I guess that explains why she's hardly been responding to me the past month or so. And I tried talking to S about how awful I felt and her response was essentially, ""You need to get more friends because it exhausting being the only one who can help you."" So after a couple weeks of building up the courage to finally talk to S about how depressed I am, she just tells me she can't help me because she's too busy. Her only advice was to ""stay positive because things will get better"" even though I literally can't think positively right now. Feelsgoodman.

This is where it gets really hard. Yes I could always turn to family, but I've never been open with my family and I just can't. I know it's what I should do, but it was physically painful opening up to my friend let alone my entire family. I just can't bring myself to ask them for help.

I've been having suicidal thoughts ever since I moved to my grad school but I just shrugged them off before as me just being melodramatic and having a dark sense of humor. Well now I can't shrug them off no matter what I do. I would comfort myself by repeating the reasons why I wouldn't kill myself. My girlfriend would be horrified. My family would be devastated. My colleagues would be upset. But now all these reasons just fade away and all I'm left with is ""my parents spent too much money on me to let it go to waste."" That's it. That's the only reason I won't actually kill myself.

I've been trying to motivate myself with the future, but that doesn't work. There's nothing I really want to do. No goals I have to achieve, no plans I want to make, no where I need to travel to. I just keep coming back to the money my parents invested in me. That's all I am right now. An investment.

Is it a shitty life? Yea, probably. I would love to enjoy my life, but all I can hope for now is to eventually be useful somehow and better our world.

I'm sorry if it was barely coherent. I lost my train of thought quite a few times. I think the total time it took me to write this was around 2 hours because I kept having to force myself to continue.

"Friends,

On a throwaway here for now. I had to write/speak to someone so I've decided here is the best place. 

With the New Year approaching, as well as getting back to normality and work after the Christmas break, I feel even more down and worried, particularly about my lack of resilience.

A bit of a background - about 4 months I moved with my partner pretty much half way around the world. It was a move we both definitely wanted and I have no regrets at all from that - however it's again where I think my resilience decided to leave me. I also need to travel weekly (only usually the first three days of each week, so two nights pretty much) for work - it was either that or they said 6 months of little to do within state... I think being bored 9-5 is even more depressing!

Now I'm desperately struggling to keep happy and I have this low to medium level of anxiety that just won't go away no matter how hard I try and think differently. I'm struggling with the flying (I'm already a little anxious but it now feels much worse), I struggle with being alone and away from my other half, I struggle a little with being away from home. The annoying thing is, 6 months ago, I wouldn't care less about being away from home! Or spending time alone!

How do I go about just getting my resilience back and being able to deal with things? I wish wish wish I could be like, oh, so I have to fly out on Monday, big deal, I'll be back soon, make the most of it!

I just want this anxiety to go away and leave me in peace!

Thanks for listening.",4,"moved with my partner,  half way around the world, medium level of anxiety, being bored 9-5 is even more depressing

"You know those times where absolutely everything is just falling apart that you can almost time it by your watch for when the next thing will blow up? Well, there was car issues, pipes froze in my house (because I was dumb), more stuff went and then yesterday I lost a friend because saying that I was lonely  and I mentioned she hasn't visited my new place yet = ""I want to fuck you big time"". We were in the same depression mental health group for 5 weeks together, so she should have understood what I was meant rather than this girl logic and then blocking me without appeal.

Anyways! That isn't the end of it. This one is a totally isolated case from the last but I lost ANOTHER friend. Back to back days. The house is falling down and it decides to drop the toilet on my head for good measure when it's crumbling around me (and it's filled with crap). Anyways! I'll give the quick version. We met on Tinder. Talked for 2 months, had sex a few times a month ago. She was busy with work for the last couple of weeks coming up on Xmas. I wished her a merry Christmas and she replied on the 25th. We talked about meeting up when she was back in town and she said she would let me know with a smiley emoticon.. Normal fare right? Not with passive aggression in play... We didn't chat these entire 5 days until she messaged me in the morning today... I was completely blown away by how fucking dumb this was. I'll just copy paste it...

""Hey XXXXXX, I've had some time to think and, I'll be honest, I don't think I want to see you again. The first time we met I told you that I'm an egalitarian, and so far you have somehow managed to be racist, sexist, homophobic, and xenophobic and I just can't see past that. Whatever this was was fun for a bit, but it was ruined for me by all the hateful shit you say. Maybe take some time and figure out why you see the world the way you do.""

Out of ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE. I looked back over my entire SMS history to find absolutely anything off key and I couldn't find a single thing. It gets even more stupid and this is how I knew I was dealing with a completely fucked person and it wasn't anything I did.

I replied to her ""I hope one day you develop a mental disease so I can come chop you down at your knees"" (referring to her cutting me apart over my severe depression altering how positively I see the world and hoping that what goes around comes aroubd) and this fucking nut responds to me ""a normal person wouldn't blah blah blah, you *albeist* fuck"". She COMPLETELY loses the plot and insinuates that I hate disabled people because I hoped that she got her just desserts with someone shitting on her when she's vulnerable like I am... Like.. I can't make this stuff up guys.. 

That's where the ball stops with me and I just let her have it. So much BS packed into this and continually tell her ""what is your deal, I don't get it"" and ""you know you're busting down a sweet guy for no reason right?""

This is an open and shut case. We have here a nut case. Rhyme time. She's one of those people that takes everything way too seriously and makes life a real misery for people that don't conform to her exact wording/lifestyle.

THIS was the most fucked up thing though.... We talked for 2 entire months and there was absolutely no scent of crazy fucker to be smelt. She snuck right up on me and suckerpunched me with this nonsense. This is a lesson that everyone should learn. People are really fucking awesome at faking being a nice person that's there for you and if you so happen to have higher stakes such as a child or a joint bank account with one of these sleeper cells, that is some really scary shit and it could hurt a lot of us..

Anyways, I'm just kind of numb to all of this bad news lately.. It hasn't really hurt me like a break up with a loved one would. But it makes me look inward and wonder if I'm a bad person? We only ever shared happy times and laughs and I tried to convey that I'm a sweet person (her car was vandalized and I was offering to come down and assist her and I only knew her for 2 weeks. Stuff like that) but then this almost conspiracy like fog comes back around me and fucks yet another relationship up. What does everyone think of this one?

(I have to add that this is a person whom conversed with me for many months and did me several times. She had no problem fucking a bigot because I'm not one and I don't think if anyone who had that big of a problem with those types of people, would have sex with someone like that. So I don't want people to think that I'm wearing Nazi hats, saying gas the Jews while I punch a woman in the face and spit on a minority... Not even close, you don't even know...)

"I'm trapped.

I have a job that I can't quit, because my family is reliant on the health benefits, and the income of course, and I'm in a field where I can't just simply find an upwardly mobile position. I also do a rather specific thing so my skill set is not easily translatable to other jobs - IOW I can't even make a lateral move. At this point, I can't go up, I cant go sideways, and the only way to go is down (which is possible because sometimes budget cuts have cut positions like mine - though uncommon, still a real possibility). Otherwise I could retire out of the position, but by then, the amount of retirement won't really be significant nor enough to live off.

I feel trapped.

This is going to sound horrible, but my spouse has become an anchor that's dragging me down. They have health issues, and my job's benefits cover those. But they also have a number of other problems. I don't want to blame my problems on someone else but here's the problem: I've come to the conclusion that people only change if they want to change. My spouse needs to change. But I can't make them do that. I can't ask or suggest it. If I do I'm met with resistance. My only option is to get away from them, or put up with their shit - which I've been doing for 20+ years. But here's the thing - we have children now and one exhibits most of the same behaviors my spouse does - and I've come to realize over the years that my spouse had a parent who also exhibited the same issues. Now though, our child is amplifying these issues - to the point where I see it as my spouse's fault that my child is this way. My spouse hasn't been diagnosed, but I'd say they are a hoarder. So is the child. My spouse refuses to listen to reason, or advice, or will not take any suggestions or recommendations - essentially is stubborn. So is the child. I could go on and on but the basic deal is that I could put up with it to some degree with the spouse, but now that the child is doing it too, it's too much to bear.

It may be my fault for being an ""enabler"" and letting them walk all over me - maybe I'm too weak, I don't know, but I don't feel it's right to force someone else to do something. But I also have given up on trying to convince them of the right thing to do.

It doesn't help that my spouse has become less and less interested in physical love over the years.

I think you have to have grounds for a divorce. I don't want to get a divorce - I don't want to be that person - I want it to work out - and it makes me feel like I'm giving up, and running away, which is not what I'm supposed to do. But again, I'm not strong enough to face this issue.

My spouse's issues have also put us in a financial mess. We're barely making it. So I couldn't' get a divorce if I wanted one, because I can't afford a lawyer.

And it seems like EVERYTHING is like that - I can't make more money without spending money I don't have to get a higher degree - which doesn't even guarantee a job. I can't get a divorce without spending money I don't have to do so. I can't afford a therapist because it's going to cost me money.

IOW, everything is a significant investment with no promise of any return on that investment - I'll only wind up deeper in the hole.

I'm not suicidal, and I don't want to make light of depression, but I am at the point where really, there's nothing to look forward to anymore. Sure, seeing the kids graduate, having grandkids would be cool, and so on. But it's like, the only way I'll ever get the house clean is if my spouse passes away and I can finally get rid of all of their trash. But what little income they do make will be gone (no life insurance) so the house we've fought so hard to keep will also be gone (becuase we had to refinance and now we'll be paying until we're 90, or dead). If I go, well, I guess it won't be my problem anymore.

So I'm trapped again.

Getting out of the marriage - well, even if I could, there'd be child support that I couldn't afford.

So it's either stay here and put up with and accept the blistering mediocrity that is my life, while things just continue to deteriorate and deteriorate, or just go away. Which is not really something I'm considering, so really, I'm trapped in a life of mediocrity in a downward spiral. My spouse won't change. My child will probably become even worse with age. I'm just going to get more and more distant.

I've considered having an affair - but you know what - I'm not the type of person others are attracted to - I don't have any money so the shallow people aren't attracted to me, and I'd have to pay for a service like an affair site - which I know most aren't really legit and even the somewhat legit ones aren't going to have people who are attracted to me becuase I'm the person they married, not the person they want to have a fling with. Plus, it costs money I don't have.

But you know, I'm not really interested in having an affair. At best it would just be something different to do. And I don't want to treat someone else like that. And I don't want to do that to my spouse. The only thing would be, it would at least be grounds for a divorce.

I mean, it's almost - almost mind you - and this would make a good movie plot maybe - it's almost like my spouse has engineered this entire scenario of getting me into a job and family situation where they keep me poor enough to not be able to get out, but just stable enough where they can lay in bed all day and read books, while not helping around the house or with the kids in any meaningful way, on the premise that while they might not be contributing to the finances this month, or for 6 months, in one month they may make a significant enough amount of money to bring us up to just barely behind and keep me trapped in this position.

Kind of like how America treats the majority of its citizens, but I digress. But yeah, the current national climate doesn't help with hope really.

My job does offer 4 free sessions with a therapist. But I see that turning into a money making scam for them ultimately - get you hooked and then...

And I can hear the advice now - that's not going to help.

Basically, my spouse needs to change and if they don't I need to get out. I know they're not going to change. I don't think it's right to give someone ultimatums - I think they need to come to the decision on their own. But it's pretty clear that's not going to happen. And at this point, I've done enough by myself without any support from my spouse I'm don't have the energy or strength to try to help them change, becuase they're not going to accept that there's even anything wrong with what they're doing. I believe it would take me leaving and being gone for them to finally realize it (which, because they have issues with depression, might set me up for guilt for the rest of my life...).

"I spend a week trying to organise plans, and everyone seems to go along with it. Then last night, two of them decide to go out clubbing and get wasted. They tell me they ""can't be fucked"" because they are hungover. I tell them it's all good but I'm still slightly annoyed they had to backpedal. Them leaving causes all my other friends to bail. 

Then 20 minutes ago I see both of them in my hometown one carrying a case of beer. I've texted them to no response. Ditched, again.

Fuck this. I feel like no one really wants to be friends with me for myself. Like all my so called friends take advantage of me. I'm the only one with a pool, so they come here and include me of course because they want to have access to it I assume.

This year was hell. I fucked up the end of high school, fucked up relationships with family and now I feel like I've got no friends. I've never been friends with a girl.

I feel worthless. I wish I could end it all but I'm too much of a pussy. Feeling like I just want to turn to drugs right now.",4,"Ditched again,no one really wants to be friends, friends take advantage, fucked up relationships with family, feel worthless, turn to drugs"
"I've slipped into a bout of depression. Ive also come to the conclusion that the xmas/new year period sucks.

Ive had a number of job changes and have moved between cities this year. Also had a gf but i dumped her after i caught her being intimate with someone else. 

I moved back home when i found out my mum has cancer. I got another job which i find stressful. I dont get paid a lot but i do my best. Leading up to xmas i was doing 60-70 hour weeks and fell sick due to burnout. Xmas sucked. I was bed ridden the whole day.

I went back to work for a couple of days after xmas with a rotten attitude. I felt undervalued and no longer motivated. And i felt so shit at my job and made some bad mistakes. 

I do my best to help my mum. Out of the blue one day my mum tells me that she is no longer proud of me. This hurt.

My best friend recently moved to the other side of the world.

I noticed recently that struggle to make friends and really dont want another gf. To compensate for this i became a workoholic.

There is more to this picture but i cant bothered explaining in further detail. The short version of this story is: im really fucking depressed. No motivation and beginning to think that i cant trust anyone and like everyone in my life thinks that they are better than me.

"Hello,

I don't know if other people experience this silly cycle, but I keep finding myself in my room kind of craving some kind of enjoyable social interaction but when it's offered to me I turn it down as I know I'll just be an awkward mess when I get there. So I stay in my room beating myself up at a great opportunity to feel like a normal human by going out and celebrating with old friends.

Some days I can do the whole talking to people thing, it's like I don't even have to try. The words just come out and I'd like to think that I can be kind of interesting sometimes, but about 90% of the time recently I just have nothing to say to people. I want people to laugh at my jokes and I want to create deep and meaningful relationships, but as my brain just won't let me communicate with people outside of just exchanging infomation and I become a robot with nothing to say. 

I just came back from my family house where I can truely feel like myself without being judged and everything is in good fun. I'm open with my brothers and my parents and socially it's a great environment But now that I'm back in my student house I remember how I felt before. I can't be as open, I can't express myself and I've built a relationship with people in this house pretending to be somone I'm not just because I want to have friends so I don't feel like a total loser. I have some good times with these people, but quite often I don't enjoy the current topic or dislike the humor as they've run it into the ground with how often they make the same references or just by talking about stuff I can't relate to in the slightest. It makes me feel that I should be liking this things and I'll be an outsider if I don't.

It's not like I can just go out and make new friends now anyway due to the problem noted second paragraph. The rest of my life is going well, I have a nice job, family is great and I'm starting to lose weight. But without great experiences with friends I feel like I'm still majorly missing out on what other people take for granted.

I've just been offered an opportunity to go and hang out with some friends a few miles away for New Years, but with my anxiety and my socal weirdness just wants me to stay at home. I hate myself for doing it, and it's not the first time I've turned these people down because I just basically don't feel like it, but I know that If I try to go I'll just be awkward and make the experience a bit weird for everyone else there.

tl;dr: I want to be a reasonably interesting person to do it, but my brain just won't let me most of the time and as a result I'm a bit of a social hermit. I want deep friendships and good times, but If I have no personality most of the time, how is that ever going to happen?

I've felt like this for around 4 or 5 years now, and it's getting to the point where I'm not able to enjoy the joy of a good relationship with another human. I've not made seriously good friend since college (uk) and I feel that If I could get this sorted I could feel happy again.

Sorry if this post is a bit everywhere. I have Dyspraxia and what might make sense in my head might not make sense in yours. I hope I've explained myself well enough. 

Happy New Year.

"Every day since we first met for the last 3 years K. has been on my mind. Where ""we clicked"" sounds cliche, sometimes its the only describeable phrase. We talked constantly. If there was free time in the day we wanted to spend time with one another until it was way past time for bed. I had dated only a few women before but with K. I could feel something special. We had a connection, a way of talking about anything that felt so genuine. So unique. Needless to say I loved K., more than I ever thought possible it was to love someone at all. I would to anything for her. I wanted to do **everything** for her. My life felt so complete now that I had someone to share it with, and that made me the happiest I'd ever been. This, surely, was love. Being so devoted to someone and having them feel the same about you. I'd been hurt before but K. made me feel like I could trust again. I felt we were strong together. Several times I would have to leave for weeks or months, and when coming back it felt like we just hit play after having been on pause. 


Every day since K. confessed to an affair she's been on my mind. I didnt think it was possible to hurt so terribly bad. The pain is my heart is physical, the agony is inside me. I never healed from the previous ex that had cheated and I have no hope to heal from this. So much time spent building something beautiful and within an instant it was abandonded. All I want to do is sleep but my dreams are about her. The moment I wake up I remember K. is no longer in my life and dread washes over me. All day long I feel sick. I've lost my appetite, nothing interests me anymore. After spending so long with someone they become a part of who you are and everything around you. Every object or event that happens in your life is related to that person. My life is on pause forever.

This new years will be a little different though. I'll be spending it thinking about a very special someone. Two years ago, I was attending community college. I had started in 2013, and told myself that I would bust my butt off and turn my life around. I wanted to make a change, and get out of the depressing rut I was in (as many of us here can probably relate). I remember coming across so many articles about depression, and basically came to the conclusion that the only way out was to fill my life with ""positive things"" and have some aspiration. And for 3 years straight, that's exactly what I did. I know this might not sound like a very big deal, since its just community college, but I did manage to Ace every class, always studying like their was no tomorrow, and remaining completely goal orientated. The dean herself actually sent me a letter congratulating me as being among the the top 3% in the entire school (its a fairly big campus). Even one of my professors suggested that I become a math tutor, and one year later that's exactly what I did. Not only did I now have a job and was doing well in school, but I was also well on my way to a top research university in my field of study. In my school, math tutors were assigned to the math lab, walk-in basis for free tutoring. One day a girl walked in and asked for some help with her homework. Naturally, I became completely head over heels for this girl. I don't want to bore you with the over-sentimental details, but I think I may be deeply in love with her. I can never stop thinking about her. It's gotten to the point where I honestly wish I had never transferred at all, just so I could talk with her over homework or something, anything. I miss her so much.

Wherever you are Gabby, I hope you're doing well and figure out what you want to do in life and become the best at it. I wish I could have brought you a bouquet of roses and tell you Happy Valentines. I love you so much and miss you everyday. I'll always love you.        ",4,"miss her so much, always love you"

Moving to my story. So, I met this friend through Youtube in 2012 since he was a portuguese gaming youtuber for adults (due to his language and way of talk) which I enjoyed a lot. 

I got the chance to start talking with him late 2015 and alongside a couple more viewers, old friends of him and his girlfriend, we were a group of 7 to 8 elements that throughout 2016 we usually hangout a lot on teamspeak (group voice chat) playing games and talking about life and stuff... 

It got very intimate my conversasions with him, told almost my whole life to him, about my sad past and he told me all his lifestrories too. Through 2016 it was all amazing... 

But mid 2017 our group started breaking apart, 2 of us stepped away (which i joined them later) 1 disappeared due to UNI stuff which I respect,  his girlfriend was left almost alone (which I will explain next), and him which joined a new group of paying-friends (which I will explain too) 

So, apparantly he was doing youtube only as a Hobbie and every cent he took from there in publicity was just a ""way to thank him"" for the amazing job he did. He had about 10k views per day on his videos but due to youtube polices he wasn't earning enough to make a living of that, but it was helping playing his bills. 

So he decided to move to twitch,  which is a live streaming platform focused for gamers. He was quite a success there and started making quite some cash on donations and monthly supporting subscriptions...

Later he started leaving our group and started talking more with the ones who were giving him the money (top donators)  instead of his friends who were never with him for the money...

He left us, we asked him why,  and his awenser was that US refused to join him, which was half true, because I personally didn't wanted to join and secondly he was the one leaving. 

I started noticing that his girlfriend was getting sad,  by posting sad songs over and over on her facebook, and I started asking if was something wrong, and she trusted me that the relationship wasn't going well (after 3 years together), he was spenting less and less time with here, starting with excuses to not visit her personally and stuff like that. 

During that time in october I got a bombshell, his girlfriend told me that he told her that met one of his female subscribers on twitch personaly and ""just"" kissed her,  cheating on my friend/his girlfriend...

I don't know why she forgived him, even after that he didn't changed his attitude,  he continues flirting every girl that pops on his stream...

I was the one supporting her through this rough time, trying to cheer her up in every chance I got, playing with her,  watching some videos and stuff... She was thankful to me, and I was like ""thats what real friends do right?"". 

But between me and him,  he just started to ignore me more and more,  he had time to play with his paying friends but to awenser a simple ""hello""  from me took weeks.

Like,  i'm not obcessed with him,  i'm just truely disaponted with him and his atittude... Swapping friends for money,  and leave his girlfriend suffering all the time... 

I exploded... I couldn't hold this anymore,  so,  I decided to let know every single paying supporter of his stream know,  to what type of person they are giving the money to...

How? Just with simple ""memes"" (images with text) comparing him to Dr. Disrespect (One of the biggest twitch streamers who admited publicly he cheated om his wife,  and had the balls to stoo streaming to solve his issues). I criticized my friend for only caring about the money and putting that over his girlfriend that loves him more then everything even after he cheated on her... 

What happened next was: He blocked me everywhere instead of asking me why I did such thing,  since he didn't did that,  I asume that I asume that I wasn't a friend for him anymore, and decided to run away and delete me from everywhere. 

The thing is now everyone knows what type of person he his, and let them know if someone with even more money comes,  they can be left behind. But since now my ex friend doesn't want to lose his funding (since he now lives from donations makong it a full time job). I don't want the other to happen what happened to me... 

Am I regreted of what I done? Nope! The only ""if""  point here was how his girlfriend reacted after I did this... I clearly see that she was sad,  and things could have been solved other way without exposing his life,  which I disagree, I exposed one thing about his life,  so the way she meant was the life as a whole,  which I didn't exposed

She is the only reason that this is upsetting me... I have 0 regrets on him,  but on her... I never wanted her to be sad at me because of this...  Never was my intention... 

This is my first post here... Just wanted to share my story,  if theres something you guys missunderstood due to my average english,  please comment below,  I really wanted to get this out of me...  If readed till the end... Thanks :)

"I have had problems with anxiety since my previous relationship, mainly related to relationship anxieties. 

I met my girlfriend in the summer holidays and we dated until we went to university. Whilst at uni we decided not to do long distance but ended up facetiming every evening for hours on end, and basically carried on dating. 

I was really excited to see her again over the Christmas holidays and then the anxiety kicked up again. I think the long distance had enabled me to not realise it was a relationship until I got home and it hit me and suddenly the fear of making the same mistakes I did in the past relationship hit me. 

I went to the doctors and was placed on anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medication and for the next week things were great again. But then the emotional numbness kicked in. I felt absolutely nothing for anyone or anything and it really got to me. Any feeling I did feel was just anxiety about the relationship. 

I want to get therapy about my relationship fears and I didn't feel like I couldn't do that whilst immersed in the fear, so I decided to break up with her so I could get help. I also stopped the anti-depressants because the numbness it made me feel caused me to self-harm which I've never done before. 

I'm so unbelievably sad. I love her, she's beautiful and kind and funny and I love spending time with her. I don't at all want to end it with her, yet I don't see how I could get help with the anxiety making everything feel like a mountain. 

I can't go back on it, I've hurt her too much by breaking up with her to say ""that pain was unnecessary because let's get back together"". And we agreed that if one of us broke up with the other then we wouldn't go back on it. 

I have this real hope that one day when I've addressed the fears I have that we can reconnect and try again but I know it's unfair on both of us to live with that expectation and hope. 

I have so many regrets and I hate mental illness more that anything. Im so sad that I can't be with her.",4,"long distance, relationship anxieties, emotional numbness, break up, self-harm, regrets"

"Iâve been a misanthrope all my life but it started with hope and now as everyday goes by, I lose every ounce of myself. I have been through a lot in my life so far, I lost my Dad who was my best friend only two months ago. He had a brain tumour operation which wasnât successful in 2015 and he was brain dead pretty much until Oct 2017 when he passed away from heart failure. He had been in hospital for a long time and since the end of 2015, Iâve lost who I am as a person. I not only have and went through panic disorder, anxiety (GAD) , severe depression and insomnia but also complete withdrawal. Anorexia was a hard one too, which i am still recovering from. I donât have friends (as a rule that I live by), because I donât trust human beings since Iâve been fucked over by so many of them in my life and the state of the world is a joke. I donât have anyone to turn to and every day, I think Iâm done. I am a postgrad student but Iâm lifeless as a person. Iâve lost passion for all the things I used to do, and the me I was is dead. She died the day my Dad fell ill, and the world I knew doesnât only no longer exist, but seems to never have existed in the first place. All the lies and the frustration makes me want to give up. This is pathetic and sad but, when I am not at university, I just eat and pretend like Iâm going to go out when I never do. Sometimes Iâll sit at a cafe and look like I have a lot going on, but the reality is I have nothing. Iâm lucky to be able to have academic prospects but Iâm only human and there needs to be a balance which in my life, there isnât. I donât care anymore and Iâve made an enemy of everyone I used to know. I look at people like disgusting aliens who I canât relate to and whenever Iâm out, I HAVE to be back at home. 

I havenât had a productive day in years, and it seems like Iâll never shake this feeling and my thoughts about the world. I really mean this : I HATE life, my life specifically. Nothing makes me happy like it used to. What amazes me are those people who can get a thrill out of a TV show, or a walk in the park or people with tons of plans and friends, or anyone who says âIâm busyâ. Iâm not jealous but then again, yes I am.

It said to strengthen ties with friends and that they can support or help you. But...why? How would it know that Iâm going through stuff? Idk...it just confused me. Maybe I should tell people about how I feel. Maybe I do need help. Iâve spent my life holding everything in. From tears to rages of anger. But now...I feel like Iâve hit a breaking point. Iâve felt like Iâve had hit points like this before but theyâre nothing compared to this. Iâm just really confused and I can think straight. I feel alone and scared of the world, scared of myself. I hate myself to the point where getting off the bus for school gives me so much anxiety I could start crying. I always feel judged, my friends are starting to fade. Maybe thatâs why I need to strengthen the ties with them, so I donât lose them. I just hope the year ahead can be better than the previous. I need my life back, I donât want to keep living like this. ",4,"feel alone, tears,rages of anger,hate myself"
"Perhaps I'm feeling maudlin because it's New Year's Eve, and this is the time we're supposed to look back over the previous year and try to make positive changes and take action to ensure the coming year is a better one. But I've been stuck in the same situation for so many years that I just can't bring myself to hope anymore for change, and right now I just feel worse than ever. I'll try to explain concisely, if I can. Apologies for the really long post, but I've held this in for a long time and I needed to get this off my chest.

I've known since forever that my parents haven't had the happiest of marriages. The biggest (and according to them, only) problem they have is my grandmother, my mom's mother-in-law. Now, I am given to understand that most in-laws don't have great relationships. With my mom and her MIL, things have been... horrible from the start. Her MIL (I don't like calling her my grandma, because she disowned me at birth and ignores and belittles me every chance she gets) has constantly tried to undermine her, badmouths her publicly (and in our society - Indian - reputation is everything), manipulates my dad by behaving like a sick, helpless woman in front of him (although she's the healthiest woman you could ever meet, otherwise) and claiming she's been on her deathbed for the last 25 years, makes caustic comments about my brother and I, and tries to provoke fights between my parents as often as she can in the hopes of breaking them up. These are incidents that I have seen occur myself, not things that my parents ever told me. They've avoided talking about this directly with me, perhaps fearing that they were forcing me to believe one of them over the other/influencing my beliefs in some fashion. But I could see these things happening, even if I wasn't old enough to quite understand them for a while.

My parents filed for divorce when I was a year old, but somehow they managed to reconcile, with the outcome being that my mom was forced to give up her job and her dreams of studying further to look after me because of course her MIL refused to.

Until my brother came along 8 years later, I remember things were pretty bad in the house; my dad wanted us to live together out of fear for his mother's health and not knowing what accusations or stories to believe, my mom hated the way she was being made to feel in the house and the way her actions were being lied about. Little incidents began being blown way out of proportion on both sides, there were some pretty huge fights. I lived with my mom's parents for a while (I love them, and have a deep bond with them). I wasn't a go-between for my parents, not then, but I knew I was still in the middle of their arguments. They wondered if the divorce would still have fallen through if I had not existed. But I knew they both loved me more than anything, and that was all that mattered.

And then my brother came along - a somewhat late miracle. He's nine years younger than I am, and with him came a move to another city where the four of us could finally live together by ourselves, and things seemed to be better - at least on the surface. Another move, and things seemed to be looking up, because my parents only really ever fought about was this woman. I finished school, started college, was somewhat reasonably happy that my parents weren't fighting as much anymore. My priority became to make sure my brother knew a loving home, where our parents didn't just love us with all their heart but also loved each other.

Then this year, my dad had to move back to the original city we're from, and I didn't want that to happen. But it did. And now we're back to square one, seemingly, except square one looks a lot scarier now that I'm no longer blind to every little thing that angers them. My mother's going through menopause at the moment, but she's more of a physical slave to her MIL's more and more obscure household demands than ever. She's depressed because she doesn't see how much longer this can continue, this life that she isn't living for herself. My father's unable to understand why we can't all just get along and be one big happy family, but then again he's at work all day, and when he's home his mother behaves differently. For her part, my mom's MIL doesn't want to live with us; she thinks she has enough money to live alone, even though she claims she's too sick to even move on most days. My brother, thankfully, doesn't care about this ridiculous and unnecessary soap opera drama. That leaves me.

My parents now confide in me when I beg them for an explanation as to why they look so distressed and harried all the time. They've never badmouthed each other to me, but I can see more clearly now how unhappy this marriage has actually been, and how afraid they both are that the next 20 years will be the same muddled mess the last 20 have been. 

I wish I hadn't asked for explanations, and I feel guilty that I wish I were even more removed from it all than I already am. I'm on campus in another city for half the year, but whenever I come home it's to a negative, toxic, depressed atmosphere that makes sure my determination to be positive goes down the drain. I feel angry and ready to snap, too, even though I have no reason to be. I feel guilty for leaving my parents in this situation for half the year, and for enjoying myself even a bit when I'm out because I know how sad they often are back home. I just want this to be over. I want a solution to this problem. I find myself wishing my grandma would hurry up and die, and there's a dark thought I didn't think I'd be voicing out loud but here we are. If people I love, like my other grandma and my aunt, can die before their time surely people I dislike can also disappear. I know it's wrong to feel this way, and I tell myself to buck up and be normal whenever I'm depressed enough about the situation to think this.

It's not so bad as I'm making it out to be. There have been plenty of good moments - in their marriage, and certainly us kids have never once doubted how united they are in doing their best for us. But I want it to be like that *all the time*. I want that happy family life. I don't want this sadness, and I certainly don't want to be the one aware of the massive failure in communication that occurs very often. And then I think I'm wrong for feeling that way. Basically, I'm a huge mess.

**TL;DR** My mom's MIL is a horrible person, nothing will ever change, my parents are stuck in a vicious cycle that is making them - and me - miserable, and I don't know how I can get myself out of this funk.",4,"Divorce, get this off my chest, distressed, unhappy this marriage has been, negative, toxic, depressed atmosphere, huge mess"
"I am M/16 and I suffer from depression. It all started when I was around 12-13 years old when I found out I was gay. 

I have friends that I can talk to but it just doesnt help me much.
In the last weeks my suicidal thoughts have increased by alot and anxiety and an uncomfortable feeling in my chest has increased too.
I just want to get comforted by someone (I would prefer my crush lol)

I dont want to sound desperate but is here anyone who can try to make me feel better?
My emotional pain has grown by alot recently and often times I just want to die but I cant kill myself because I dont want to hurt my close ones.

"Last year had been pretty rough for me. Mostly it's the crippling depression and anxiety I'm struggling with, there were ups and downs and I'm surviving. Though recently I've felt like there were a lot of good things happening in 2017, that 2017 was actually a pretty good year.

I decided to spend my night alone in my room because I need a rest from spending my nights with meaningless distractions. Basically just gonna have a nice sleep at 10pm after writing a resolution letter for my future self.

"My life feels like a sham. I am 23 years old working basically a dead end job that I have no desire to work in. My original plans were to use my undergraduate to get into professional school but I can't get into any of them so I am on the verge of giving up on those. I probably don't have any aspirations to be in the field I am in but with my parents pressuring me to go into this field, I felt as though I had no other option. I have no real hobbies other than playing mobile games, watching TV/Netflix/YouTube and eating.

I have a few friends but the relationships now feel surface level. I don't know if I could muster up the courage to tell them the extent of my depression. We have discussed bits and pieces of it, but never fully in depth. While the other friendships I have are mainly just hanging out playing video games, talking about music and getting high off weed, that's about it. I find no real joy in things anymore. The activities and things I do try, only remind me of how much of a fuck up I am because of my lack of life experience.

Growing up and currently I am an introvert. My family almost encouraged it becaus I feel as though they didn't know what else to do. I'm not sure how it all started if I'm being honest. It would be so bad that gatherings and social issues events where I didn't know people, I would pretend I was having nausea and hide in the washroom the whole time. Man, as I'm typing this, I'm just really ashamed at what I've become. Over the past few years I've tried to rectify these behaviors and I have seen improvements here and there (I don't hide in the bathroom anymore). However what I'm going to talk about next is probably one of the major reasons why I'm sad.

So in the 23 years of my life, I've never had a real relationship before. There have been moments I go to the club or try online dating where I flirt, but that's the extent of my romantic life. Introversion feeding into my depression has basically paralyzed my mind. Everytime I want to flirt, I switch into a different mode and act shy. At the same time, I try to avoid romance for reasons I've said previous. I'm very depressed with my life and what it's come down to. I don't like the job or the field that I've been planning to do all my life. I have no real hobbies or passions outside of sitting on my ass at home, nor have I developed any real skills. They say confidence is key when approaching women, but my self-esteem is shot to rock bottom and I can never find enough courage to bring myself to ask a girl on a date. On top of that, what happens when I do ask and she says yes, where do we go from there? 

I have family that is Christian but over the past few years I probably align myself as b in agnostic. Because of this, I don't really mesh well with my family and their friends since I'm thinking of completely different perspective. I still live my family and I love them so much, but I realize that this is not helping my situation. All I know is that it's going to take me a long time to save up and move out somewhere.

Speaking of moving out, I make terrible financial decisions. I spend money frivolously on entertainment and food. I also masturbate way too frequently which i know interferes with things such as my social and love life. I'm about 30 lbs over the ideal weight for my age and height but have no resolve or willpower to work out. I've had braces a few times and never ended up keeping the retainers so I still have crooked teeth. I feel like a fuck up every time I look into the mirror because of that. That is something I know I have to life with until I get the money to fix them myself.

That's the other thing about myself. If you haven't noticed by now, a lot of things I want to start or quit, I've never been able to. My will power and resolve is also rock bottom. I've tried working out, stopping masturbating, keeping straight teeth, you name it, I've never committed to anything. I don't know what is wrong with me, I can't keep myself going for more than a week befor relapsing before going back to old ways.

My family has started to notice how mad and sad ive become but have no real suggestions. My parents continually push me towards the field that I have no desire to pursue. I know they mean well, they want me to able to live well within my means. I also know things would be much different growing up in their shoes moving from India to make a better life for themselves and our family. But with that being said, my family doesn't understand how important mental health is for someone. My father treats my mother like absolute crap nowadays, but my mother is too worried about Indian cultures and traditions to do anything about it. My father has always cared about us but my mother has been a different story and I see it killing my mother inside. Again wee are Christian Indians and while it's not unheard of, it is certainly looked down upon. The sad thing is my mother would rather be in this marriage then to live out her days alone. That type of mentality devastates me and I could never possibly resonate with me. Hey it's easy for me to say never being in a relationship but I hope this behaviour isn't condoned regardless. So how could I possibly tell them the extent of my depression?

My life has been set up for me to live a nice and comfortable existence. However, ive managed to fuck that up every possible way down this long road. Ive never thought about seriously ending it all, but the thought has come up on multiple occasions. I know my family would be heartbroken if they were to find out something like that happened, so I guess there's one reason to live. Haven't considered therapy or drugs until now but I'm probably going to go once the new year begins. All I'm seeking now is a road to happiness somehow.",4,"father treats my mother like absolute crap, dead end job, life feels like a sham, terrible financial decisions, spend money frivolously on entertainment and food, no resolve, willpower, masturbate way too frequently"

"Hey guys,

So yes to spend 2018 off i am crying alone in my bedroom thinking where did it all go wrong and nearly attempting suicide.

Ive been building up my depression for over 15 years... pretty much starting when my parents broke up. I always use to have anxiety feeling that would make my gut whirl following with bad events taken place in 15mins... this resulting in a massive ammount avoiding bad incidents and essentially hiding from them. 

Coming to the present i feel like i am slowly getting to the point where friends are harder to come by and my current friends are slowly moving on with their own lives and leaving me behind (i feel like this due to not being invited anywhere or left to the last minute it makes me feel like a total loser when i have to ask someone what theyre doing) i also dont have the courage to find a soulmate purely due to knowing where to look or how to approach someone.

Anyways i want to know of anyone else success stories on tackling depression for the first time as i strongly beleive ive been stuck in this cloud for months. Hoping to seek advice from a professional.

My main wave of depression kicks in when i feel like my soul has a purpose it is pretty clear due to when stimulating my brain with something exciting that makes me feel like a have a purpose (this could be a simple as talking to someone) and the moments after said event finishing and the sense of importance to my existing fading.

Im sorry if this doesnt make sense but i got to the point where i nearly killed my self driving home though i told myself i think its time that i depended on someone for a chance and that i dont need to hold onto all the pain.

This world is tough no matter who we are... there is a few user online this NYE anyone reading please dont give up even though it may appear close friends and family dont care about you/me but sadly this is the true power of depression and in most cases causing the mind to be clouded. 

Life currently has taught me to respect everyone how you would like to be respected.",4,"parents broke up, attempting suicide, mind to be clouded"

"Okay, so here is the entire situation.

Growing up my 24M brother was bullied horribly by his peers and even at home my Dad was like your typical Asian dad and would be strict with him as he did not get good grades.

My dad would often say that he did not care if my brother had serious health issues so long as he got good grades and never gave him any freedom be it being up late or getting up a bit late in the morning.

Hence I became his only source of comfort and he used to talk to me and make me laugh.

Now with me, I had a pretty sociable personality and without blowing my trumpet can say that I was pretty and had excellent grades and because of this my dad was very lenient to me and gave me freedom.

Now my brother when he was 16 and I was 13 came to me with a weird request. He said he was already name called and did not want people taunting him that his little sister was ahead of him even at dating and hence wanted me to put off dating till we passed high school.

He said at that time that he knew his request was unreasonable but told me that since I was going to be pretty and would have guys asking me out and once I turned 18 or 19, he would help me out in my selection ( with my choice being a priority ) and would also in the meantime come out of his shell.

I flatly refused and said that I wanted to date a boy ( whom he had never even seen ) and experience HS life

That's it.

He stopped talking to me from that day and I never made that much of an effort.

After my first break up, I was asked out by the most popular by of HS who I later realized was the ringleader of the group of the gang that targeted my brother.

I promptly broke up with him and apologized to my brother who said that it further reinforced of his feelings of detest he had of me.

His says that ever since I started going out, his bullying increased even further and he felt that I had put my social life ar more than his comfort

He moved out when he turned 18 and could not make anything of his life,

He has since then been depressed, angry and had had trouble getting up in the morning and stay outside of the house for more than hour or two,

My dad cannot bear the humiliation that his own son is a bum started taunting him as a shameless loser and this made him get a part time job

He lives alone in a damp dingy apartment and my father and me pay him money per month and he also earns from part time job.

Now I THOUGHT once school life is over, He would help me out, talk to me and have the same relationship as before

BOY was I wrong.

He wants nothing to do with both me and my father, He says that bar financial help, he does not even want to look at me and feels that both me and my dad have screwed his life up.

He says that to me he admits he is being a bit unfair, but says that he always wished I had heeded to his request and maybe postponed of my dating life.

I thought after 4 years of non-contact time would have healed his wounds but boy he still cannot get over it. I could easily cut of his financial supply and have thought of this option so the he atleast can come live with me but did not go through with this.

HE SAYS he will never talk to me and forgive me and my dad even when we turn 50 and would not even COME TO MY DAD'S BURIAL if and when he passes away.

Says he regrets having a younger sis and wished for atleast an elder sis or a younger brother.

I do not know what to do as I was okay with cutting of for 4 years but cannot stay away for another year or 2. Do I cut him off financially and let him suffer ( atleast he would understand How I help him)

Also My dad too does not care and considers him a major failure",4,"SAYS he will never talk to me, forgive me and my dad even when we turn 50, not even COME TO MY DAD'S BURIAL, wished for at least an elder sis or a younger brother, dad too does not care,considers him a major failure"
"I don't want to die, I just don't feel almost anything, I don't know how to live.


I'm 25, never had a girlfriend, never had a real job, don't work at all since July and barely leave home.


I meet with only 3 people, but I'm really unsure if they consider me a friend. I feel like a placeholder, second choice, we don't really do anything, usually only eat and or watch TV. Except maybe for 1 who invited me to home new year's eve party but I got too anxious about meeting new people, so I cancelled.


In general I avoid meeting new people, I don't know what to talk about, I never can come up with a new topic, and especially I don't have anything interesting to say about myself. Those people that I meet with, they don't converse. They either don't talk at all, or talk and talk. Those are the only ""conversations"" that don't make me nervous, when I feel that I'm not obliged to say anything, but if I got anything to say I can say it.


I joined a gym but I don't enjoy working out, and even more I don't feel comfortable around so many people. Sometimes I'm freaking out because I'm not sure if should I shake hand with someone, or say something. When I'm resting between sets I almost try to hide and not draw anyone.


I feel intimidated by eye contact, especially with girls. Now this may sound super-stupid but recently a cute girl at the gym said ""Hi, how are you"" to me, and I replied with ""hello"" and walked away a little. In like two seconds she's in front of me, smiling, looking to my eyes and goes again with ""How are you"". Of course, I got completely frozen for long enough to make her walk away, probably thinking that I'm some weird deaf retard. The most pathetic part about it is that was the closest thing to a date I had in 2017.


I think it's a safe bet that my biggest issue is social anxiety. General anxiety would be second, and third for, I think, mild depression, mostly loss of joy?


Other than that I don't like how I look, partially maybe because of low self esteem and - very, highly, probably - inferiority complex.


I took antidepressants and anxiolytics (and hypnotics) for very long, now I don't take any ADs at all, anxiolytics in low doses and only if I really feel the need.

"So. This NYE i am at my neubghors who are just partying with friend and i am herebwith them. I am now drank 2 shots of Rum and thinking what have i done this year. I havent done anything, got phew new people what i know(i cant call them friends, never) 

My family isnt home, mom and dad are in diffirent country. I am here alone with my brother and grandmother. 

Soon..after 28 days are my birtyday. I am Aquarius. The silent sign. The intelectual sign..i am not smart..thats the problem, i am failing couple of classes in school. But i am socialy smart, i know which person is lying, i dislike people who overestimate themselves. So i lack self esteem basicaly.


I hope i can throw a patty for myself and see who truly deserves to be my friend. But there is 3 persons who i will 100% invite. My brother, my friend(he invited me to he's party and there i met a girl, who now is kinda my crush, and sure as hell ill invite her. I hope i get my money to throw it. Or ill make fun of myself. My mom doesnt realy care about me and i dont expect to get any money from her and now i have 0 euro and 0 cents. So i guess no party. Unless i get some money from grandmom, father(who i havent seen for a while, my mom and father are seperated) and mom. 

I'll have:

1.good birthday with small party or 

2.no party but it doesnt mean i wont have fun with myself and brother in home. Ill possibly buy bunch bottles with vodka and just drink. 

Btw i am lonely all of the time. It may sound wierd and it fucking sounds wierd. I imagine myself sometimes killing myself and imagining friend reactions. It's fuckrd up i know but that is what i do before sleep. Every night.

I have a bunch of family members who I only talk to when I see them, like on holidays. Those people, unfortunately, don't care about me. They care of me. I feel like there's a difference. I don't know if know if these are warbled depression thoughts, or if I'm just realizing this, but it seems to be the case. I know telling people about depression is usually overwhelming, but I can't help but feel so brushed off.

"I'm not really expecting sympathy as I know what I did was wrong.  Note, this is going to be long lol.

So basically I've been seeing this guy online for three months now and we instantly hit it off.  We were texting each other constantly everyday but little did he know that I was actually a catfish who posed as a pretty cute person who was just camera shy.  This was my first time catfishing and instantly after a day of doing it I deleted my account from the dating site but kept in contact with him without telling him who I was.  

Now, this ""relationship"" lasted through November and December which were both of our exam months which gave me the perfect excuse to why I couldn't meet him since we both live in the same area.  He was the perfect guy to me, we shared stories, our feelings, and talked about what we did on that day.  He was everything that I wanted to be; he was sporty, popular, and talented.  What made me fall for him though was that he was so supportive during my exams were he would actually take his time for a couple hours and tutor me.

Over time I just stopped sending him photos and he didn't care he thought I was just shy, but in reality my guilt was just building up.  I wanted to tell him badly but before I did I sought help on subreddits such as r/amiugly and others to get a sense of how I looked.  Obviously, this was a major mistake on my part and resulted in a major blow in my confidence levels.  I was a wreak, and still am.

I told him I was a catfish 3 days ago and to my surprise he took it really well and forgave me really well, he actually complimented me on how I was such a good catfish.  To my surprise he confessed that he also catfishes other people, but instead he catfishes people for fun.  This was going great.  **Until** he confessed that he had a boyfriend all a long and he was pretty promiscuous; but this thought never would have crossed my mind.  I showed him my real photos and he rated me a a 5.5/10.  I was completely average to him, I was ""not too bad"".  He wanted to remain friends and so I did. 

The consequences?  Honestly, I think I've been let off easier than most people but a part of me wishes he just totally broke ties with me.  This was my first relationship that felt meaningful with a person.  Looking at his pictures kills me inside and I haven't talked to him for 2 days now.  I feel empty and alone.  The nightly ritual that we once had of talking from 11 pm to 4 am was gone.  I don't know what to do; this catfishing scheme only resulted in many many insecurities.  I think I've fallen into depression; I feel lonely, jealous of his life, ugly, inadequate.  On top of this is other things like my joblessness.  I find myself comparing my life with his, he was everything I wanted to be.  I'm not sure if I should even still talk to him.  I find myself thinking about him every minute of my day.  I know I can never compete with his boyfriend, he is un reachable now.

This will be my first and last time catfishing.  I'm not sure if this is the effects of losing a friend, having my first ""breakup"", being called extremely average, or both.  Thanks for reading my rant if you're still here lol.  If you're the one I catfished, sorry again... I really wish to talk like we used to.  This is a horrible way to celebrate the new year... a part of me wishes that I had confessed after my Christmas break to remain happy just a little longer...

Ps.  For those who are confused, I'm a guy too.

**TL;DR** I catfished another guy, fell in love after he supported me for so long.  I confessed; found out he had a boyfriend all a long and that he thinks I'm average af.  I'm depressed now after my first breakup because I miss him and never can get him.",4,"totally broke ties with me, wanted to remain friends,had a boyfriend all a long, feel empty, alone, sense of how I looked ,was a wreak joblessness thinking about him every minute of my day, catfishing"

"Like most everyone in this subreddit I suffer from depression I've been dealing with since I was a child now well into my 30's. In spite of it have able been able to get things done like graduating from college even after loosing someone I loved. It was one of the hardest things that I've ever done. However, these past few years have been really pushing my limits. I won't go into details but things are bad and I need to be learning new skills on the side as my job may not be as secure (thought I don't even like it). That way at least if I do lose my job I can be working in a different field.

I can't seem to be able to muster enough focus/energy to even get started. There were only 2-3 things that helped me to deal with my depression (non drug related) but now I can't seem to get any enjoyment out of them anymore. I have always felt that since I've dealt with depression for such a long time I would always find a way to function. This no longer the case and I'm at a crucial time where that weight I feel on my back can't be interfering with what I have to do. So to those of you out there on the same crappy boat how do you maintain enough function to get thru the things you have to do? 

A little background on me: I have zero friends as the one or two I did have turned out weren't the people I thought they were. I take care of an elderly parent. I don't have the most stable life as I've had to move a lot. Thank you for any advice you might be able to provide. ",4," Loosing someone I loved, really pushing my limits, find a way to function"

"2017 

Started it jobless. Struggling with everything. I was becoming afraid to even leave my house. Fear and anxiety basically consumed me. 
Medications were basically ruining my life, even after switching, switching, switching. Every one I tried, gave me severe, unusual side effects. (let's stay off this topic, just this was my personal experience and rather not get into it)

Toxic home life, even though I got myself out of situations quick as could.. the new home would end up being toxic as well.
I went into debt trying to not be homeless. 
I disappeared a lot socially. Sleep a lot. Eat too little. Eat too much. That same old stuff.

But I kept going to therapy. Even if it took me several months to go back. Sorry I avoided you Sharon for almost a year, you are a wonderful therapist.
She told me not long ago, that she thought I didn't need therapy anymore.
I used to hate it. But I would go. I would end sessions by sitting in my car crying and trembling from letting myself be vulnerable. 

Slowly, it got better. Slowly, I got better. I'm still terrible at talking her advice, but we worked on a lot. I didn't want to end therapy, I said I still have lot more to work on. But looking back, I think she is right. I don't need it anymore, least for now. (though I do intend of doing check-up sessions here and there or when Im struggling lot more again)

I got a job at a nearby store that I loved and would frequent when I could. 
It changed my life working there. It's not anything special perhaps to most people, but I met the most wonderful coworkers and management that really, truly do care about you and try their best to work with you and your needs. 
I ended up being able to work a second job for seasonal, though they say they will probably keep me, and I didn't know how I was going to make it through the week working so much.
But I am glad I did. I'm able to live alone in a small rental mother-in-law home. I started to live here with a friend I had since 4th grade.
I know her true colors now, and after much fighting, she finally left and got all her stuff few days ago. Needless to say, I hope I never see her again. 

I'm on my own here now.

I got groceries for the first time in a long time on my own without any help.

I have a new bed to sleep in, no longer my old bed from childhood.

My bills for the month are paid for.

I'm doing well on paying my debt off, I'm keeping up. 

I have a great support group now. 

I actually have people I can truly call ""best friend"".

I have a cheerful, wonderful baby nephew that makes any day better.

I don't disappear months at a time now.


I want to cry from how relieved I am.

I think I can finally live not in fear anymore.

For the first time in my entire life at home, I woke up not wanting to hate myself

I woke up wanting to enjoy my day and it doesn't feel like I'm trying to just ""survive""

It's a weird feeling because I feel like I've been running all my life and Im so tired

I can relax and rest, I feel happy

"I've been on and off depression for my entire life, sometimes it can be triggered by a traumatic event, but in most cases it just happens.

I have friends, I have a good job, I have a roof over my head, and I have hobbies that make me happy.

However, I still go through episodes of just feeling completely alone, sad, and suicidal. I'm at the point where I've just accepted it and try to roll with it until it goes away for a few days and I can feel somewhat normal.

But unfortunately, none of my family or friends can really understand it. They get angry at me for being depressed or spending days locked in my room. I tell them that I can't control it, but they always say I'm just acting out. Like no, fuck off Debra why would anyone want to act like they're depressed?

"No native speaker, so sorry, if I made some mistakes.
So, I'm 16 right now. For few years my mental health was getting worse and worse. Always most people of my age were rejecting me when I tried to make friends with them, what made me really hateful person. Inside however I was disgusted by myself as I knew that only reason they are rejecting is fact that I'm somehow inferior to them.
It's not like everybody hated me, there were few people who proved to me, that they are my real friends, but I was spending most of my time alone. I was thinking a lot. World lost most of its colors to me. Everything was so senseless. I tried to do something with myself, for example I spend a lot of time working out, but nothing was working. I started cutting myself and I was thinking about killing myself more and more.
My whole life I think I've gathered around me 9 people who I was calling my ""friends"". Between them was this one girl, let's call her W. So about one year ago I've discovered that W is more important to me than other people. I tried spending more time with her and we grew close to each other.
One month ago I decided that if in three days nothing changes in my life I will kill myself. I knew no-one would cry about it, my parents for example never hid the fact, that they hate me.
In this time I had one really important conversation with W. Basically ther was one guy, let's call him J. She wanted him to be her boyfriend, but when he found out he started bullying her. He threw many insults at her, what really hurt. I should mention that she's from the broken family. She told me, that she doesn't have any will to live and she was planning to kill herself in the near future. I've said that day to her many things I've felt. I told her that she is most beautiful and inteligent I've ever met and J should be beaten to pulp for what he did. I think she felt better. Next day we were hanging out again and I asked her to be my girlfriend. She agreed.
We are together for a month now. Existence still was painful to me, but she was my reason to live. I knew without her I will commit suicide. I love her.
Few days ago I asked her if she wants to spend New Year's Eve together. She said that she will be partying with some girls, so she didn't want me around.
AND RIGHT FUCKING NOW I'M LOOKING AT PICTURES OF HER PARTYING WITH J. WHAT THE FUCK. WHY IS THIS HAPPENIG TO ME",4,"she didn't want me around,mental health was getting worse and worse,parents, they hate me spending most of my time alone, what made me really hateful person"
"I have extremely high standards when it comes to soulmates and partners, in fact, I've such high standards, me being 20 years old 
 I never had a girlfriend, and yes, I am extremely good with people; I can tell almost immediately who's who just by looking at them and conversing for a few minutes, and no, I'm not socially awkward, nor do I have social anxiety. A few days ago I saw perhaps the most perfect, and the absolute ideal soulmate in a video on youtube I've ever seen in my lifetime, and no she isn't super-famous or super-rich or anything, she's a starter youtuber. If you know a thing called ""internal checklist"" that you have for the perfect partner to fit under, appearances, personal traits, perhaps manners, the way they dress, their ""own world"" etc, not only was mine fully filled, it also has extras, AND she's single. Sadly, this isn't a story with a happy ending. She has a social anxiety, I've no way to get in touch with her, nor would I want to make her uncomfortable by being a random creep who follows her around, does research on emails /contact info etc, I'm not thinking about myself in this case because she purposefully hid her email address from youtube as well as contact info and I won't try to obtain it. I did try to look her up on facebook, and she hid everything from public, hence proving that it'll just make her even more uncomfortable if some random unknown freak sends her a random email to an address that shouldn't've been discoverable by public. This glass effect is SO bloody painful; I can see her, I hear her talk, yet she will never know about my existence, we will never meet, and never look at one another in real life, ever. It is new year's eve today, and I literally just feel like going back into my maths [I'm studying compsci] and not getting out of the world of mathematics for the next 3 months, I feel HORRIBLE, just so damn empty, tired, somewhat broken, especially when I realize that such people (for me I mean) probably will come up once every 20 years, judging by my past years. Obviously not suicidal, but my fucking god, I've never felt such a strong soul pain. I know it might sound cringy, and I'm sorry about that, I've just never felt this pain before. And if this is love at first sight, why in oblivion is it glorified so much? This pain is just so damn unbearable, especially knowing that I may, perhaps either end up being alone because such people are **ridiculously** rare, or marry someone just for financial stability, which most likely won't be the case for me; money means nothing if there are no feelings.

"My current situation is that I'm depressed, socially anxious and extremely lonely. 

I'm posting this in the hope dat Its something to talk about with someone. Maybe someone can pull me back to the ground. 

I've written thus pretty quickly so sorry for the typos in advance. 

Writing this story is actual the first one so I don't know what other perspectives there will be. But the first one will be the most realistic one. The one that's in my head and the one I'm currently living. No lies, no bullshit, no beautifying things. It's not a nice story, it's not a beautiful story. I hope it's written in a way you can follow, and I hope you enjoy it, I hope you can understand. And maybe this will never be seen by anyone other's eyes. 

The reason I'm writing this I because I want to get it out of me. For the first time I feel that I can actually change my thoughts. Maybe just maybe I can trust again. Maybe my thoughts of worthlessness and being the worst person can fade away. Maybe I need help. Maybe my dark and scaring thoughts can go away. Maybe someone will read this and can understand or maybe relate to this. Just maybe ... 
 

So let me take you back. Think of this boy 16 years old just moved, for the 3 time in 5 years. His mom was kind of his Idol. She was always there and she was able to keep me safe and protect me a little bit from my strict dad. 
Friends a had a few. I switched schools a few times so I didn't make a lot. Some were colleagues some work classmates. O and I mustn't forget, I had a girlfriend. She's my first girlfriend and she was a
2 year older then me. I don't think I really liked her that much, but for the first time someone liked me instead of falling for a girl that's way out of my league. So I stuck with her for a while. 

So almost immediately after we moved my parents started fighting. They did this before but not as much as they did now. The fights were different. They didn't had a subject, they were just fighting for the heck of it. My sisters, of which I have 2, didn't live with us anymore. They moved out and the youngest one only went back once every few weekends. They didn't notice it as much, but even they could tell something was wrong. 

After a few months my mom decided it was time to go to her parents, she would talk with them about my parents relation. On that moment I got back from work and my sister was back home as well. When we sat down, my dad's phone when off. He got a text from my mom, but it wasn't addressed to my dad. It said something as follows:

Hi dear, just talked to my parents, Hmm. Doesn't look that bright anymore. Probably won't take long any more, hmm. Miss you, love. 

This is all I remember off it and it's translated so it won't be 100% but you'll get the gist of it. And you'll also probably guess this wasn't supposed to go to my dad. It's was meant for someone else. My dad, sister and I all read the message, and could believe our eyes. What does this mean, what will happen now? 

At this point is was scared, no frightened. Frightened of the thought my parents would divorce. Frightened of the thought that I'm probably going to have to choose a side. Choose between the person you trusted with whole your life, but now seems can't be trusted and the person that was always strict. 
When my mom got back from her parents, she asked for my dad to come outside with her cause something went wrong and she had to explain her self. She told a very nice story. It's just how she and her colleagues texted with each other. For a second I wanted to believe that. I wanted it to be true,. But I knew it's probably not. This will be marked as the start of the divorce it thought to myself. 
My sister and I talked to her, she promised the didn't lie, that's she  old be trusted and she would never do such a thing. Yet again, I wanted to believe it so for then, I just accepted it, went upstairs and tried to sleep. 
Like I said this night would be marked as the start of the divorce, but it's also first thing I can recall what is damaging me I guess. After this night I can't remember a lot. It feels like my recordings have stopt for a few days / weeks. 
The next event I know, but I'm not totally sure where it fits in the time line, is coming downstairs on Sunday too see my sitting at the diner table, crying. Crying his heart out. Being broken by the months and months of arguing with my mom about nothing. He was devastated and didn't know what to do anymore. At that moment I didn't know what to do. I wanted to comfort him, but I didnt feel present at that moment. My sister was already up and she was talking to him. Trying to calm him down. 
Like I said I didn't k ow what to do. I wanted to hug him, but he always had seem to be arms length away from me. The thing I regret the most now about this, is that I was too scared of my own emotions to stay or to comfort my dad. I took my stuff and went to work. At work time stood still. It was comforting cause I  could clear my mind but also upsetting cause I wanted to go to my family. I wanted to know what was going on. I talked to my girlfriend who was working at the same place at the time. She didn't really help. She didn't have that much empathy and couldn't really listen to my story. When my shift ended I went home and that's the last I remember about it. 
At times I think the evening marked as the start was adjacent to the Sunday morning, but that just doesn't seems right. 

The last event before the divorce that I know is the most haze one. I only k ow a few things. I was up in my room, I wasn't alone. But I don't know if a friend was there or my girlfriend. My dad was at home. So it's probably a Saturday or Sunday. 
Suddenly my mom opens the door and tells me she packed a few things and is going away. I remember her asking me something. I don't know what. I belive it was either: do have anything to say go my? Or : would you care to join me? 
Either way I stayed in my room and that's the last I know of it. 
It turned out my dad had heard her over the phone, talking to a friend of hers, saying ""I know it's wrong, but when ever I hear his voice, it's like falling in love again"". This is when my dad said she should pack a back and go. 

Soon after this broke up with my girlfriend, the fact that I didn't really like her that much and I didn't fell that well and she could help me pushed me over the ledge to do it. 

So when my mom got out of the house she stayed a few weeks in her colleagues home. He didn't life there cause he just moved in with his girlfriend I believe, but I'm not sure. Our dad forced us a couple of times to get over there. Talk to to her, he always said ""don't forget, she's still your mother"". 
I found it extremely difficult, just talking to her, she broke my trust, She made my dad cry.  I didn't k know what for say but the fact that I was disappointed or even discussed by her mad when feel bad. And I wanted her to feel bad. I wanted her to feel the worst of us all. She'd deserved that. I deserved that, but she didn't. Or maybe she did but she never showed after that one night. 

Within a year she told us she had met someone else. When we asked of he was this person she meant to text during the first event. She promised us this is someone else. An old friend. It was my dad's best friend, at least I believe he was. They even had a certificate about it, and they both had it hanging in the hall way. 

After she promised, after we started to believe we found out he was that person all along. It also turned out that my mom talked and went to him even before the whole arguing started. Phone records showed everything she did and for how long it went on. Even showing this she held on to her lie. This is the hardest part of trusting someone, trust in someone is as strong as they are believable. my mom, not so much. 
After a while I found a girl, who was amazing. I thought she was beautiful. From the moment I first layed eyes on her I though, damn this is something else. 
And she was. It took me some time to persuade her. She first wanted to stay friends and such. The  she fooled around with someone else. That was the first time she hurt me actually. She lied about that. Maybe that was some kind of sign, maybe not. After that I tried again  and succeeded. She was officially my girlfriend and I've never felt better at that point. 
We did a lot together but not everything. So we had space to our self. She was needy though, but not too much. After being together for almost a year I decided to move. I wanted to stay in dorms close to my school, and so I died. At first the didn't like that. She wanted to keep me close. But I couldn't stand the traveling for 3-4 hours a day. Eventually the was OK with that. 
After half a year she went studying as well. She learned new people and I was very happy about it. She would get more grown up and that's what is was hoping for her. But, as she said afterwards, she got bored with me. But she didn't want to break up. I thought everything was still OK. When the next event happend. 
She wanted me to come with her to church for Christmas. You must understand, I've never been to a church before. At least not as a not tourism thing. So after a few I thought we'll off course, for her I will. 
So I went with her and her family. And I think it was one of the worst things I've been too. Like the priester would got on and on about how people should live more closely to the Bible. People didn't respect it as much. And I was sitting there, not even red a bible, not even a few words. 
Afterwards there was no thank you from her. She didn't look amused. So later that day after dinner I asked what was going on. We took a walk and then she said she wanted to break up. She didn't had explanation. She just wanted to be single. 
I was devastated, didn't see it coming. I was high up there and suddenly everything was pulled away underneath me. Most of you will probably know how it's feels to be dumped without knowing it was coming. 
I asked her if there was someone else. She promised there wasn't, but off course there was. There was this guy is her class I hadn't heard a lot about him, but I knew who he was. I found out because she was still logged in on my pc and saw all her recent chats. 
Again the trust in someone completely shattered. But I was still head over heels. So I kept trying. 4 months later we started dating again, but there was no trust. I doubted everything she would say I didnt believe a word she would say. 
Its hard to life like this. And I've seen some dark sides of my self that I hope never have to see again. This lasted almost a year then she wanted to go to her father in South Africa. And that's when I said we should break up. This isn't going to work. At this time it was mutual, but trust didn't restore. 

A year later I got a girlfriend again  it was fun at all, but I believe I wasn't in love with her. 

After a while my oldest sister would drop her contact what she had with our mom. She didn't want to hear anything about it anymore. To be honest, I don't know what the last straw was. I do remember her arguing in the car, and me waiting on the outside till she was done. 

My connection to my mother is nihil. Almost absent, she never apologized to me personally and never asks why I never call or something. It's like she's not bothered by the fact that she feel like an aunt or even a distant relative. When the divorce happened there was this big drama about money possession and such. 
My dad was crazy enough to pay for her motorcycle license. I don't know ow anymore why this happens, but it did. My mother didn't want to help my dad with keeping the household running. He was paying the mortgage on its own and even provided everything for me. He could barely come around. The hard part for me was that she didn't want the help my dad, knowing he was providing for me. That's how much I'm worth to my mother I guess. The though nothing more. This one stings, and is one that keeps on getting back. 

When I broke up with my second girlfriend one of my friends hurt me like damn hard. I was close to him, he was a very good friend of my. I losend a little bit. Did talk a bit about my parents, just barley. When his birthday came around he didn't invite me to come over or anything. Apparently was the brother of my ex more important he got to go, I had to hear from someone else. I'd expected that he'd atleast let me know, but nothing. After I asked he said that I would maybe had a hard time with it. Him not even asking was kinda a slap in my face and I left it at that. I'm not saying this is his fault but this adds up to the pile of things I can't seem to process. Now you might think this isnt that big of a deal, but only having 4 real friends, missing one is hard. 

And soon enough after graduating the other friends faded as well. The current count is 1 and I don't anyway how I can get that number up anymore. 

Work is the only positive in my life though. I'm good at it. Colleagues look up to me and it comes easy to me. There is also this one colleague. I was very close with her. Told here some dark thoughts. She seemed to listen, so at one point I tried. I tried to reach out but it didn't work. I told her I'm in a hole and can't get out. I told her the I don't see anything positive about even being here. She listened and listened. Afterwards she said  what about this other colleague? Can't you talk with him also? And didn't hear anything from her for a few weeks. Not even the question, jeez how are you doing? Are you as OK as that smile your putting on? This really hurts because I was kinda hoping we could have been friends. But all that I'm for her is a colleague, and never will be more. 
This time I reached out, it took so much energy. Months after it happened I 'woke up' again. Can't recall any that happened in that period. I know that I was done and decided I needed a change. 
I decided I'd go to China for a few weeks, went there, and life felt great. I was able to make friends. To myself I looked social again. For a few week my dark side could near me. 
I was sleeping in hostels and contact with people was so easy and fun to do. But this only lasted as long as my vacation lasted. Getting back was hard, after just a week I felt down again. Seeing her at work reminded me of everything I wanted but wasn't able to. The next month's are not recorded again. I was asleep. 

When I traveled to China I stopped in dubai. Here I met a girl. We met trough Tinder(I know right). But she is amazing. She always is there for me and really helped me out quite some times. The only bad thing, she isn't close. I can't just go to her, which in many many cases I wish I could. 

This not recording or sleeping is something is hard to explain. I don't know when I'm a sleep. I do know when I'm awake. When I'm awake if always feel like I want it to change. These are also the times I talk alot with the girl from dubai. I like to think she really understands me. She close enough I can open up, but lives far away, so I'm less scared she would breake my trust.

By now you might think, you had 4 friends 2 faded, one ended, where is this last friend in all of this. Why is he one of persons you talk to when you're awake, how comes he doesn't know. Well it's simple, for one he's to close. I don't need to show my trust if I don't let him see anything is wrong. Don't get me wrong, I'm greatfull he is my friend, but I don't want to put trust in something I'm not sure off. He has this believe that state of mind is fully controlled by your self, if you don't want to feel it you'll not feel it and there won't be it. Take sadness for example, if you don't want to feel sad you'll not be sad if you don't let it. Quite strong character you can say, but it also makes that he has less feel for empathy. He won't ask because he doesn't wants to seround himself with bad feelings. And I belive he would see a cry out for help for what it really is. Can't blame him, I would steer away as well if I knew what was coming I guess. 

So by now you'll probably think that this isn't this hard and they are just things I need to process or just let it be because I can't influence anything of it. Maybe you're right, but try to see through my perspective. I'm having a serious trust issue and I'm withholding my self of being social with any one new, so it's kinda hard to process it on my own. 

So I talked about the whole social part. This is one of the things om not anymore. I feel like since I graduated I can't converse with anyone new. I find it hard to come up with questions to ask. It's hard because it always feels I'm not interesting enough for the other person. Plus it always feels my common knowledge is going as far as the most of them. Maybe this varies per location, or group of persons. I don't feel like this with my best friend, I do feel like it when someone new gets introduced to me or with anyone at work. The only one who doesn't bring up that feeling is the colleague I've spoken off before. 

The only thing that is left behind are my thoughts. My thoughts and I have been locked up with each other for quite some time now. And they do collide every now and then. Sometimes my thoughts wants everything to stop. And not just the thinking but just everything. Feeling nothing, being nothing. And the only nothing I know, is something I don't want. I still believe that there is something to stay for. My thoughts just think otherwise.

"17 years old here.
Tl;dr: Have been ""clean"" of depression for about a year, depression came back, I write a list of things i want to achieve within the next 6 months, if I fail achieving all of the things I will commit suicide and give up forever.
Having had depressions since I was a child (always hated myself, was never satisfied with myself, even had suicidal thoughts at the age of 8, being sad and lazy, having no motivation for anything). Around 14 months ago I told myself I am gonna fight this, I will not let my life be controlled by this sickness. I completely started my life all over again. I fought my porn and alcohol addictions (I live in Germany, here it is no problem for people under 16 to have access to cheap alcohol). I got rid of toxic friends, started working out (a lot), changed my diet and got more social. I even got a bit into meditation. Focusing a lot more on important things like sports, school/education. I really got back on track and thought that I had beaten my depression completely.
After some time I finally felt true happiness. I found good friends with which i had a lot of fun and which i truely love. And it went on like this for actually a lot of time.
And then it all slowly crept up on me again...
I dont know why, I dont know when exactly...
About 2 months ago I started feeling inner changes. Doing things that usually would be extremely exciting to me did not bother me anyway, when I did them I did not feel any emotions at all (for example illegally climbing up a crane for the first time in my life; i did not feel fear while doing it or relief/happiness afterwards)
In general I just recognized some kind of neutrality towards life; i did not have any real emotions anymore. It became stronger with time. 
That is just how it started, a lot of events were since then (dont want to bother you with things that are not relevant/interesting, so i keep it short) like severe injury, finding a girlfriend, stress in general. And yesterday my whole life just flipped and the depression train got a full body hit on me. My girlfriend more or less broke up with me, my best friends hate me now and my family is mad.
I never thought that I would have depressions again but well there they are: crying, self hatred, suicidal thoughts, social isolation, energylessness, bed ridden, not having eaten or drunk water for 2 days, not having washed or changed clothes for 3 days.
Well after a lot of thinking I came to a conclusion:
I will write a list of things I want to achieve until first of July 2018 (exactly half a year). If i achieve all of these things, fine. If not, I will commit suicide. And I take this dead seriously - If I cannot get my life back on track I do not see any reason in living anymore. I could do it once but it only helped temporarily. So if I cant even do it again, my life will be bullshit forever and i dont want that.
Luckily I am fucking afraid of death (which is good because that way I have never tried suicide but only had a lot of thoughts about them) so I have a lot of motivation to actually achieve all the things on the list. I DO NOT FUCKING WANT TO DIE so I really have a very good motivation, but if I fail I will overcome my fear, because I MUST die, there is no other rational option.
If anybody is interested what some of the points on my list are (i havent worked it out completely yet):
-130kg bench press as 1RM
-250kg deadlift as 1 RM (yes I am very sports focused)
- having an average grade of 1.5 or better (which is extremely good in the german school system)
- losing my virginity
- earning 1000â¬ with side jobs

These are hard goals, but with enough work I can achieve them and I will start out extremely dedicated and set a symbol. For the first week of 2018, so the next 7 days, I will close away my smart phone, not have any social interactions, working ALL day (learning a lot, reading a lot, starting meditation, working out, cooking amazing meals)
The only thing that concerns me is that propably some of my friends will not be able to accept my new strict form of living (and propably be mad that I didnt talk to them for 7 days without warning them before) but I have no problem with making sacrifices like those to earn my right of surviving.",4,"My girlfriend more or less broke up with me, my best friends hate me now, my family is mad,  toxic friends,self hatred, social isolation, energylessness, bed ridden,"
"names where changed and the grammer problems are because of a reading problem i have but try to read it to your best abilities 



I was born from a 15 year old mom and a 20 something year old rapist dad yeah starting even before my birth shit was messed up, when I was born it was april 22 2002 in berlin vermont surprisingly it was cold in april snowing even. So lets move to one of my first memories one day when me and my mom lived in a trailer park someone slammed a door and a glass painting fell and it went through my foot. Later in my life me and a step brother of mine where fighting and I fell through a glass table causing glass to go through my skull causing more pain from an early age.
 So later in my life my mom began to date a man named dan he as a cook in south carolina so when we move there I had my first experience in a long line of male role models due to the fact that I had no dad growing up or a consultant father figure so I developed a distain towards them but not till the second one. So my mom had a bad case of ptsd and probably bipolar disorder cause she would change from happy to pissed on the matter of seconds and this would often be in many of my memories.
 After one big fight between mom and dan they broke up and I was sen to live with my grandma but she left me with someone else till I was 6 when after that mom and dan got back together and I moved to live with them in florida. We lived in an apartment building and me and dan began to develop a father son relationship he was nice to me and taught me how to read better and build with legos and was overall an awesome guy ( at least what I can remember) but all good things must come to an end around age 9 mom and  dan broke up and me and mom moved to vermont once again. 
During the time we are we moved back me and mom lived with friends and family for a short amount of time till we became homeless for a good amount of time during the winter. And it had a major effect on me academically and emotionally. I began to develop a reading disorder and Oppositional defiant disorder which caused me to not to develop any kinds of friendship and social ties only loneliness it got to a point where the other kids saw me a scary and unstable and the school thought it was a good idea to lock me in a small room alone with only a desk and a chair and a packet of work for 7 hours a day. I became isolated and depressed at 11 at 11 years old I began to think I was not deserving to live on this world. But something around this time changed in me the boy who once saw the world ash happy and okay had changed in to a semi sociathinc ball of emotions of sadness and anger to a point where life was bland and grey.
I felt alone completely and in honestly around this time my reading disability went away but my o.c.d went away but I still was depressed and sad.mom was busy but always made time to give me affection and strict guidelines and I wished I could feel the joy of my adolescence in these times but no it was nothing but dark.
 on day after a teacher yelled at me for my different actions in the school compared to the other children I decided to act the way they wanted me to be I smiled and laughed and spoked and behaved but it was just a mask I wore so the real me would die alone in his ball of emotions, but he didn't after a solid year of wearing a mask of happy I began to convince the other people around me that I had changed  and it worked I was let out of the room and made friends with the other kids, and it almost fooled me into thinking I was happy but no I could tell that no matter how I acted I can't hide how I felt inside. Later in my life I moved to ca with my mom and her new bf and he was a grade a asshole, he made me actually try to commit suicide and my mom finally found out when I decided to jump 3 stories of a balcony and she stopped me. But steve had done the one thing no other father figure had done he got my mom pregnant with my little sister bella and that is the one good thing he ever did in my eyes cause that baby was wonderful funny and overall an awesome addition to the family but all good things must come to an end.
Steve one night found a will I wrote cause I was scared he would hurt me and he locked me up in a padded room for 2 days and that cause my depression and loneliness to come back and fucked me over . when I got home he beat the shit out of me till I started to bleed from my skin, and with that my mom gave me a gift that I will never forget âdo you want to go live with your nana, or stay here with meâ and I love my mom I truly do because she is the one coinsastant thing in my life but I couldn't stay here with that jackass and I left so much out of the story because I don't have the time and the focus to recount the entire story but on that day I took 3 planes here and begun to live with my grandma. Do I regret it sometimes but overall I am happy and semi sad at times but I am okay here

A few minutes later 3 friends decided to come back because they were worried and didnât want me to spend New Yearâs Eve alone. I resisted in the beginning but they made theyâre decision and stayed with me. We had a small prayer and Christmas cookies and just spend some beautiful hours together.

"Hey everyone. Some context, I'm 16, sophomore, this all happened through my mid freshmen and mid sophomore year. I have pretty bad depression but got medication about maybe two months ago.

My once best friend lives over 7,000 miles away from me. She lives in South Africa while I live in the United States, specifically in central Texas. I met her on an app called ""talklife"" where you just vented about... life! I had made a post about how I hated myself, and I was in tears when one day she messaged me. She said she would be willing to be there for me and eventually our friendship really started to grow. She trusted me really quickly.

We mostly communicated on whatsapp. One day she randomly messaged me saying she hurt herself. It broke my heart. I wish I could have been there for her in person to hug her and be there for her. But I couldn't, but I did my best to comfort her. She opened up a lot on what she's been through. Bullying, parental abuse, and at one point a boy from her school pretty much threatened to rape her and nobody would take her seriously when she talked about it.

We both came to each other whenever we were hurt. I doubt she would ever admit it but she was a little clingy to me at one point, but I soon became waaay more clingy than she ever was. I was very attached to her. Being the closest friend I have ever had and the first person I would go to when I was hurting. 

I think my clingyness to her, along with my insecurity and depression, made things start to go downhill in our friendship. The first time we had a fight was when I was having an awful day at school and I was dying to vent to her. I was holding in tears at my classes and needed to talk but she was busy and constantly going offline. I felt like she was ignoring me and I told her ""fuck you"" and blocked her. It was weird, I felt better after that. I shouldn't have, because I potentially just ruined a friendship, but I felt better just being nasty, like it got my frustration and hurt out.

I unblocked her and apologized but she was hurting. However I recorded a video of myself just talking and apologizing, and admitting how I was a dick, and she really felt way happier after seeing it and seemed back in a good mood. I was glad she wasn't holding a grudge and felt better after the video I sent her.

It may sound weird to send her a video of myself, but I think net neutrality is not a thing in South Africa, so she has some bundle she says where she can use a couple apps but is unable to call at all. It took me a while to understand.

We had a lot of arguments along our friendship. A lot of times I questioned if it was getting toxic. However whenever we explained both our sides and admitted our faults, we were on good terms again. However, I still think it was taking a toll on our friendship.

There was a point where we got into an argument about something, I don't remember exactly all the details, but here's what I remember.

So we had planned to want to visit sometime. One day I watched a documentary on South Africa over it's gangs and crimes, and I jokingly told her I changed my mind over visiting. It was a dick move to joke about but I told her I didn't mean it, and that she should calm down. She started going off on me and I kind of ignored it. She later posted something on her status with her parents hugging her and it's caption said ""abuse."" I know it seems like a joke, but she has told me about how her mom hits her and has made her cry in fear, and how she's felt suicidal because of how her mom treated her, so I wasn't sure. I told her if she needed anyone I was hear and she told me ""Uhm... it was a joke."" I know that doesn't seem rude to say, but by her standards it really is. I was pretty insulted and I started kind of going off on her.

Eventually I tried to apologize but she wouldn't respond. I called her a disease and she told me she wished me a good life but couldn't take this and blocked me, ""for good."" I messaged her through my brother, messaging her school's name. She had a uniform on her Instagram she gave me where it said her school's name in big bold letters, I didn't stalk her or anything. She unblocked me and kind of panicked, but I told her how I found her school's name. I texted her it because I learned freaking her out gets her to message people back. I said let's try to fix things but she wasn't budging. I started getting mad and feeling very hurt. I felt like if she was a real friend she would try to fix things with me, and not cut me off, especially considering how close we were. When I look back on this know, I was pretty stupid for how mean I was to her, and not realizing she was just tired of all the arguing and me hurting her.

I told her some incredibly nasty things, bringing up a lot of the things she struggled with and vented to me about, only to have me use it against her and break her down. I could tell I was getting to her, really making her hurt. I was acting like a sadist over her ""being a fake friend"" which she wasn't. Simply tired of the arguments, my temper and emotional bullying. She soon blocked me later.

I wish I realised that my reaction was so stupid. In my mind I just viewed her as being a fake friend, and never meaning any of the times she was there for me since she wouldn't want to fix things with me.

The feeling of her being a fake friend really hurt me and made me kind of crazy. I cried a lot because I felt so betrayed. I borrowed my friend's phone's to text her things like ""you should kill yourself"" and ""you just lost the only friend you had."" Just really nasty things. At one point, I made an entire account on Instagram dedicated to making fun of her. I posted dumb edits of her face and made posts going into detail why I thought she was a piece of shit. I followed a ton of her peers and got up to like 700 followers at one point. I informed her about it and she started freaking out.

A couple weeks pass. One day, a friend of her's, who was also mine too, saw one of my posts and sent it to her to maybe make her realise some of the scummy things she has been doing. I made them sound a lot worse than they really were yet not quite making it a lie. She said she wasn't going to read it and was starting to get over what I had done. My friend reminded her of the times I was there for her, and how if I was hurting I obviously meant a lot to her, and him saying that made her unblock me and forgive me. I was very skeptical but we talked things out and I deleted the account even though I still felt like she was being fake to me.

I needed to get somethings off my chest and in a voice note I told her how she had hurt me before the account was made, and I was still having trouble if I wanted to be her friend or not. She then told me that she was sorry for the hurt she caused, but then she told me the hurt she felt from what I did.

She said every day she walked into school terrified that someone would bring up the account. She would hurt herself and contemplated suicide constantly while the account was up and while I sent her those disgusting messages. She tried to force herself to be strong but all it did was push her suicidal urges down for a short time. She cried while saying all this and said she was scared to be my friend again, because she didn't want me to hurt her like that again.

It hurt so much. I started crying and really felt like shit. I explained more of the hurt I felt but also gave a deeper apology and explained more on things that had contributed to me being an asshole. She then recorded a very long voice note, I think about 9 minutes, talking about how she was sorry for making me cry and the hurt she caused before, and how she forgave me, and how she was my glad to be my friend again.

That feeling I had when we fixed all that shit was truly amazing. I felt so much better. But I also felt a lot of guilt for what I had done to her, but I was glad we were friends again. I tried to be kinder and more patient and understanding with her. But honestly it didn't work. We had another big argument shortly.

She told me she was planning on trashing her phone. I was really hurt. It was the only way I had to contact her, as she couldn't mail me since her mom couldn't stand online friends. I told her I was feeling like shit because of her doing this, but she said it was because she truly believed she would be happier without her phone, and she wasn't doing it to trash me. That's not how I felt and when I got those messages I had to lock myself in the bathroom and cry. I felt so unimportant to her.

We argued about it for a while but I kept trying to keep in my frustration and hurt. Then randomly one day I snapped. All those feelings of her being a fake friend came back. I told her I was so fucking done with her and if she ever messaged me again I would reactivate the account, and that she should go die in a hole.

A couple days later I apologized but asked her to still not contact me, and eventually after about two weeks I asked to talk to her. She said all the suicidal feelings came back and she went back to her habit of harming herself and crying to sleep. She kept saying things like ""go ahead, tell me I should die"" when I was apologizing and she eventually threatened to kill herself. I contacted her mom through one of her friends and told her to make sure she was okay. I know she was abusive but I know she wouldn't let her kill herself. She was okay, but she also told her all the things I did to her, which resulted in her mom telling me to kill myself and threatened me with a court case and tracking me down if she had to. Honestly wasn't worried about her threats at all, and even if I did get in trouble, well I deserved it.

So yeah, I am sorry this was so damn long. I just wanted this entire situation off my chest. I feel so guilty for how I hurt her and constantly cry at night because of it, and I miss her so much. I wish I wasn't such an asshole. I have never treated anybody so poorly in my life yet she's the closest friend I have ever had. I'm usually extra nice to girls and I was always there for her when she was hurting or needed anyone but sometimes my emotions would go crazy and my mind would get truly fucked up. A lot of it has to do with us being only online friends. I really don't treat any of my friends in real life like that.

I really wish she would listen to me apologize and kind of explain why I was hurt, and allow me to make it up to her by maybe like mailing her a gift. I miss her. I genuinely hope she's okay. I don't want to believe I'm an awful person because I do care about her, and so many other people in my life, but sometimes I'm just a terrible person with the way I explode. I don't know if I should forgive myself, I feel like I deserve to hate myself and have everyone around me hate me.

*TL;DR I emotionally tormented my best friend because I was so insecure and vengeful for times she really hurt me, even though it usually wasn't her fault, and it resulted in so much harm towards her. I feel like I deserve so much worse because of what I did.*

I'm sorry if this doesn't seem like the best sunreddit to post this, but it does deal with two people who suffer from it and causes a lot of pain in their life even though the mail focus has been on the relationship. This sunreddit also seems the most supportive from others I have tried.

"Last night, I ended a relationship I had with someone that I'm very, very in love with. We can't be together now or anytime in the near future because of distance, and that was becoming unbearable. I started talking to another guy, someone I don't really know at all, and this is how I ruined what I had with the guy I love and I just miss him so much. I can't even talk to him anymore even though I desperately want to. I feel awful about hurting him and talking to him will make it worse no matter how much I wish I could.

I had a ""break up"" with a very close friend recently as well, someone who I share years worth of memories with and used to hang out with weekly. She posted a picture on her instagram story two days ago of her at a specific theme park (plans we had together) with someone else, and then yesterday she posted a picture of her with some new friends captioned ""best gifts of 2017"". My other friends think she is trying to make me jealous.

I live with my parents and my dad has been treating me like shit, today I literally thought he was going to kill me over an unwashed dish. I'm just tired of the abuse, I've gotten enough from him and my mom's ex bf combined. I don't understand what I did to deserve any of that but I guess it will always be beyond me.

On top of all this, I'm becoming very unmotivated in college and life in general, I'm afraid of not being successful in what I truly am passionate about, and I have no job (I quit because of anxiety) and need a new one soon because I'm going to run out of money. 

I feel like shit and like a terrible person, I can hardly eat and I've basically just been crying all day. I have no NYE plans (obviously) and I just hate my life so much. The guy I met recently wants to go out for coffee this upcoming week, and I agreed even though I feel hesitant. I'm just having trouble accepting that I can't physically be with the guy I love. I feel awful for what I've done.

tl;dr, I'm depressed and crying on NYE, almost everything in my life is currently shitty, I ruined something special I had with the person I love and wanted to be with more than anything and ultimately broke his heart

"I'm just gonna leave it here so I can come back to it later. If you look for help this won't help you, after all I can't help anyone.

I see no solution to this problem. It's not like I can't feel anything, that's not it. It's more like every emotion I feel is flat and fake. I can be happy but it is an empty happiness. I can be sad but it doesn't last long before I force myself to feel happy again. I can control it. I can control my happiness. I force myself to laugh and have fun and I feel the dopamine rush.

Deep down, however, I feel like in the long run it doesn't mean anything. I don't know what the goal of life is but it's not to be happy. Not for me at least.

I would love to feel empathy again. I miss it. No matter how hard I try, I can't feel it. It's like I have become immune to it.

I have one male friend who knows everything about me. I believe I'm not homosexual but I think about him a lot recently. It feels like he is someone who I would be able to feel affection towards. Even this would be better than nothing, I suppose. I don't know what to think about all of this, I hope I'm not losing my mind.",4,"emotion I feel is flat and fake, not homosexual but I think about him a lot recently"
"I'm going through a pretty rough breakup right now, and... I have no one, anymore. I have no one in my life now that I have lost my dove. And it's entirely my fault that I lost her. I fucked up, and now there's nothing left.

I have no idea why I'm doing this. I guess, I just wanted people to see. See some of my conversations with a therapist on trying to improve myself, and... my failing to do so. Just so I can show people that... I tried. This is the first conversation between my therapist and I, about three months ago. I guess you should know I'm pretty straightforward usually and... I'm also pretty fucked up. I was trying to become a better man, for myself... but mostly for her.


I don't know if this will actually interest anyone, but... Well, maybe someone will be kind enough to grant me some company or companionship right now... I am in a very, very dark place and... I would rather have died than to have lost that girl, even... even if we weren't really happy together. I took out the names because... well, the girl in question knows about my therapist, as it was her suggestion and all and.. Despite the fact she will never see this, I still don't want it to be recognized if she does.


 *Hello, &lt;//////&gt;. My name is &lt;/////&gt;. I guess I don't know where to start. Right now, the particular issue I'm having is that my insecurity has been the cause of every relationship I've had failing, and is ruining my current relationship. I have no idea how to stop it. I'm too needy, too clingy, unable to control my emotions at all. I am obsessive, and possessive. I am a hateful, spiteful, angry person and I have no idea how to let go of the things that have happened in the past. I want to change, but all anyone ever says is ""only you can do that"" and ""only you know how"" and that doesn't help. If it's all up to me, then it's hopeless.*


&gt; Hi ///// - Thanks you so much for reaching out and sharing so information about your experiences. My name is ////// ////// and I am a licensed therapist. Reaching out for help takes courage /////, you have made a wonderful first step toward creating the life you have always wanted. You talked about being really sensitive right now and how the way that you are feeling and responding to others is causing a great deal of distress. Based on the things you have shared, what you are feeling makes perfect sense. I have experience working with individuals who are interested in working through the barriers and unresolved issues in life to find a higher level of peace and joy. I would like the opportunity to help you this this time in your life. I would like for you to review my online schedule and select a day and time for us to have a live video session. This session would enable me to share the limits of confidentiality, review consent for therapy, explain what you can expect throughout the therapeutic process and answer any question you may have. Be encouraged, I think therapy might be a chance for a new beginning for you!! In the meantime, can you share more about how you have been dealing with all of the things you are experiencing? Who supports you in times like these?


*I have very few people that I have kept around me. I have no network of real friends, I have no support group. The majority of my emotional stability becomes the responsibility of the person I am romantically involved in, and this causes a great deal of stress to the both of us, and is generally an unhealthy way of handling things. I have only one or two true companions in my life, my closest and oldest of which I no longer get to see because he has moved far away and only visits rarely. Any occasional acquaintances I happen to make almost always end quickly, or never develope beyond anything other than a work mate or occasional social interaction. My family has either moved states away, or has so much drama and conflict that I do not feel it would be beneficial to bring them into my own.*

 *There are many worse things, though, that I feel probably ought to be brought to attention sooner or later. There have been many traumatic events I have experienced from childhood to adulthood that have left me a very isolated person. Even when there are people who try to reach out to me, I do not trust them with knowing most things, and do not want to burden them with my emotional issues. I am not an open person. I also have been diagnosed with ADHD and Insomnia, and the last psychiatrist I saw I didn't spend enough time with to confirm but it is also suspected that I have manic depressive bi-polar disorder or another emotional instability illness based on the time I spent with them and the fact that most of my family has been diagnosed with MDBPD.*

 *As for how I've been dealing with it, I've tried many things over the years, most of which weren't beneficial. Drug and alcohol abuse was severe during particular periods of time. I cannot maintain hobbies or interests for any period of time that could be considered significant. Mostly I just lay in bed, being miserable. I do not have the energy, the focus, or the motivation to do anything. I never have.*

*Many people have told me to seek therapy in the past, but the only time I was ever actually involved in psychiatric evaluation was when I was around 17 or 18, still in high school. At least, that's the only ""adulthood"" memory I can account for. When I was younger, my brothers and I were all involved in group therapy because we had all been sexually assaulted repeatedly by the son of a family friend. I was too young to remember those sessions, though, and the molestation didn't actually end for years following, nor was that the only individual to do so.*

"This year especially. I joined a D&amp;D group this year trying to make friends but they all don't like me or idk because none of them want to be friends. Anyways, they've been texting each other in our group chat (which we have when we need to ask questions like find out if everyone is good to play on our set days) for the past few days about having a New Years party. Everyone but one person said they'd be up for it (the one person was busy)...but they never asked me. They asked everyone else. Never mentioned me, asked how I was, if I could make it, if I wanted to come...nothing.

Party is tonight. Early this morning (like 1-2 am), I get a text from the DM asking about my back (I threw it out a while ago and have been in constant pain), I was thinking ""oh ok this is where he asks if I'm coming.""...yeah no. Just asked about my back, I said it was slightly better since I've been resting and he said something like ""Oh that's good.""...that's it.

And still no one asking about me in the main chat.

It hurts being excluded like that. I can only assume they did it because I don't drive, thus I can't really get to said party or get back home without someone else driving me...but they could at least offer or ask why I've been quiet or anything! It's the thought that counts...just them thinking about me would have made it easier.

"Iâd like to preface this post by saying if it appears that I am trolling, I am not, but I realise some of these points may seem illegitimate. 

I watched frozen for the first time recently. Being a 20 year old man, I realised I wasnât in the target audience for it, but I watched it nonetheless as I had nothin better to do. As I watched it I found myself strangely entranced. I enjoyed this innocence of it but it was strangely alien to me, like Iâd never experienced something like it before. It got me thinking about my childhood, which Iâve not long departed, and yet have rarely reflected upon.

I thought about how alien frozen was to me, and how I lacked anything like it when I was growing up. I was never shown Disney or Pixar films in my infancy, unlike, dare I say, most people my age. I summed this up to spending very little time with my mother due to her illnesses that rendered her incapable of caring for me in my formative years. Instead, I spent them in the care of my grandparents, who were very kind to me, yet it was not the same as having parents as my friends did. It wasnât until I was around 13 or 14 when my mother took over full time care of me, by which time it was too late for me to gather the classically happy childhood memories I feel Iâm lacking. Even when she took over my care, she was not really the perfect mother, not for lack of trying but due to a lack of experience, (she had me when she was very young compared to the average). She couldnât afford to rent a particularly nice place to stay, in fact it was so run down that I was too embarrassed to invite friends over. Sometimes she invited friends for me by asking their parents, but I soon put a stop to that when I discovered theyâd been talking about my house behind my back, commenting on how grotty it was compared to their middle class mansions in the suburbs. Times got so bad that, on multiple occasions, I remember being told to get on the floor and to be quiet whilst debt collectors hammered on the door in search of our meagre possessions to settle debts for necessities like electricity and gas.

I never knew my father either, in fact I didnât even know his name until about 2 years ago, when I found it out from my birth certificate. I then googled it and discovered he was a convicted paedophile which sent me into a downward spiral of self identity crisis. I always felt this lack of knowledge of where I come from. Friends who didnât understand would often ask me if I missed my dad or not and bullies who found out the information would often use it to their advantage.

I guess all in all what Iâm trying to say is I feel unsatisfied with my childhood, but I was never abused, verbally or physically. I was never homeless or reliant on food banks, despite being close on several occasions. I was always taught to be grateful for what I have. Like that classic quote says, âIf you have running water and a refrigerator, youâre better off than half of the worlds population.â Iâve always hated lines like that, Iâve certainly never felt better off, and even less so when compared to my peers. I quote that comes to mind is âI never wanted more than everyone else, just not the less I was used to.â I donât know if Iâm being melodramatic or if I have legitimate reasons to feel cheated. I guess Iâm just struggling with moving past darker days right now...

"Happy new year. A time when we both look toward the future and look backwards to the past. My future is a dark plcew, a horrible place of nothing but additional resonsibility, more expecttion, and yt more grief, more dissapointmnt, and more angisih. I feel as though I died many years ago. I am now thirty years old, and yet I attempted suicide in my late teens and early twenties. After theray and drugs, and finding true love, I recovered. But this is not  story of a mistreated hero. I am no antgonist of fiction, striving to overcome hardship. My hardship is of my own doing. My heartache is of my own creation. It is cliche to say that it is because I broke up with a girl. I broke her heart and now she is nothing mre than a distant memory. 

I am 30 now, but I figure I broke up with her about 6 or seven year ago. We were together for six years. I'd love to say I was different then but I'm quite sure I was more or less as I am now. This was the kind of love you find once in a lifetime. I have never communicated with one I felt so in tune with. I have never had someone be so patient with my issues. She forgave all my flaws and yet encouraged me to do better. For a while she made me feel as though I was someone ele. I told her I knew if we ever broke up it would be my fault, but she never believed me. 

I'm writing this now as an older man, supposedly moved on, supposedly mre sccesful. I am supposed to have learned and lived and fund new relationships. Many years ago she forgave me, and yet I feel mre and more grief as the years roll by. 

You see lthough I knew that I was incredibly lucky to have found love with oe such as her, I was totally and inexroably unfaithful. This woman loved me. I know this because she put up wit my flaws, and she taught me lie lessons I still repeat today. She is now with a man, or at least he was th last time we spoke, which was around three years ago. She looked healthy last I saw her, when she was with some new guy called Dave, and I noticed she looked so much healthier than I had ever seen her. She was so much more lifeike, confident, and vibrant than she ever was with me. I don't know if she is still with him. I a't brjng myself to messga eher, although not a minute of my waking life passes that she doesn't cross y mind. I miss her so much. Let me tell you that I miss her so very much. I have never told anyone close to me that I miss her, and even if I did tell any of my close confidants, I know no one from the time in which I know the girl I love, so to them it means very littele. More tan enanything in this world I miss her and I cannot possibly type this enough for it to portray how much I feel it. 

One night, 6 year ago or so, I ucked some other girl. I got drunk with a couple of friends on a randm nght out, lost contrl of my senses and my mind. Another girl, some stranger, some nothing, ws flirting with me, and through a series of terribe decisions I ended up sleeping with her within a couple of hours of meeting er As son as I it was done, I relaised what I had done. I called my ex, I tld her in no uncertain terms what I had done. THt I had cheated on her. I had slept with a stranger. I had been drunk. The scream. The scream of sheer angusih I heard down that phone haint s me even no. I cannot explain to you how much that killed me, istening to hr heart brek. This girl had put up with so much from me. She had gone through so much already and now this. That scream still haints me. She was on her way to the shops to pepare a nie surprise for us both when I told her this. She went back home nd I culd hear in her voice she was crying. I was staring at a wall, a foot away from it. I didn't feel like I was even me. I could hear ahe was crying. WHen she got back to her flat all I caould hear was her scream. She had held it in. She cried out, half echoing the word ""no"", half screaming and then she sobbed. I was whispering that I was so sorry. SHe screamed in the most cutting and now angry way ""Why?!""... ""Why would you?!"" I  just told her I was drunk, mindlessly drunk. SHe told me it was over. I agreed, I didn't blame her at all. I knew exactly what I had done. 

I have never been the same since. Judith has told me she forgives me. Was slept together after  year or so. SHe old me I need to learn to forgive myself. But this was five or o years go. Every day since I hve been a shell. I am not me. I diedd years go. I tried to kill myself before i knew her but never since. I just crrried on. I hate myself and my god, my gs. I have hated myself ever since. I am guilty. I m shameful. I broke dher heart. I am scum. I ha something perfect, and I reuined it. I mss her so much. 
I havehad a lot to drink. I tried to stop drinking sicne I cheated on her, blaming the alcohol But here and there, on nights like tonight, I have still turned to the bottle. I want to kill myself tonight. I hate myself. She is with another man, she is another persn, I am another person, she probably has kids by now. SHe is with me every waking hour and every waking day and my god I just can't forget wht I have done. I went back to university, decided to reinvent mysef and escape my past. But I haven't been happy in years. I cannot overcome this, and I should try to kill mmyself. I'm thinking of getting a lot more drunk and cutting my wrists or my throat. Deep enough that I bleed out in the bath. Even if it doesn't kill me, the act would bring me back to a time I feel more comfortable with. I have been so alone since this happened. THis is not the story of a person dealing with hardship. This is all my fault. I broke her heart. I just can't go on being this peron. I cnnot make sense of my narrative, I cannot make this sotry right. I do not want to break my mother's heart by killing myself. I t destroy her too. But I just can't go on anymore and I don't know what the fuk to do. lease if anyone can say anything that makes me feel remotely better, fuck it even if you just try, please do I will rad all of your messages. Please I just don't know what to do. ",4,"cheated on her, broke up with her, forgave all my flaws, feel more and more grief as the years roll by, never been the same since"
"//depressive rant
My friends always ask me why I never hang out with them. Not all the time, but whenever I do actually go out with friends it always comes up at one point. Yet nobody actively invites me to things. Sometimes they do, it seems random sometimes I don't particularly have one main group of friends. 

Honestly this is because I'm afraid. I'm afraid that if I actively tried to hang out with people, I'd end up scaring them away. I've kept myself locked up for years, because I always relied on people to invite me, rather than me planning it out/asking to join along. 

I'm not friendless, but I convince myself I am. I would sit in my house for a week, with my only social contact would be at work, and I'd get depressed. I'd feel lonely, feel like I have no friends, nobody to talk to. Yet people message me almost every day. I get invited to things occasionally, and some people have told me that I can hit them up if I ever want to hang out. But I never do. Not unless they invite me. I fucking hate myself.

//actual post

I didn't try today. I know I could have hit someone up, but I didn't. Someone asked me what I was doing today, told them I didn't know, they told me I should get fucked up with them. Never happened. I didn't even fucking try. Now I'm sitting at home, high as a fucking kite, have had a nasty anxiety attack the entire day, I'm fucking sick of it. My girlfriend is at work so I can't actually do shit. So fuck it. I'm getting high and playing video games, because fuck me.

EDIT: Since I'm high and on the self hate train that I'll have to clean up tomorrow, might as well go deeper because fuck it. I love how I paint this ugly picture and believe it's real.

"I really don't know what to do. The only time I don't feel this just... soul-crushing sadness is when I'm with who I consider to be my best friend. I'm really bad at talking to people and when I try to talk to people about my problems they often don't take me seriously. I also have really bad self esteem.

I've come to realize that what I used to think were good, close friends were just people who were just people that have the ""I'm here for you, but as long as I'm having fun"" mentality. Once I came to this realization, I stopped being the one to initiate conversations and activities outside of school and sure enough, almost none of them invite me to anything or talk to me outside of school and I'm left feeling just.. alone.

Every time I'm around the people who I consider to be my real friends, I feel a bit better. When I'm not talking, I constantly just feel useless, empty and alone. I know my parents love me but ever since I confronted my mother about my problems, she both blamed my problem on playing too much video games and basically told me just to be happy.

Very few things bring me happiness at this point. I thought starting a channel on Youtube and making videos regularly would help take my mind off of my problems so I did for a while. Over the course of a few months, I've gotten some really nice comments telling me that they genuinely enjoy my videos and that they'd like to see more, and that really made me happy. But then once that feeling wore off I felt like I was back to square one. I wish there was a way to enjoy my life without having to work my ass off for a temporary solution

Sometimes, when I'm alone, I just want to let it all out. I'll want to cry so badly but won't

"So I've felt this way for a while I'm 15 years old and a guy. I guess I've just lost confidence after this girl I put so much into sort of rejected me without asking her to go out (friend zoned me and has really sloppy replies now when I can see she is replying to others). My family constantly make jokes about me and say that I look retarded and ugly, etc. And I honestly just make jokes about it but it really effects me. I guess I just need to talk to someone as I've reached another new low. My friends don't really talk to me too much anymore, but give me confidence at the same time. I just feel so ugly as I can't even take a picture and look good, and I feel really ugly especially from the side. My nose is large and sticks out and my ears are ugly but hey I'm greatful still. I'm 5 ft 11 and weigh 135lb which is pretty light and I've been working out for about a month but stopped for the past week.

Iâm out of my anxiety meds, and have to wait until January to get more. I want to cry all the time. Even trying to get myself to wash my hair is hard. I canât even do that most of the time. I can only sit here wishing I was crying, but nothing is coming out. Itâs just tough right now guys. I havenât had interaction with anyone other than coworkers, and my parents for weeks. My mother, who I take care of, doesnât believe depression is even crippling. She takes it as a stunned toe, âjust walk it offâ. Iâm ready to feel normal again. Iâm tired of wanting any kind of attention just to feel loved for even a split second. I feel so absolutely useless in this world, but Iâm too exhausted to want to kill myself again.

"hey guys, this is something that i dont really do. Usually i use reddit for giggle and shits but now that im so depressed and desperate and i have no one to talk to i come here hoping i can pour my heart out before it pours blood out from sharp objects.

there's this girl, my best friend. Known her for like 3 years and i never thought i could love her so much, for in the past i saw her as annoying and stubborn and whiny but as time goes by i couldnt help but fell madly in love with her (without her knowing). I did make a move last summer but she straight out rejected me. We had a big fight and didnt talk to each other for like 2 months, worst 2 months of 2017, wanting to kill myself all the time and constantly being cynical to everybody. 

But we bumped into each other again at the end of November i think and she cried a lot and she hugged me saying she missed me so much and it was like, the warmest hug i've ever had in my entire life and at that moment i realized i dont want to lose her again, it kills me without her, inside and outside. 

But it's happening again, one night when a friend asked me how i was doing (he knew about my feelings for her) so i told him i still had the same feelings and he said that i should give up because she made it clear to him that she didnt want to take a step further with me. So i was very upset that night and i told him i couldnt because i was in too deep and i couldnt back out and nobody could help me back out and that he shouldnt care, nobody should care because i was dead, i was dead from inside to outside and nobody could help me. Only i could help me but i didnt want to. 

So my friend, i dont know what the fuck he has been thinking, thought it would be somehow of a solution to just tell her how am i feeling and you know what, she got all cold and wouldnt talk to me for weeks. I knew what was wrong but i pretended i didnt know anything. I dont want anything to mess with my head rn because im having an exam in a couple days. But i cant stand the harsh and dry tone when i wish her a nice christmas and new year and thank her for her christmas gift, i tried to ignore it and played it cool but deep down i just want to fucking kill myself to see if she cared. 

she said that we need to talk after my exam and i fear that i might get rejected again and it could also seriously damage our friendship too and i fear that we might break it. I dont want to loss her, she's the reason why i stopped thinking about killing myself buf i cant stand just being her friend. I sometimes think am i those cringy love desperate ""nice guy"" neckbeard who hates women because they reject them on the internet but i think im different. I've known this girl for 4 years now and i cant help but love her for who she is, not just some random hottie to DM on the internet. 

you guys can call me a wimp for whining over a subject that people constantly laugh at (the friendzone), i dont care, i just want to write something down to empty my thoughts for a while because the one person whom i always talk to when i have problems is now cold to me. Pls dont say there are other girls or there are many fishes or stuff like that, im told that and i also tell ppl that a lot and im sick of it. It's like when you're dying sick and the doctor tell you not to die and you can miraculously live. I spend too many brain cells picturing the hanging noose and pills and the razor and i smoked a lot (started smoking when she rejected me for the first time) and my chest hurt and i couldnt sleep well at night and i cant smile anymore.

if you make it down here i thank you sincerely for taking time to read and sorry for lack of punctuations and apostrophes because i write this feeling very bad and i couldnt cry though i want to but i just couldnt, i cant and my hands are shaking rn and i want to kill myself so bad rn. help me im suicidal, no you cant",4,"she straight out rejected me, wanting to kill myself, started smoking "

"Itâs almost 2018 and I have realized that this entire year will be added to the others that I have spent in a hellhole. I made a Reddit to rant to anonymous strangers on the internet and am feeling pathetic for it as no one would take me seriously if I said any of this in real life. I am fortunate and appreciate all thatâs been given to me in my life. However, I lacked a loving mother and father growing up and have always been subjected to, dare I call it, severe verbal discipline. Several hours of harsh yelling would be the result of accidentally forgetting to rinse out the mop as a third grader. There is only so many times someone can call you a stupid piece of shit before you believe it yourself. I became a nervous child, and never spoke until spoken to. I would be terrified to play outside of the privacy of a locked room. Despite this, I no longer hold blame to my parents. That is all that they were taught, although nothing can make it right. To this day, I panic when someone of authority even raises their voice slightly. But I believe that forgiveness may as well be the first step to forgiving myself. I am still young, 17, and I would like to say: DEPRESSION IS VERY REAL. It leaves you neglecting everyone around you and your personal hygiene. It saps away your ability to live. I thought I was just âgrowing upâ and that I would grow out of the âmoodsâ. But here I am, five years later, with the only thing stopping me from suicide being the thought of accidentally turning myself into a vegetable. I had suffered from a self harm addiction for the last year and I think Iâve kicked it for good. No one knew. Three rounds of antidepressants and attempts at therapy; yet, the fog still lingers.

"Iâm 26, all my friends are either happily in relationships or married and Iâm the only single one in the group and have been for a while and itâs been a long running joke amongst us. So much so that one of them tagged me in a Facebook post this morning that said âguess whoâs not getting a kiss on New Years.â I was the only one they tagged in it. 

Do you know how that feels? To have your fucking day ruined before you even get out of bed? It feels pretty goddamn amazing when youâve been numb to everything for a while.

Later on I had plans fall through with some engaged friends who decided theyâd rather spend the evening together just the two of them. Okay, thatâs fine, I understand they donât get much time together because of work but donât agree to make plans with me then decide last minute to change your mind. Especially on a night like tonight.

What else happened? Oh yeah.

I even asked the girl Iâm interested in if she felt like doing something with me tonight after she got of work. What was her response? 

âI donât.â

Wow, fucking 3 for 3. Iâm batting a thousand today in the âno one wants you aroundâ category.

So now Iâm laying in bed, itâs an hour and six minutes into 2018 where I live. Iâve been laying in bed for 4 hours listening to the soft whirring of the ceiling fan do a shitty job of drowning out the sounds of fireworks in the distance representative of people having a memorable evening with their friends and families. 

And Iâm just laying here. With this pain in my chest where I think my heart is supposed to be. Thereâs just a hole there. 

If I try to talk to anyone about it all I hear is âitâll happen somedayâ or some other bullshit disguised as encouragement from the people in my life who have never had to go through this because theyâre happier than theyâve ever thought they could be. 

If my friends were listening Iâd say Iâm sorry that Iâm being such a fucking rain cloud in your beautiful blue sky of a life, but fuck all of you, you donât understand what itâs like to be me. You donât know what itâs like to be in so much emotional pain all the time to the point where you canât even cry to maybe make yourself feel better because of everything being so piled up inside of you that you canât form a single tear. Fuck you. Fuck all of you. I love you all but it kills me to know what you have that I have envied for so long to call my own, if Iâll ever even have the capability to sustain something like that with how black and empty Iâve become watching you all with smiles on your faces every single goddamn day knowing that I canât feel the same way.",4,"numb to everything, piled up inside"

It was then that i decided to talk to one of my high school friend, and we continue to do that for until we became a couple. She is now my ex, she broke up with my, i'd spare you guys the detail but it's pretty much because of long distance relationship, my failure to realize it when she start to lose trust for me, and my stupidest decision ever. 2017 could have been my year, i found job at a place where the co-worker is friendly, and the boss treat me like family. I was in love someone who make me realize what it feel like to truly be in love, who can love me unconditionally. I could have it all, a good job, a wonderful family with her and my kid, yet I fucked it all up because i think too much, i worry too much about the future, about thing that may or may not happen, that i forgot about what important is in the present. I worked too hard for our future when i neglected her in the present, she began to lose trust in me, she was in pain because she think i abandoned her, and I didn't even realize it. Then she made a choice, she decided that she no longer love me and can't continue this relationship anymore. I can't get her to stay, nothing i said matter anymore, i was too blind to see that the girl i love the most was hurt be none other than me.

I cannot give you any highlights of my life because there weren't any for me. Just a lot of crying and regrets. I have no friends or social life, so it's really hard for me to do anything eventful. I just sit in my room alone trying to pass time with the internet. I hate it so much. It is ironic with me because I hate how much technology has advanced (social media wise) and how people are always on their devices nowadays, yet when you look at me .. I am doing what I hate other people doing. Sometimes I feel like if I grew up in the 80s, my life wouldn't be so bad. I wouldn't have a computer, phone, etc to occupy me so I would not feel tired or useless and instead put effort into making friends. 

To anyone who read this, thank you so much. I don't post on here very often and just wanted to feel less alone by interacting with you all (since I am of course not doing anything exciting for new years). Happy New Years to you all regardless.

"First off i have been suffering with depression for more 4 years now but i have not seen a therapist. Its has been intermediate with me wanting to do things then not. But now i am in bad shape, i have completely lost track with every one in my life. I cant do simple task anymore. I suffer from insanely bad mood swings, for instance i was just on my computer playing games then 5 minutes later i had 10+ painkillers hoping that i would die in my sleep that night. I now dont eat much at all and i stay up until about 5:00 am each night. I am starting to get suicidal thought more and more recently. I have also gone back to cutting my self. I hate myself. Im just a fat piece of s*** in high school that im the butt end of every joke. I dont want to be made fun of anymore, When i do go to a friends house my parents make fun of me because they think im a nerd that hangs out with other nerds. I am just tired of all of this. I want it to end. Im a failure to my parents, my friends, my self. I have started to not talk to any of my friends. I know it would help to talk to them but they donât understand anything i say. They just say âHaHa Sameâ ironically. They think im joking but im not, my hole life has become a joke for others. Its hard for me to just get the motivation to get up on a weekend.

"Posted on this /r/sexuality and I want to post it here since this subreddit is more active.
--

I am a male and I'm 19, I go to college. I have never been happy and content in my life, severe depression that's been on for 4+ years is one of the root causes. Depressed because I have no intimate interactions with females, who I am absolutely attracted to. Three ago I started experiencing thoughts that I would truly find happiness if I were born a female and I don't really know how I find solute in that thought - maybe because of my limited experience with women, but I do not know for sure.

I lost my virginity after two days of my 18th birthday to a hooker and I didn't even get to finish. I've only hooked up with one girl when I was 17 and that included only making out and that was it, apart from those two experiences I have other sexual experience whatsoever.

I need some help to understand my own self and why I feel this way, maybe it's because I need to get more experience with women? (Which is another problem.)

"Yesterday it was the 31st. My aunt's birthday. She is 70 years old.

I used the last bit of my money to buy her pizza, wings, and fries. You know, to treat her. I even massaged her back. I offered to do other stuff for her should she need it, like I always do.

Do you know what happened in the end? She stormed out of my apartment, screaming at me about how much she hates me for ""envying"" her. She randomly brought up topics of the past. Some of which aren't true, such as her saying I abused my cousin back when he lived near me. I've treated her to so much in the past few months, and I thought such a nice gesture would make her happy. I guess not.

""If this is my last day on Earth, good, because now you know the truth.""

An actual quote from her.

Yesterday, on the 31st, I tried to be a good person. I was left crying in my bedroom instead. Now it's 2018. And things look bleak. My boyfriend recently broke up with me. During my relationship with him, I was the happiest I have been in a long time, perhaps ever. I had 0 suicidal thoughts while in that relationship. Now it feels like he's ignoring me despite wanting to just ""be friends"".

Anyone could read this, even people I know, but I don't care. I don't care about anything anymore. I'm left wanting to die constantly. Anything is better than continuing to live this life I live. I just don't care anymore. I don't matter. I'm useless. My own mother is mentally unstable, and now I am too. I inherited it. The conditions I grew up in made me who I am now. I can't get a job. I can't get money. I can't be happy.

I'm a 19 years old girl, never been with a guy, only with a woman. I consider myself bisexual. I've been watching porn since 9 or I think much more younger than that. 

I grew up on a terrible family. During nights when I was young I always hear my Mother and Father having sex, worst even if I'm sleeping beside them. Sometimes, I think it is a make up sex that theyre are doing..

When I was young, I really had a thing with older men. Ive been groped a lot of times.. and the worst thing is that I actually enjoy it. It made me feel arouse when someone is groping me and I dont know why. That's why in porn, I'm being aroused as well with groping or.. force or worst gang sex whatever they call that. I used to masturbate and still masturbating for it.  I dont know why am I so into it even if I know that porn industry is evil and I dont ever want to be raped. I dont want casual sex as well.. but still I find myself masturbating to it and being so aroused by it.

"I moved to Toronto for school and no one came with me . Not one of my friends, or even other people I know went to Toronto for school. The only time I talk with my friends is when we play video games, and none of them show even any remote amount of interest in my life outside that. These are people Iâve known since elementary school.

I had another group of friends I thought I was getting closer with, we were supposed to go to a New Years party together. They ditched me, Iâm not sure why, or what happened. I think it might have been accidental, but none of them cared enough to try and fix it.

Also just found out the first group of friends had a New Years party. I didnât get invited, even though Iâm back in town for the holidays. 

And thatâs it. Thatâs all my friends. Everyone Iâm even remotely close with. Thatâs it.

"Just today.

Suddenly feeling utterly hopeless. I haven't fantasised about dying since the short time I did 3 years ago.

I feel no interest in doing anything else since Sunday... not schoolwork, continuing to look for a job, gaming, reading, watching movies or anything today. I have written a haiku but that is all I have done this morning. I like their syllable structure and it's easy to work with. I have started trying writing poetry a little bit just this weekend as oddly enough I am interested in that.

I have been fantasising about dying since yesterday. I guess because I feel like I already am dead. I can't tell anyone or more therapist because they'll probably lock me up in a hospital or something and that is neither pleasant for me, plus it would inconvenience everyone else.

Since playing this stupid horror game for a little bit today that a friend has recommended, the fantasies have gotten a bit more intense. I am not going to actually do it but it is weird to me that usually my depression manifests itself as only apathy with hopelessness. Now I feel pure despair and almost a self indulgent desire to pass away and not have to fight anymore.

I just really, really want to give up. I have a great family, great educational opportunities, decent health and a family that help me through so much of my stupid shit. I am a useless sack of shit that i can't take advantage of all the things I have going for me. I think literally everyone would be better off not having me around. I feel like such a burden to everyone yet they don't want me to relieve them of that burden (me) and me of my burden (having to keeo fighting myself) and it feels bad. I have not felt such a strong emotion as this despair in a long time now.

"I met my best friend in freshmen year of college. I had been suffering at my worst from my depression prior to that year in high school. Fall semester of freshmen year was the first time in about 5 years that I almost felt ""normal."" That friend was my dorm mate. We were completely randomized but hit it off really well since the beginning. We spent so much time together all of our mutual acquaintances would ask where the other was if absent. Then came spring semester and the depression was back full blown. We both have depression the kind right now where you don't feel anything, and nothing excites you anymore. It started to get noticeably worse for the both of us as school progressed. We're both involved in creative majors and so the anxiety of wether or not to chase a creative path is worth it or not is a main form of anxiety for the both of us. For me it's a bit better because art has been something I've been wanting to do all my life and can't see myself doing anything else. Slowly our relationship just began to deteriorate. We'd go to the same hangouts, do the same things, become bored of it, started becoming more irritable with each other, have less and less to talk about, and eventually have nothing at all to say to each other. It was devastating, meeting up for a hangout and seeing that they obviously didn't want to. They have another friend they're close to but unlike me is someone quite extroverted and humorous with a vibrant personality. I'm more shy and my depressive episodes involve a lot of me just wanting to be left alone. 

They're a bit of the passive aggressive type but I can always see what they're feeling wether they say it or not. We had been close for such a long time and then all of a sudden this other friend had become their #1. I've had trauma in the past where friends have left me in the dust so it doesn't hurt as much as it did during those times but it does sting a little. My attitude towards it is that I just give up. I don't care anymore. I see when they third wheel me and I just don't have the energy to give a shit anymore. I want to slowly fade away. I feel like I've tried my best to rekindle what we had, but it becomes a little tiring when it's all one-sided. It sucks that I feel this way on New Years, so honestly I just want to let it go. I have another really good friend which I'm fortunate to have and I will continue to put effort into the relationships that deserve it. I came to rant about this, but I feel a lot better now getting it off of my chest. I'll be looking into seeing a doctor for the first time ever about my depression and I'm feeling hopeful.

For reference, I'm 21 and female.

First of all, I have a sister who is depressed. I know what that looks like: she contemplates the futility of her existence; she thinks she's worthless and generally has a deep-seated self hatred; on bad days, she cries herself to sleep and on the worst days she doesn't feel anything at all. I support her as best I can, but she often gets frustrated with me because I seem very far-removed from her mindset. I've always been a happy person, self confident (some might say to the point of arrogance), productive, etc. In particular, my sister cares a lot about what people think of her, and she often grows impatient with my inability to empathise with that position.

As much as I can enjoy living, I have no attachment to it. It's like the self-preservation instinct isn't there. I don't fear death, and I've experienced a good amount of physical pain in my life and I don't fear that either. I often just feel very removed from myself - disassociated - as if I'm looking from myself from very far away. Often I don't think of myself as a person but as a function of my activities (recently, a lot of work). Yes, I love people and I take an interest in intellectual material and I live both for the people in my life and my inner world, but if it makes any sense it often feels like my inner world itself is an external phenomenon, like I have no self. To borrow a line from Sylvia Plath: ""I am nobody. I have nothing to do with explosions."" And if it offers any insight: I don't cry very much, but when I do it's almost never for myself - it's for something larger and more abstract, like the Holocaust, or the rape crisis in India.

I just don't know what's wrong with me. I can be charming and engaged - I'm a creative type and very tactile. I'm confident in myself. Above all, I am happy making meaning within my own life, at peace with the knowledge that its significance is purely relative. But when I refer to myself it feels like I'm referring to some construction outside of myself, like the 'I' is still some distance away. For that reason, my self-preservation instinct in pretty switched off. I often think of death - not in a longing way, just in a morbidly curious way. Everything I value I can just as easily disengage, because those values seem arbitrary. The world is a beautiful place but it will keep turning without me (and everyone else). I don't think I'll ever kill myself, but my detachment sometimes scares me.

Is this normal, to an extent? Or is something wrong with me?",4,"sister who is depressed, often grows impatient with my inability to empathise with that position.

"My parents are divorced since I was 3. No big deal, many people started off worse. I've been living with my mom and rarely meet my dad because I'm too busy. Recently, I met up with my dad and my foster mother, and they thought I might have some psychological problems. Not severe, but still. They wanted to get me checked out. But my mom don't agree. She thought the other parents were overreacting. Personally I do feel off balance at times, and I WOULD get myself tested just to see if I'm okay or not. But even when I expressed that wish, mom still wouldn't take it more seriously and ignore it.
I don't want to come to my dad crying out for help because that would just make my mom and dad argue once more, and many many more problems regarding my family might ensue. But I still feel really upset with the fact that mom wouldn't get me any help even though it costs her nothing.

"First post here, and I actually hoped that I never felt like I needed to address these things. 

It's new years eve, its 5am here in Denmark. And i'm done.

So long story short.
I was 130kg (287 pounds) at 15 years old. My parents pretty much didnt really care, and all that.
When i turned 15, i knew there was 6-7 months for high school to start, so i joined a gym. Read all i could online. Lost 40kg, at for the first time looked like a human being. Yet, I couldnt get with any girls. I was pretty much ""broken"" in the head for being too fat and weird. I didnt give it. I read Mystery Method, The Game, practiced all the time, and had some luck. I finished high school, and after that, my genetics pretty much fucked me over. 

Keep in mind, I work out 5 days a week. I even became a personal trainer. But my genetics makes it very difficult to lean down all the way, and i also (like my father, and brother) have a pretty chubby face.  im in my mid 20's and my hair is thinning so bad, and people keep mentioning this. 

Im the ugly guy, in my group, even though im the person who spends most time taking care of myself. But im just ""gentically ugly"" so to speak. Ive seen so many girls around me, hook up with wrong guys, and ""friend zoning"" me. I had a crush on a girl, who hooked up with a 20 year old idiot douche, just because he is better looking, basically because of genetics. 

I hate this. I dont deserve it. I always try my hardest. Best at my school at software programming, best at most things that I do, because i keep figting for what i want. But I dont wanna do this shit anymore. Im giving up. Im not getting any ""wins"" with my life. I see myself struggling and fighting so much more than other people my age...

im in my mid 20's. This should be the best years of my life, but im only getting uglier, and I cant take it anymore...

sheâs at my school &amp; i have a girlfriend at the time. but i really felt megan like really felt for her &amp; i still do... but now danny, megan, and gwen go everywhere together &amp; all 3 hate me. gwen cut me off cause iâm âsketchyâ, danny pretends to be my friend but turn on me &amp; consistently make plans w/o me &amp; megan. i try SO hard to be her friend and itâs just not working. she avoids me &amp; it fucking torture. i lost her, and i knew i deserved it. i shouldâve never argued, i shouldâve never said anything. it constantly pains me, watching her smile with all my âoldâ friends. i just need advice or help. i just need a glimmer of hope.",4,"we have officially âtakenâ each other, but she still hasnât broken up with one of my best friends danny"
"Holidays are over. Christmas presents are opened, food has been eaten, the old year is done and the new year has begun.

When I get back to work the inevitable question will come up: ""How was your holiday?""

I will answer ""It was alright."", or ""Just fine, nothing special."" or I will outright lie and say ""Was a fun time and got to spend some time with family.""


**What I really mean is:**


I spent my christmas alone. There were no presents, there was no family dinner. I spent christmas eve laying on the couch, sick with the flu and fever, eating microwaved pasta while watching christmas movies on Netflix, which honestly makes me even more depressed but I enjoy watching them nonetheless. 

On the day after christmas I spent the day gathering enough willpower and strength to go outside, not because I wanted to, but because my headache was killing me and I needed both painkillers and more food since my fridge was literally empty. Trip to the gas station for junkfood and painkillers was the 'highlight' of christmas for me.


On new years eve I was still a bit sick. I heard the first fireworks go off around 8 or 9pm. I kind of wanted to go outside and see them, but then I knew I would be standing alone like an outsider and watching the fireworks would be more likely to make me cry than smile. People may wonder why. Watching fireworks which is supposed to be happiness and bring in the hope of a new year. I see no joy or hope in the next year. Instead I see another year, another 365 nights of loneliness and darkness, another 12 months of coming up with excuses to avoid social gatherings and family events. Not that I get invited to those much anymore anyways. I went to bed at 10pm and slept until late in the morning. Happy new years to me.


**I will never tell my coworkers this, nor my family.**


Why would I? It just makes them sad too, and I don't want to make others depressed and talking about it just makes me sad and upset to the point where I end up in tears myself. I have no desire to be in tears in front of anyone or drag them into the dark pit where I'm stuck. Besides, what reason do I have to be sad or depressed? I have a nice job, stable economy and live well. If I was to really tell them how I feel I fear it would sound like whinging, complaining, being 'an entitled ass' or worse.


I know my friends probably think I don't like being with them since I almost always end up declining invitations, or just canceling in the last minute. I really do want to be with them, but when the moment comes it feels overwhelming, I feel out of place, I'm anxious and upset cause I don't want to bring down their joy. They invited me to christmas parties the previous years. This is the first year where I never heard anything from any of them...

I know my family probably thinks I'm upset with them or angry for something since I never show up for family dinners and events anymore. They didn't invite me this year either.

I know my coworkers probably think I'm just a misfit or arrogant since I decline every teambuilding and social gathering at work. That, and I generally eat my lunch alone by my desk rather than going to the cafeteria with everyone else. The few times I went I end up not talking anyways and just withdraw. I'm sure they think I am being rude or anti-social on purpose.


I love my friends, my family and I enjoy working with my coworkers.


But when they ask ""How was your holiday?"" how can I do anything but dodge the answer or lie?

It's just scary man, like not knowing if he's gonna be there the next morning you know?

"Itâs currently 4 in the morning and Iâm feeling very stuck. I feel like nothing has changed since I can remember. For some background, Iâve had depression since about middle school. I guess I still donât know if I want to call it depression since I havenât been diagnosed yet but Iâve always just had trouble finding any positivity in my life. In school Iâve never been popular but I could be considered as well liked. From what I know most opinions of me are positive but as I said thatâs from what I know. My response to being sad has always been to try and focus on other peopleâs problems and try and help them. The problem with this is that all this has done is made me worse off. I feel like no one puts in as much effort into relationships as I do. Friends always seem to be eager to take my advice and then when I ask for help they run. The person I considered to be my best friend did this to me over the course of last year and Iâm still sad about it. We stopped talking for a few months and today they invited me to hang out with them on New Yearâs Eve but, while I still care about them, I donât want to put myself back  into a relationship where I put my all into it and then I ask for help and end up getting hurt. They tried to help me in the first 2 months that they knew about my depression (I feel like they actually did help me for the duration of the 2 months but for some reason that is hard to admit) and then after that he just gave up on me. That hurt more than anything else because I know I would never give up on him. In the absence of him for the last few months Iâve tried to go to counseling at my school. That worked for a week and then after some work I realized I should get a therapist to help. The counselor had to call one of my parents because, being a minor, I have to get parental consent to get a therapist. She never did. Itâs been about there weeks since she said she would do it. That really helps. Now Iâm stuck trying to solve my situation alone because Iâve been in it for so long that Iâve isolated myself from others. The point where I held a gun to my head and almost killed myself is when I think I finally realized something was very wrong with me mentality and I needed to do something about it. That was 6 months ago. Help feels like itâs so hard to find. My counselor hasnât helped, my parents havenât, and my past best friend hasnât. I also have other âfriendsâ that I found security in and then I realized that they talk about me behind my back and make fun of my depression. They also make fun of the same thing with another friend of mine who is in that group and that pisses me off more then them talking about me. 2017 has been the worst year of my life. At least I learned that I need help but itâs been so hard to find. Itâs made my depression worse and Iâm starting to lose hope again. In 2018 at the least Iâll try to look at things more positively this year. All that I know is that 2017 has taught me that good help is hard to find. That is why Iâm sitting here at 4am on a reddit account I just created venting to the void.
Thanks for reading my huge wall of text. I hope something in all of my rambling possibly related to you and helped a little bit. Good luck in 2018 and I hope this year works out for you. I know I need it to work out for me. Thanks again and have a happy New Year.

"Hi. First, English is not my first language, so some sentences might be weird. I post here because there's no other place better than here. People in my country will definitely blame or laugh at me.

But recently after I saw one of my old classmates becomes a professional translator and another becomes a writer who have published 2 novels, I start to doubt that. I feel uncomfortable. And I'm uncomfortable for feeling uncomfortable, because they were my friends. I feel awful. I don't know why. I feel shame. I think that although I have been knowing that I'm a loser, but it feels so much different when you see the real distance between you and others. It hurts.

A lots of people here suggest that it's better to just delete social medias. But that somehow makes me feel awful too. It's like, if I did it, it means I officially admitted I can't accept that others are getting successful but I am not. I feel there's a voice in my head laughing at me: ""Hey, look at what you want to do. You feel awful for seeing others being successful, and your way to solve this is, ha, to delete your social media? Instead of getting inspired and start to work hard and get your shit together? You just ganna run away? Pathetic!"".

My ideal life has always been to have a happy family. But I'm a very shy person, and never really liked the social scene. It makes it really hard to meet new people, but by a stroke of luck i met the most amazing girl back on September 30 2001(i was 18). We quickly fell in love, had a daughter, and got married. I thought we were a match made in heaven. I loved my life, i had everything i ever wanted. She made me want to be the best person i could be. I love this woman with every fiber of my being, but in early 2007 we hit our first road bump. She said she was unhappy and wanted a divorce. I tried everything to repair our marriage. I spent thousands of dollars on couples counseling, therapy, and spent every waking moment trying to resolve our issues. I found out 6 months into or troubles that she was sneaking around behind my back and sleeping with an old friend of hers from school(while we were still married). Even with that being the case, i still tried to fix our relationship because all i ever wanted was a complete family and for her to be happy. I guess her mind was made up though, because right after new years 2008 she gave me divorce papers. I love her and didn't want to fight it and cause her anymore stress so i signed the divorce papers bawling like a baby. The divorce was pretty much a 50/50 split but i let her take everything but our daughter and my PC, again because all i wanted was for her to be happy. Hell, i didn't even ask for child support even though i did everything for our daughter. I still tried to talk to her and let her know she was still very much loved, but soon after the divorce she remarried to the guy she cheated on me with. So, for the last 10 years i have been alone with just me and my daughter. I've tried to meet new women but i can't seem to find anyone that wants to be with me for more than a couple dates. I think it's because my depression, but i don't know. I haven't even had sex since 2007. I've tried apps and going to bars, but i don't drink alcohol so i feel awkward. I'm tired of being alone. I was raised by my grandparents and they have since passed on. I have NOBODY in my life that loves me besides my daughter. I want to find someone that can love me and my little girl as much as i could love them, but @ 35 years old it's beginning to feel impossible. Why won't anyone love me back? What is wrong with me? How can i find someone to love? I'm scared of dying alone. I'm worried my heart will remain broken till my death. I'm not a bad guy. I work very hard to make sure my daughter is happy, but without a proper mother figure i fear her life will mirror mine, and honestly if it wasn't for her i would've bitten the bullet years ago.

"As the title suggests I could really use some advice. Iâve been struggling with depression for years, with this latest episode affecting me since mid-November. It is now January 2018 and although Iâve had some good times and didnât really feel depressed over the Holidays, it all just came flooding back last night.

All of my friends ended up bailing on me on New Years so I spent the night alone in my room until I fell asleep around 9 pm. I woke up around 3 in the morning and stupidly checked my phone. When I did I saw all the friends that bailed on me at different parties, surrounded by others, having fun. This sent me spiraling back into depression and I found myself close to ending my life with a belt which Iâve read can be very painless. I was able to take some medication that helped me go to sleep again and get through the night.

Itâs now 1:30 in the afternoon and I still feel the same way with absolutely nobody to talk to about this because I donât want to be that person that brings somebody down on New Years.

It just feels as if no matter what medications I take, whatever therapist I have, and even with these group therapy sessions Iâve been attending, I always end up back on the train to death. Itâs starting to feel like the only solution as Iâve tried making some major changes in my life and none of them have made any impact when others have told me they would.

Any time I get quiet for a while, he stops contacting me. Even for months at a time. Then when I come back again, crying about my own problems, he's there to listen. Patiently.

It's obvious I'm not his friend. He tells me he's glad we met. But he only talks to me for my benefit. He's doing a good deed.

To cut a long story short, I've had this crush on a girl for well over a year now. Not a day goes by when I don't think about her and checking her social media accounts has became part of my daily routine. She lives overseas and there is a significant age difference, I'm 15 and she's 20. 


For a few hours after I wake up, she's all I think about and it causes a nauseating feeling in my stomach. (Also, has anyone else been through this or know what it is?)

Unlike most crushes, I recognise her flaws. She's passive aggressive, a humble bragger, a control freak, a spoilt girl who grew up in a mansion. But she's not an awful person, far from. I relate to her in so many ways. That's how I can see through her little act. She's insecure about her appearance and how people perceive her and has admitted to being depressed in the past. 


I only know her through her social media presence. But I'm certain I would make her so happy if I were her boyfriend. I'd take care of her, let her cry in my arms and vent about her problems all night. I'd take care of her.


I suppose some things aren't meant to be, we live in different countries, we're different ages and she doesn't even fucking know me. Despite this, I can't just get over her and move on. I can't even distract myself, all I think about is her. Like I've said, I've been this way for years. Is this fate trying to tell me there is a chance or just my depression trying to beat me down and get me to get my hopes up?


Anyone been through anything like this or know how to move forward? Also, sorry about the cringe-worthy ""I'd be good the best boyfriend"" speech I typed out earlier. I know it's so clichÃ©, but I think it needed to be said. 


Oh, and happy New Years!",4,"social media presence, she's all I think about, a nauseating feeling"

"I started to think recently on how toxic my parent's behavior has been over the years, but since every time I tried to call them out they dismissed me I struggled with seeing those things as emotionally abusive, just a clash of personalities with them being overly harsh and me being overly sensitive, and I feel guilty since I know they love me and have always provided for me and that there are people that have much worse parents. I started to list out the things my father done, since they started earlier(around when I was 7-ish) than my mother's and I believe have been much more impactful:

* Made fun of me to the ladies working at a clothing store's changing area because I didn't know how to tie my shoelaces

* Yelled at me for spilling a soft drink on my shirt

* Yelled at me whenever I got the answer wrong when helping me with math one time

* Broke a game's cd rom in front of me because he could not figure out the puzzle

* Yelled at me for throwing a soft drink can on the garbage at school because I struggled to open it and was too shy to ask for help

* Yelled at me for letting kids at class use my empty water bottle to mix things different drinks in

* Grounded me on summer vacation because my cousin was bossing me around but didn't say a word to my cousin or my uncle

* Yelled at me in front of extended family in christmas and told me to go to bed early because one of the kids was bossing me around

* Never tried to hide that he puts his siblings over us, said christmas without them is not christmas, and once we didn't even celebrated it because my mother wanted just the four of us at home and he got angry about it. Always antagonizes us when he's around his family and makes us feel like burdens and annoyances to them.

* Told me I have shit on my head because I forgot to bring a coat when spending a whole day at my friend's house, never mind the fact that it was just two blocks away from mine and my father would drive me back.

* Once me and my brother were bickering and I accidentally hit his glasses, he shouted so my father entered the room, yelled and made us sleep early.

* When I came out I asked for a gender therapist or just someone with experience with trans patients, he got me a therapist who never had a trans patient before and was obsessed with having me remember the event in my childhood that triggered by dysphoria and dismissed my body issues because ""women have body hair too"" instead of actually helping me.

* I found a gender therapist so I gave him her contact info and said I wanted to see her instead, he said he'd call her. Months after I asked him about it, he just tells me she's ""biased""

* Up until I was 18 he'd always force me to get a haircut once my hair was long enough to partially cover my ears, my hair was always thick and hard to manage and he always gave me shit about it. One time he thought I asked the hairdresser to just trim the absolute minimum and went on a fit about how if I wanted to cut my dick off that's fine but he was not going to be a part of it.

* To this day he acts like me coming out never happened, the last he commented on it was years ago saying that I should study, find a job and then I can do anything I want to. I opened up despite how painful it was in the time I need his help the most and he just removed himself from that responsibility.

* Mocked the way I speak by mimicking me in a tone of voice as if he was imitating a disabled person more than once

ï»¿* He knows I'm scared of elevators since I'm 5 but always dismissed it, one day as a teen we were on one and the door kept opening and closing, it was fairly crowded with a baby stroller no less, I begged him to let us leave because I was terrified, he then yelled at me in front of everyone and told me he'd never take me out again.

* Around the same time we were on a mall's bookstore, he showed me a book but I wasn't interested, partially because of being severely depressed, he flipped at me and ran to the parking area to leave, with the rest of us having to follow him. Then went on a rant all the way back home.

* I lost count of how many mornings I woke up during a weekend to him washing the dishes while complaining at how much of a failure I am

* Dismissed and belittled my concerns, fears and problems over the years always saying something like ""what are you going to do about it"".

* Belittles my interests for being childish according to him.

* Get's angry at me for being scared of bugs and other ""feminine"" attitudes.

* Always makes me into the unreasonable one whenever I got visibly upset or angry at his behavior that he never apologizes for

* Always acts like he knows me better than I know myself, always sees malice in my thoughts and actions because ""he was once my age"". He never believes I'm genuine with the things I want or do, I'm always doing things because everyone is doing it.

* Constantly lies about things like pretending he took the dog to the vet, that he could not find something we asked him to buy, etc.

* Always use us as his emotional and verbal punching bags when he's frustrated at something or someone

* I always have to compromise, like not transitioning or always having my hair up now that it's long, but he never makes an effort to change or police himself on the things I've said that bother me over the years.

* To this day whenever he raises his voice or get angry even if I have nothing to do with it I get panicky.

* I feel like I have to walk on eggshells with him, if I say the wrong thing (speak my mind) or react the wrong way(react naturally) he's going to flip on me.

I was close to my father when I was very very young but the behaviors I listed started happening around when I was 6-7 so it's pretty much since then that I started to become distant, he feels like a stranger to me since I was about 14. With my mother we were pretty close and got along very well up until I was about 14. She's always been an anxious and jealous person but the bad things that happened in her past plus a lot of stress over the years made her insufferable. On top of anxious and jealous she's controlling, critical and judgemental. If I don't do things her way she won't stop criticizing me, if I call her out she starts pointing out my flaws. She's always looking for a opportunity to turn anything into a fight and then play victim and make everything about herself. If I get angry at her she just says I'm crazy and need to go to a mental asylum. She told me so many hurtful things over the years since I came out, that I'm retarded, that I'm a curse in her life, that she should have been a whore instead of a proper woman, etc. I can tell she regrets it after as she tries to hug and kiss me but she never apologizes. 

I know deep down they both love me and want the best for me, they had always provided and praised me and done what they could but when it comes to the emotional side of things I think they managed to break me completely while being completely oblivious to it, always suggesting I'm ""tired"" and ""moody"" due to a poor diet and lack of exercise and wondering why I'm like this or why I feel so uncomfortable next to them. I'm severely depressed, have social and some general anxiety to the point I'm practically a shut in right now with no will to live, I get that there are things I could do do make my life better, I just don't see the point anymore.",4,"emotionally abusive, walk on eggshells with him, complaining ,Dismissed ,belittled ,Made fun, Yelled, Mocked, jealous"

"2017 was rough. My brain fell into cycles of self degradation way too easily, this led me down a spiral this year which made me end a long relationship, lose some friends, and made me put duties that would have helped me to the wayside like taking my dog out.

The past few months leading to now has been anti social to say the least. I stopped trying to make plans with friends as I was tired of hearing no, my friends clearly didn't want me around a whole lot (since September I had a total of 2 outings with friends, pre September we spent probably too much time together at ~6 days a week). On top of that another good friend of mine moved away indefinitely. 

2017 I realized I can't rely on my friends the way I thought I could, I wish I could but life doesn't work like that. My New Years resolution this year is to not base my happiness and social success around if my friends and I are having fun. I've realized I don't need my friends to go play an open Mic night, or go see a movie, or to go for a hike, in fact a lot of these are better done alone.

"For the past few days, I've been miserable. Hit a new low kinda miserable. My parents snapped at me, not knowing so. They threatened to kick me out and so i just walked out. Grabbed my pack and just ran. They tried to bring me back. T'was a whole chase scene with jumping over walls and shet. 

But i couldn't. After however many hours, I went back. I never got anything when I returned but a single lecture about how nobody is gonna care if I do it again bc I'm 19. They're probably right.

Word travels fast in my family, and I believe I've ruined New Years for everyone. I dont want to face everyone anymore. None of them understand what I'm going through. I have no friends to talk to anymore. My brother and sister ignore me and dont like me. My parents also ignore what I'm going through and suggest that I shouldnt be depressed bc theyre depressed even more. All my aunts and uncles who think they help say that too.

And even if i do, i wont know how to start my life back again and for that, I'm scared. Even so, im considering doing things i would never have done before.

"My depression has been up and down over the past 2 years. I've hit my lowest lows, but bounced back towards the highest highs. Recently it seems like I'm slowly going back down, and there's no incline in sight. If everything keeps going the way it is, I'll be farther down than I've ever been. When I was at my lowest, I was pretty ready to take my life. I felt almost a sensation of peace over myself knowing that soon enough I'll never have to feel this way again. I ended up not going through with it, and I talked myself away from those feelings for a good while, and I was feeling good. 

Now I have a kid on the way, almost halfway to the due date, and I'm going back down in the rut. It makes me feel like a complete piece of shit, but knowing that I can't just end it anymore is making it harder to deal with. In the past I've always had suicide as a plan if all else failed, and it made me feel a bit better knowing, if anything, it could all end. But with a kid on the way, I don't dare even think about it. I wouldn't want to have her resent me, or feel guilty in anyway, and now I can't seem to get over this feeling. 

On top of it all, my wife knows of my depression, but overall it feels like it's just a burden to her. I don't even want to talk to her about it anymore because it makes me feel like I'm just complaining and loathing in my own self pity. I'm just stuck where I am, and I hate it more than anything. 

As is, I don't have insurance, or really any money, so I can't seek out medical help. The only other people who I know that have depression is my mom and a friend. But my friend just makes jokes about it, and I have too high of anxiety to talk to my mom about it.

"From what I've seen, people suffering from depression feel down even though things around them are somewhat okay. As for me, I just got divorced, my ex-wife is an incredibly manipulative narcissist, and we have a young child together. She's accused me of horrible things that I would never do in a failed attempt at full custody. I'm constantly battling her over our child. In the past she has successfully isolated and controlled me through guilt and accusations. She almost succeeded in manipulating the courts. The legal fees appear to be leaving me bankrupt. My thoughts are full of her, her constant false accusations and how to defend against them. I'm on a tenure track at a university, but that job is f-ed now because I can't concentrate on my research for longer than 5 minutes. So yeah, I'm kind of feeling down. My ex is abusive and is so good at it that the legal system and even women's abuse counselors will back her and protect her. I'm in therapy. Started going to church. Prayer helps me get back to sleep now. Trying to cut down on drinking. Exercising a lot. Still can't focus on work, so I'm now focusing on how to change careers and stay in the same area (close to our child.) What should I do? Am I suffering from depression?

"I want to talk to somebody but don't know how. I yearn for some decent human connection, yet I don't know how to connect. I have friends.

But it's not just hard, it seems next to impossible. I know a few places where I can meet people that I find interesting, but there are several but's. One of those places is a sort of a board game parlour. But that's one place. And I'm afraid that if I screw that up I won't be able to come there no more, or I'll have to avoid certain people. I feel like I might lose those opportunities and be left with no opportunities. And that scares me. I'm scared of being hopeless again. Because it's awful to have no hope and know you'll never have any glimmer of hope again. If only I had a group of best friends I could rely on, sort of a safe net, someone that's always there. But there are no people like that in my life. Let's say friends are coffee mugs and my life is a table. Most of the coffee mugs are near the edge, some are even halfway over the edge, always in danger of falling over, all it takes is one false move. Talking to someone new is like putting a new mug right on the edge, half on the table, half over the edge. It's fucking nuts. I can't take those risks, I suck, I know, but I can't. I'm not very interesting (at first at least) or articulate and a lot of people find that annoying. Even talking to people on social networks is scary. I just hate that sound of a ceramic mug  breaking on the hard floor. Most people do I think. When something beautiful full of possibilities breaks.

I feel trapped, I don't know what to do. Today I realized the fact of no longer having a family. My mom has a really rare type of cancer, my dad abandoned us when I was 1 year old, so I don't know anything about him. 

I haven't graduated college yet, I work to sustain myself, pay rent and food, while trying to finish my career and get my degree. But, my extended relatives who used to support me financially (since my mom never did it) insulted me for not spengind New Year's Eve with them. I got to live in another city because of my studies, and I am glad because I don't live with them anymore. 

I didn't do it for the sake of my mental health, I constantly get verbally and physically abused by those relatives and that has been like that since I was born. My aunt even tried to kill me. 
They didn't care about my depression, anxiety or suicide attempts. 
Depression started for me since I was 12, today I am 22. I have battling with disease alone, no meds, got therapy just twice because I couldn't afford more, but still they say I have no right to complain since ""they had horrible childhoods and I didn't have to sell anything on the streets"". 

I am really scared because I am afraid of losing my job and I don't want them to hurt me. I don't know what to do if I lose my job, I don't have close friends and my boyfriend is poor and still lives with his parents

This is a direct continuation of the last part. My therapist and I were still getting to know one another and were communicating primarily through messages, as I wasn't really comfortable with more. Once we began having actual sessions, there will be bits and pieces missing that I really can't account for too well.



&gt;  Hello ///// - Thank you for openly sharing your views about yourself, your beliefs and the relational history and status with your siblings. This could not have been easy, yet you did it. I wonder if the traumatic experiences you had made survival possible only if you were able to believe that you didn't matter. It's interesting because the very thing that you want to be able to give your partner is locked away even from you. I also wonder if doing things for the benefit of others is protective for you because it keeps you from expecting anything, thus never again being let down.

&gt; ///// - I know that you talked about not having faith in yourself or believing in yourself, because if you did you would have done ""more than you have"". Your honesty and the truth as you see it is welcomed and valued in this space. Have you ever had the experience of losing something, beginning to look for it and then finding something else that was previously lost? Perhaps this is what will occur for you on this journey. It doesn't matter WHY you are here , only that YOU ARE and that you are WILLING to consider multiple perspectives on what may be going on inside of you that is impacting your symptoms, relationships and view of self. I have a suspicion that you are actually willing , you just need a good, sturdy, yet flexible and toxic free bridge to hope. This IS your time /////. This may be what you have been waiting for all of your life. Remember, the journey of a thousand miles, begins with ONE step.

*Hello, //////.*

*I don't know about it not being easy. For the people I actually trust, it is easy to divulge basically every thing. For those I don't, they will never know me. But I understand that it is vital to this particular relationship to forgo any subterfuge. If I had mattered to those who wronged me, they would not have done so. If I had mattered to myself, I would not have let those things happen. To say I was a child and knew no better stopped being a legitimate excuse when I turned 18. After that point, it's just been me fucking up without excuse. I know better, and I still keep fucking up. I don't know how to break myself from the cycle.*

*I don't know if I agree with that last bit, because, even though my interest or intent may not be for my own benefit, I do expect to occasionally result in theirs. To make them happier, to make their life better, to earn a place in it. I have never been successful in the end. That is a crippling kind of failure, feeling let down is an understatement. I am, each and every time. When it comes to my partners, there's nothing I don't try to give, nothing I'm not willing to do. And yet it always seems that I don't actually commit to that, I always let THEM down. And then myself when that relationship crumbles. It is no less devastating each time it happens.*

*I... Don't really know if I'd had that particular experience, no. I don't think I've ever really been 'looking' for anything, besides a relationship I can count on. I have stumbled blindly into and out of every relationship, every hobby or interest, every place I've ever been. I have never had a plan. I have always just winged it and saw how it turned out. The answer is, never really any good.*

*I believe that to say you want something is fine, but to not follow up is proof that you do not actually want that thing. To say, ""I wanna go there"" and then NOT go there makes you a liar. If you really wanted it, wouldn't you have done it? If I really wanted to be in better shape, wouldn't I have done it by now? No, I just don't want to do it badly enough. This is the first and only time I've tried to follow through, and even then, I do not think it may actually benefit my current reason to do so. I think I may have damaged my relationship to the point it cannot be fixed.*

*I'm more than open to other perspectives. For what it's worth, I know you're not wrong. I know the things you're saying are true. At least, the locked away part. The believing in myself, waiting for my time. I know you're not wrong in those things. I just can't believe in them, myself. I wish I could, but something keeps me from doing it. All that cliche crap about ""where there's a will there's a way"" and never giving up, some part of me really wants to believe it because I know it's a way out of this. I just don't know how to do that.*

*I tend to ramble, by the way.*

"Here is how pathetic I am. I am a 35 year old man (though I use that term loosely as I am pretty much a shitty example of one) and I have to post my problems to Reddit because I have no where else to turn to. I'll  give you the highlights. 

I have no friends and have always been the guy in the periphery of groups of friends. 

I was miserable in high school, probably had add or somethign. I was miserable in college and went to a shitty open enrollment commuter shool. 

I'm college I got my gf pregnant after dating her for two months.  She only wanted to work part time as a cashier despite the fact she has a nursing degree. I wanted to get my PhD as I was a liberal arts major and that was the only way to get a job. But I had to quit  that as I had to work two jobs (one full time) to support my new family. 

My only child doesn't even have my last name as my in laws have, over the last decade, tried to convince my wife I am going to walk out on the family. I have always sacrificed everything for them.

Despite a decade of working my ass off and sleepless nights I make less than 50k a year.


My wife developed depression and anxiety and was suicidal, she is now on meds. 

My wife also is infertile and we can never have more children, she also can't be intimate as she no longer produces mucous. I haven't had sex in three years and unless I have an affair (like that would even happen...... I'm too much of a loser for any woman to want that) I will never have sex again. 

My child has depression, anxiety, adhd,. He has been kicked out of one school already. Keeping him stable is a daily grind. I also missed most of the childhood moments working all those jobs and trying to do grad school. 

I drive a 13 year old car that just broke down for the third time this winter. 

My father has had several strokes and is 100% bed ridden, I have to help my elderly mother help him daily before I go into my low paying low prestige job. 

I no longer have my youth. 

I had less than $12k to my name. 

The only thing that made life bearable was drinking alone to just make stuff numb. I feel like I want to just give up and do that from here on out. Life is fucking shit, especially compared to where my peers are at in their lives. What is the fuking point. I am a loser in a very way imaginable

"So I've had a rough set of years, probably close to 6 now. Early on I lost loads of weight, lost myself in darkness and music, never had lights on, stayed in my room nearly all the time, slept a tonne and just isolated myself.

I've spoken to people (professionally etc) and tried pills (which I hated and stopped very fast) and I've been forced to hospitalize myself, had a psychosis evaluation, spent hours on the phone with samaritans, heard voices, panic attacks, paranoia, nearly went for CBT, been down a huge road of referrals, sliced and burnt myself, suicidal thoughts invade my head 24/7, lost all my friends, my anxiety hit the roof. Blah blah blah you all know the drill

Over time I have been getting better, little things change and slowly I feel better in myself 

These past few weeks though man I've just felt so okay, not upset at all, no telling myself to throw myself off a bridge, no urge to harm myself (how awfully embarrassing) and just generally been smiling a bit more

Thing is I don't want to feel better I think..? Now I have no reason to be my boring as fuck self. That's just who I am, a boring lonley gross waste of space. You know when you can feel a massive load of tears just behind your face waiting to come out at any second? I've had that for a while now, both a mixture of happiness and sadness

My parents and boyfriend push me to keep going and to try everyday to be happy but I just canât fucking do it anymore. They donât understand how hard it is. I just want it to go away. I donât want to study and have a good job, I donât want to live. No life will ever make up for the pain I feel.

"Hi, I am a 19 year old man, so I am still a teenager who probably understands very little about life. Even so, lately I have felt terribly depressed for the reasons I will make known a little later. Before, I used to be a very happy person, I had a girlfriend with whom we were about to be 3 years together. She was also my best friend, we did everything together and she did not need anyone else (besides, i did not have anyone else, but that did not matter to me, while she stands with me, i didn't need any friends). The thing is that at one point we broke, at first I was very affectionate, but I ""got over it"" quickly and I felt pretty good. The problems came when I realized that I did not know how to relate to almost anyone, I did not know who to turn to constantly as a friend, not as an acquaintance whom I only see at some parties. At first I did not take much importance, because despite not having friends, I used to go out at night quite often with different people. I went from group to group, everything was super intermittent, I did not stay with anyone constantly because I was not sure how to do it. Then, I reached a point where I started to get depressed slightly from time to time, like when I was alone in my house or went out to do everyday tasks, the fact of being alone and realizing it depressed me . Although I felt bad, it was not something that happened to me often (About 3 days a week more or less), but with time it became constant, I began to despair because I did not have anyone by my side. I tryed to make friends , but they all went away in the passing of days. So, I also began to feel as if people hated me, as if nobody wanted me and preferred to get away from me, as if I were a bloodthirsty. At this moment I do not know what to do, I have many suicidal thoughts, I do not want to get up in the mornings, I do not even go out, I stay in my house locked up doing nothing. The thing is that I do not know how to make friends, and that's killing me, loneliness is getting worse. I've really tried a lot of ways to make friends, but they all end up leaving me and that only makes things worse as I said before. I want to ask for your help, I want to know how you can make friends (Because i really have no idea how to), how to avoid this loneliness, how I want to go out and stop thinking about committing suicide, but most importatly, how to make friends, i feel like that's all i need. Thanks to those who came here, I appreciate your time and interest.

"Quick background... 4 year relationship ended about two months ago. Madly depressed because of it. 

Irresponsible of me to say that I was not taking my antidepressants until recently. But I can feel myself getting worse. Lately i have struggled with holding conversations. Today I could not leave my bed. I have started searching for a therapist.

"Ive always been denying that I might have depression and thinking im stronger than that.. But lately Ive been feeling so miserable.

Itâs so hard for me to express what im feeling and ive tried talking to professionals (in my school) and when im talking to them I dont feel what I feel when im alone so they dont understand, not saying i understand either because i dont know whats wrong with me or why i feel like this.

"Iâm 14 and I just lost my virginity, I felt unbelievable. I was so happy. Morning came along when me and her had sobered up.

"This world is so funny... it really is..

People swear they are there for you. They say ""I'm here for you if you ever need me!"" but then when you need them, they don't answer your calls, they don't answer your messages, they blatantly ignore you. It takes back all the sincerity of the gesture to be there for you..

I've thought about my own suicide more than once. Actually saying more than once is a bit of an understatement. I think of it every day. Many times a day. When I wake up in the morning, when I get into the shower (if I feel well enough to take one), when I walk outside, while I'm driving.. suicide is a constant thought in my life.

I know exactly how it would go too.. 

1. People would say they never saw it coming.
Oh, really? You never saw it coming? You didn't see my posts on facebook about how lonely I was? You never saw me asking if anyone wanted to hang out? You never saw my poetry that I posted about depression and my dark thoughts? You don't remember all the times I swallowed pills or tried to hang myself and had to be hospitalized? Is that all a blur to you?

2. People will post comments on my social media about how close we were, how much this hurts them... but truth is, they only do it for the likes. I can honestly tell you that I have 2 friends. I'm not kidding. 2. And anyone who says they miss me and love me or that they were there for me.. Its all a lie. People become so fake when someone commits suicide.
They take the death of someone and turn it into something that will give them social media fame, likes, comments. They're addicted to the attention and no regard to the life that has been taken by dark thoughts. 

3. No one will talk about the suicide part. Oh, it's just too sad. It's just too soon. They never want to acknowledge that suicide is REAL. 

4. They will forget me. After all the social media comments and all the posts saying ""RIP Angel"".. a few months will go by,maybe a year or two and then all of a sudden, I'm just a name. A name on a list of those that lost it. They finally reached the breaking point.

I'm writing this in case anyone tries to say that they loved me or that they were there for me.. because if they did, if they REALLY loved me, I would get a reply. I wouldn't be sitting on the bathroom floor crying my eyes out. They would answer their phone. I would have someone to talk to. But right now as I write this, I am alone. I don't matter to a soul now and I won't when I'm gone either. After a few years I will eventually be completely forgotten.

"I have decided to do myself a favour and clean my room. 
These past years have not been very good to me. 

Towards the beginning of the month I moved into this room.
My best friend hasn't talked to me since I moved out from where she lives.
My shrink hasn't talked to me in 2~ weeks even though I've been trying to set up an appointment with her.
I tripped acid on the 26th and basically was in a state of panic for 24~ hours and got taken advantage of by my sisters friends (my sister is a good person, but often doesn't see the bad in people).

It's been rough but I at least owe myself this one thing. 
Sorry if this sounds like a pity party for myself but I just wanted to try and have someone that I need to report to. That seems to be the only way that I can get anything that I want to do done is if there is pressure on me. It's the only reason I applied for my last job.

"Prepare for a long read: 

Im only 15 years old so in comparison to most of you i probably have had it easy but i just need to tell my story for some advice because ive been feeling like shit. So lets start off with my past; my parents got divorced when i was 4 years old than my mother got married to another woman and my father also got married again. I went to my fathers house every weekend so i didnt really miss him but when the years went on that changed into 3 hours a week and i really hated the fact i couldnt really be around him. Then in the following 5 years my grandparents died which ofcourse sucked but i never really cried and just put all the emotions aside. When i was 10 my mother woke me up, she was crying and told me that my father killed himself lastnight. He called the day before but i didnt get to speak to him because i was playing in the garden with a friend and whatever i would go to him 2 days later. I cried for probably 5 minutes and then again i put aside my emotions. Also at his funeral i barely cried and it felt terrible but i just wasnt able to cry. Since that day everything went downhill and ive never really been happy. My mother told us that she felt like a man and she got an operation and now looks like a man as well. She and my stepmother than used a spermdonor to get my stepmom pregnant and i got a little sister at the age of 12. I never really talk with anyone about my situation so everyone just assumes that my mother is my dad and my stepmom my mother and ofcourse i cant blame them. Im a very shy, anxious and introvert person. I also aint that good looking but im very smart (i skipped a year and follow the highest possible level of education) and a lot of people say im funny so thats the only thing im confident about. I used to have some really good friends and as a group we were pretty close but then i skipped the year and went to a different class and the contact just stopped and i was alone. Looking back i think skipping the year was one of the things that fucked me up big time because i went from multiple good friends to no friends at all. I never got out of the house and never really talked with anyone. Then i went to high school(idk what its called but you go there when youre +-12 y/o) and one guy of my old class went to that school aswell so we kinda became friends but that died of really fast aswell. Since im pretty ugly and shy there has never really been a girl in my live that really talked to me or cared about me. But 1.5 years ago this girl from school randomly started to text me and it didnt take long till i got feelings for her we went on texting and talking for months and got really close. But eventhough a lot of people told me she liked me i couldnt believe that anyone would ever love me especially since and i never asked her out ot told her how i felt. She isnt really the best looking girl so i didnt really have any competition but she is still far out of my range. I dont want to talk about her too much so i just will sumarise it; went to her sweet 16 where i got drunk, knocked the fuck out and left out of shame in the night. We got close again months later i (unplanned )told her that i always liked her on fucking snapchat and she said she had to think about it. She never answered and im trying to move on and focus on school and work. But i just cant i miss the one friend i always talked to about how i felt and that was always there for me now she just ignored me and broke my heart in pieces. With the stress of school i was already feeling like shit and im really lacking sleep which is making it even worse. Not being able to talk about my emotions with her or anyone else really makes everything worse and my marks and mood are going downwards very fast. I would tell my mother but she has her own problems which she already barleycan handle so that aint an option and i really hate my stepmother so not even gonna bother trying. Especially the last weeks have been tough with last grandmother dying aswell. I didnt even cry when i heard it again i put the emotions aside and now its becoming too much. Christmas and new years eve were terrible and lonely for me since i didnt get invited to anything. Ive really been considering suicide that last few years but those thoughts became more serious last months. Im gonna break sooner or later and then everything will come out and i know it can be the end of me. The last days ive been wondering why i am alive and what my purpose is on this world and if anyone would really miss me when im gone. Any advice on who i can talk about? or how i maybe will feel better? or let the emotions out?",4," parents got divorced, mother got married to another woman, grandparents died, father killed himself, very shy, anxious and introvert, no friends, let the emotions out ,terrible, lonely"

So my ex and I were dating for a while. 2 years this April. Throughout the relationship we both âflirtedâ with other people but never physically cheated. For the past couple months it wasnât working and we mutually decided to call it off New Yearâs Eve. Being in so much pain last night I slept with someone else hoping it would help at least sone of the pain. It didnât. My ex and I spoke on the phone after it while I was driving home and agreed on whatever happened while we were single happened and wanted to talk after a few weeks and maybe give us another shot. The anxiety took over and I told her I slept with someone else and hearing her cry like that broke me even more. She told me thereâs no chance now weâre ever getting back together and itâs done for good. Does she really mean it or is she saying it because sheâs hurt? ,4,"Throughout the relationship we both âflirtedâ with other people but never physically cheated, done for good,"

"All my life Iâve been boring, pathetic, awkward and socially incompetent. Iâm so fucking sick of being the outcast in every situation and just that weird quiet girl. Itâs not like I donât have friends, but thereâs always seemed to be a limit to the extent I can connect with someone. I always end up overthinking every little interaction I have with someone to the point where I fuck it up more than I wouldâve if I had just been myself. And over the years Iâve gotten so caught up in trying to be perfect that eventually Iâve forgotten how to just be me. 

Recently Iâve been talking to some people in my year on instagram. And I guess I developed a sort of âfriendship crushâ on them. They seemed so interesting and they shared and appreciated my outlook. I never really thought Iâd meet someone with the same interests and opinions as me until I started talking to them. 
Something happened today which fucked everything up. They posted a picture of them at a party and I guessed I just realised no matter how much I THINK Iâm connecting with them, thereâs no way of our friendship advancing. Iâve always been an outcast and I always will be and theyâre just as shallow as any of the other popular kids. No matter how much hope I have for finally relating to someone, most likely situation is that itâs all in my head and theyâre just laughing about me behind my back.
Iâm probably hugely over-thinking this but I canât get it out of my head and itâs tearing me apart. I still want to be friends with them but I guess Iâm just realising any hope I had was just pathetic me being oblivious to the fact that they donât have any interest in me.

"My boyfriend of 3 years and I broke up. My first love, my universe, my everything. 
He messaged me on Christmas telling me he still loves me. I told him I loved him too. We met up yesterday for the first time in a couple months. We kissed a bit, my feelings came back more, even though they never really left, and he told me he misses me so much, he looks at pictures of us everyday. That he still wants to marry me one day. Be the father of my children. I say I want this one day too. And that even though I know we're not right for a relationship right now, I love him and we'll still hang out together since he works close to me. He agreed to come back today to see me. He promised. 
I let myself get excited, I waited, I called, he didn't call back. I called him later wondering what was going on, and he says
 ""I'm fucking other girls and they don't need to know I'm talking to you.""
And here I am thinking about us together, waiting for a call, waiting for him to come since I woke up this morning; and that's what he's doing. 
You can think about someone every waking moment and care about them more than anything in the world, and they will shit on you. And crush your soul. And the whole time it could be lies and bullshit, and your feelings could be so real, but the universe is cruel and unforgiving like that.

"Ok so I'm not gonna lie, I'm drunk, its New Year's day, and I have had a lot of time to self reflect lately. I've been off work from a bulging disc injury (I'm an STNA)and one of the biggest things that helps me fight my depression is working.
I've had waaaayyy too much time to just think and dwell on things that don't necessarily have to be resolved but closure would be nice. 
One of which is, I'm the baby of the family...and I fear that I was babied so much that I was never actually punished or told what was right and what was wrong. I feel like my parents just didn't care anymore at that point because my first 3 sisters were exhausting. They just appeased me. Or tried too. 
The second is...was/is my perception of reality messed up, in more ways than I care to type out right now...or is am I just a brat that never learned her lessons...how the hell do I deal with it either way?

"I've never considered I could be depressed, until very recently after speaking to a friend about her depression. 

For most of most of my life, from a teen to 33, I've had bouts of utter sadness/despair where I feel like I'm not good enough or ever will be. 

But it was always in small doses and usually I could be cheered up fairly easily. What helped a lot was looking forward to watching sports, videogames, nice food and time with close friends. It helped, it always helped, but it was fleeting.

Today at 33, I'm married to a gorgeous and wonderful woman. She really is a beauty, and everyone assumes she's a  trophy wife, except for that fact she's an engineer and has a very popular blog.  We have a wonderful flat, envy of many of our friends. We've got adorable dogs.

Our social life is ok, not great (we've moved to a new city and lost touch gradually with old friends), but we're both sociable and usually never spend a week without a social activity with friends. 

I've got a decent career and make twice what someone my age usually gets. My wife and I together earn just over Â£150K/year before taxes.

We travel a lot, workout a lot, eat healthily, socialize, sleep fairly well (at least 7 hours most nights)..........but that crippling sadness still lingers in me.

I find myself sad and withdrawn a lot for no specific reason. 

It's especially bad when I come back to my home country for Christmas and I see everyone I used to be close to seeming so happy and content without a care about me.

Right now, I'm particularly down about how one of my friends has been toward me. I got him a one of kind (took some effort to find it too, had to get in contact with the band's tour manager) amazing item from his favorite band. We weren't able to meet before Christmas, but today I saw him and he opened the gift and showed little to know appreciation, barely looked at it and then was on his phone 90% of the time, barely asked anything about me or my life. Then left in a hurry saying one his friends wanted to catch a movie with him and he didn't wanna be late.

Now that's a specific reason to be sad, but I've been very down recently and maybe it is my self esteem that's low too, but seeing how not just him, but so many people that I thought were important to me, have just ignored me. It hurts.

I didn't mean to rant, it's just my lingering sadness is getting worse.

I'm afraid to tell my wife, she's had mental health issues and is finally getting better and I don't want to set her back or burden her.

"I spent another birthday alone. My 30th. Not that it makes much of a differences since I have spent most days of my life alone. Not even posting in r/viriginityexchange at the last minute in the hopes of a pity fuck worked.

I am unable to pass whatever social filter that allows for normal sexual interactions.

I have laid next to two women naked in their respective beds. Neither time did I believe they were genuinely attracted to me and I am still not sure they were. I missed those opportunities to lose my virginity many years ago. Since then I have become uglier, fatter, and bald. I am so bitter and negative there is no way I will seem attractive to anyone, least of all myself.


I could blame with the conservative and severely orthodox Catholicism that taught me to hate myself and my own sexual urges. Still recovering from this. I could blame the terrible role models of relationships in my life since my parent's and family's' relationships look like stories written by Updike. I could blame my own past. Regrettably, I have to blame my own cowardice. My own hatred of myself  poisoning my veins resulting in endless pity parties and destructive hedonism. 

It doesn't matter what the causes are now. It is too late. If I ever got up the courage to ask someone on a date and by some miracle they agreed, the actual road to sexual or affectionate behavior would be so pitiful and pathetic she would doubtlessly be turned off or just laugh at my inexperience.

I am going to die a virgin and alone. Whether that death is natural or by my own actions I don't know. It won't be today or tomorrow, but the loss of having missed out on so much is unbearable. I am missing out on the essential human connections that our stories, songs, movies, and every aspect of human culture scream as being the most important part of our humanity. I will never what it like to be loved by another human or experience sexual joy.

"My depression comes and goes, for the most part I'm content and happy, I just have a bad day here and there, but that hasn't been the case over the past month or so. I've gotten drunk almost everyday the past few weeks (although I am sober writing this and have no plans to drink tonight,) I've been overeating, and I've cut back on my workouts which has caused me to put on a little weight (although I guess that's pretty normal for people around the hollidays.) 

I've also been overagrresive and snap on the littlest dumb things. I've been destroying my house, putting holes in the wall and kicking doors and cabinets. I've also been waking up in my sleep pissed off from a dream and hitting the wall. I even woke up and headbutted the wall two times in a row which makes me feel like an absolute crazy person.

This kind of behavior is absolutely not fair to my best friend who is always there for me, my dog. It scares the shit out of him, and he doesn't know how to react. It really makes me feel like shit.

The forefront of my depression I think is due to the fact that I'm lonely. I have a good close group of friends, but most of them live hours away, so were just not able to hangout too often. It just sucks having no one to hangout with in my off time. Im also longing for companionship, a relationship, just someone to be with in a romantic manor. Ideally I'd like something serious with a girl. I do get to hangout with a girl every blue moon, and I'm usually elated afterwards and feel happy, but then it goes nowhere which makes me come down pretty hard.

Which as I'm writing this I'm realizing that may be why I'm in this slump. I met this cool girl, we hungout and had a good time, and I let my hopes get up because I thought I might actually have a chance of something happening with her. But in the end it was obvious that she just wasn't that into me. Which is ok, I'm over it, looking back and getting to know her a bit more I realize that we wouldn't have been a good match. I just wish I could find girls to go out with more than once every 6 months.

I'm just really lonely, I want someone to be with so bad. Someone that I can come home to and spend time with, and cuddle, and have sex of course, but all the other stuff is so much better for me. Of course, I know I have deeper seated issues than just loneliness. I also wish I would have accomplished more in life in general by now, being 27 yrs old, but I'm not gonna get into all that.

I'm not suicidal, although I do think about it everyday, and do wonder if it would be easier to just end it all. But there's no way I could go through with it right now. I love my friends, family, and my dog too much and know it would destroy them if I was gone. I do talk about this stuff with my friends and I'm pretty open with them as far as everything I've written here. So I do have a decent support system, but there's only so much they can do.

That being said, I'm not really asking for advice, I know what I need to do to get better and I recognize my problems. I just wanted to put it all into words to see if it made me feel better, and I think it did. Here's too a better year and getting my shit together.

I see why I stay away from social media. I made a decision that probably made him view me as a creep.

I think that people who are depressed can be grouped into two general categories. Those who have been unfortunately mentally wired wrong and those who have experienced some awful trauma or emotional pain. I'm sure for many on this sub it is both. For me it is both. And because of this fact I am uncertain if I can ever recover. I feel as though it is inevitable that I will kill myself. There is a part of me that really doesn't want to; i'm scared. But there are also times that I feel so badly and I just want it to end. Has anyone out there found anything that's helped them?

"I've been depressed for about 7 years now starting when I was 13. I have wanted to kms since then, but never did it because I couldn't bear hurting people who care about me, even though at that point I didn't have many deep connections (cop out?), Now I'm 20, am needed to help my partner's mom make rent, working an internship that was specially made for me, and have been in a relationship for 2.5 years who ""didn't sign up"" for me being depressed but at least knows that I am in a dark place. I want so badly to kill myself. I am so depressed. I feel empty and hopeless and now I can't kill myself because people are actually relying on me now. 

I'm kind of just babbling but this is the only place I feel safe to be honest because I don't want people to treat me like a ticking time bomb. 

Last night (NYE) I got too drunk at a work party and made an ass of myself. I feel like a different person takes over sometimes and makes me feel suicidal and just generally puts me in bad situations in which I make messes upon messes. I look at myself in the mirror and don't even recognize the reflection as my own. I have to consciously fight to remember that I'm real. I get in my head a lot about how everything is subjective and nothing is real and it makes me feel so overwhelmed I could just drop dead.

I feel like I live in a sarcophagus; my face and body is the fancy lid, but inside there's this entire other existence trapped and unable to control anything that happens on the outside. 

I spend so much energy just keeping myself from killing myself that I don't have enough juice to have any sort of discipline. Then when I act without discipline, I feel so guilty and ashamed and it makes me want to kill myself more. 

I've tried to talk to therapists and all of that but no one seems to get it. They just nod their head and tell me it will get better. It hasn't. And it probably won't. I think I am just destined to be sad and eventually kill myself. My depression is so enmeshed in my identity (remember it's been around for most of my emotional development) that I don't even know anything about myself outside of it. It's strange to me that most people to whom I speak about it aren't depressed. It's so normal to me that I am actually shocked by people who don't live in constant despair and darkness. Hmm.

I realize I have to stop doing this, and I tell myself every single time that I wonât do it again, but I always do.

"Hello everyone

as the title says I typed this for a friend, it explains in the text why. I have a history of depression and self harm (not suicidal, just really numb when depressed) which my friend doesn't know much about, but he knows me well so he will relate instantly. 
Trickier thing is that he is really far away (he moved to GB, I am in Germany. He is going through a rough patch himself, just before christmas he got rejected by the first woman he approached after his wife died early 2014. He is mentally stable though and I am sure he'd want to know this, I am just not sure how to tell him really. I can't word this in free speech, I am not a native speaker and I want this to be as clear as can be. I do fear the text might be too much and/or weird? I have no proper judgement anymore...

here the text, I'd appreciate any help. thank you

So, first of all, I donât expect anything from you, I just need to share with someone who I knows me well enough to understand and I need you, as a friend, to know about this in case it will get worse (no worries, this might sound overly dramatic, itâs not that big of a deal for me since I am used to it) 
A few months back I started feeling stressed and burned out without being able to put a finger on why that is since realistically I had less to do than like a year back. I explained it to myself with lack of interaction with others or dull tasks which have to be done over and over or just hormonal crap and took that for the reason why I felt mentally unstable.
I tried to work on it, made sure to get some breaks here and there, was drawing and painting and meeting with people but things didnât get better (which I only realized a few days back)
The first time I was alarmed was when the urge to just run away for a day or two. There I realized for the first time that my mind is not sending the right signals, since I love the boys and xxx and being away wouldnât be nice at all since Iâd miss the kids for sure.
Still thinking it was an overload of work I talked to xxx, telling him all this and asking him for help (like helping out around the house, that kind of help) which he tries to to his best efforts. 
Itâs still not getting better. I had a proper meltdown on my birthday and on second day of christmas, still not releasing fully whatâs going on. This night I couldnât sleep, I went to bed at 11:30, fell asleep close to 1 am and woke up around 2:15 (thank you fitness tracker for the accurate information) The baby woke me and I couldnât fall back asleep although I tried everything that would usually help. So I laid there thinking it all through and then all kinds of bad memories popped up. You know that I have the worst memory and that I am amazing with âforgettingâ things I donât want to remember, though they arenât gone for goodâ¦ 
Not sure why the normal version of me always decides not to find a way to truly process all the stuff so this shitty version of me wouldnât have so much to feed on but thatâs how it is now. I also realized that I have a general numbness when it comes to feeling emotions, I'm never very happy or enjoy things to the fullest, nor am I really sad nor angry or anything, everything is a little muted. That I actually hate and fear the most, becoming numb and empty.
So, this leaves me where I am now. Itâs not unbearable or anything, but I am afraid whereâll lead to eventually. I want to be a good mum and a full functioning personâ¦ 

I think I needed you to know, as I said, in case things go a lot south and Iâd need your support.

"I love rewatching the original trilogy and the sequel trilogy.  I love the speeches and quotes about hope, rebellion, and doing what right. I really love seeing more diversity in the cast of Star Wars, and love how the focus has shifted from magic space wizards to underdog rebels against evil empires

But it feels like the good guys in our world are losing.

Some of people in power of our government and other spheres of influence (like YouTube and the police system) are abusive and act in their own interests, forsaking the poor, the envoirnent, respect and culture, education.

It takes so much to do good yet it takes very little to do bad.  And there seems to be growing presence of âbadâ online and in real life.

Whatever ârebellionâ exists is just a bunch of people who are hurt, anger, scared, maybe even dying or having everything slowly taken away from them.  A homeless man or disabled person losing programs that can help them. An environment damaged beyond all repair.  A victim being blamed for an abusers action. Parents not accepting their children identity.  A brilliant student being deported to another country and having his dreams crushed for the rest of his life because his parents sent him to a safer country without documentation.  We lost to government that trying to brainwash us with âalternate factsâ and âfake newsâ while also normalizing fascism racism abuse and bigotry. We lost to the FFC.

I keep retreating back to Star Wars. I need a han, a luke, a Finn, a Rey, a leia, a resistance or a rebellion....

But it just seems like the people who make up evil empire - the abusers, the gross disrespected, the hate mobs, the uncaring and arrogant politicians- have won on all fronts.

We have no rebellion.  No resistance.  They say not to give into hate - and that love will and has always saved us.

"Apparently, people hate it when others talk about their suffering online. People figure if you're talking about how depressed you are on social media, you must be faking it or looking for attention. A sincere cry for help makes you an ""Attention Whore"" apparently. I hate it when people dismiss others' pain as insincere just because they posted about it on social media, and even going as far as to make jokes about it.
Also, I hate people dismissing others' pain because of their age. I saw a tweet once that was like, ""If you're under 23 and claiming to be depressed, you aren't really depressed. You don't know depression until you're an adult"" or something like that, and that certainly isn't true. I knew two people, one in middle school and one in high school, that were hospitalized for weeks from suicide attempts.

Please, don't assume others are making up their pain ""just for fun"" because more often than not, the person behind the screen is actually suffering. 
That's all. It's nearly 3:00 a.m. where I am and my depression has been hitting me rock hard lately. I figured I'd get around to posting on here sometime.",4,"cry for help, suffering online"

"Recently I got together with my long time on and off close guy friend from high school. We hadn't talked in over half a year because I blocked him due to the fact that I felt he was constantly leading me on. A couple of months ago he found a way to reach out to me and I ended up calling him and we met up. I ended up kissing him, which is not my nature because I would like to wait till marriage to do anything sexual. Kissing is not too much of a big deal for me but it is something special. I began talking to him again and we would hang out and kiss. I had an emotional breakdown in front of him at one point and that is when I realized that I really liked him. I decided it was time for us to have a talk about where our relationship was going because I had many boundaries and he had many expectations that crossed those boundaries. I finally had a talk with him where he didn't take me very seriously and constantly made jokes about sex and how that's what he wanted from me, till I realized he wasn't merely joking, the things he said had a lot of truth to them. I felt very stupid for being so oblivious to the fact that this man that I have known since high school was such a dirt bag. I ended up leaving his car mid conversation because he wasn't taking me seriously and we haven't really talked since. The following day I felt so liberated. I never felt so happy in my entire life. I realized that I deserved much better but the issue is, I never seem to give that to myself. Despite feeling pretty great about my crappy fling ending, I feel like a part of me is upset. I always end up grieving over people who didn't really try with me and for some reason I don't care this time. For some reason, I want him to see what he missed out on. I know he and I are on different wavelengths, I understand that. I just feel like he lost someone who could've given him real love and care, someone who would've fed his mind. He and I clicked, we had nothing in common but we clicked. He has never been involved with a girl like me, someone willing to feed his soul instead of his body. Sometimes he would make fun of me, call me a ""12 year old girl"" because my idea of a relationship doesn't include sex. I feel like nobody will date me because of this matter, though I know I'm beautiful and hold many admirable characteristics. I feel like this is all buzzing in my head and bringing me down. The fact that I am so underappreciated at times. I do it to myself. I wish I could stop.

"Tried a couple of them, and I'll be honest with you: I absolutely dreaded them both. I don't  want to get deep into it, but one of my therapists took time during our session just to talk with someone personal on their cellphone. (Hard to believe, I know.)

I've heard from a few people who have taken therapy say that you have to find the right therapist for you. But hearing that argument convinces me that I'm essentially paying people to listen to me until I find someone that says the right thing to comfort/""save"" me.

I used to struggle HEAVILY with severe anxiety and my parents would belittle it until I was having anxiety attacks and even then they said that therapists were for crazy people (my parents are very traditional and care about what others could say about you). My boyfriend was always there for me even though, at the time, my anxiety wad mainly caused by him (emotionally). He understood and was the only one who could calm me down.  Post emotional shit I was also very depressed because I was disappointed in the person I became. Because morally I'm very black and white and I let my boyfriend fall in my Gray space. And that was new because I've never loved someone like I love him. He is the light of my life and existence no matter how much shit we have been through in the last 3.5y.

I actually go to pretty good school, pretty talented in athletics (football mostly), I donât have very much money like 98% of the other kids in y school, and because of the amount of wealthy kids teachers are always making kids feel guilty for being white, so even tho sell drugs to help pay for myself, my moms rent, bills and tho we live in a violent neighborhood and Iâm part of that crime my mom still tries to tell me Iâm just a preppy kid (cuz of my school I guess, and she doesnât kno where I get the money from) Everyone acts Iâm supposed to feel guilty and get that everyday, Iâm pretty funny guy and really talented football player but like I said the rich kids wonât have over the broke boy but weâll sure be friends with him at school!!

She told me the only reason her and I never dated officially and stayed together was because she couldn't handle long distance relationships. but yet this dickhead is farther away than I was.

"Hi all.
This is my first post on reddit even though I've used it for quite a long time and I haven't even made a single comment, either. The reason for that is because I've got severe cyber anxiety (scientifically discovered yet or not). Despite having many ideas and experiences to share online, the fear of being attacked, mocked, insulted or looked down prevents me every time. Like many of people here, I've also got social anxiety and depression, accompanied with a naturally boring personality, which make it nearly impossible for me to make friends and maintain relationship. In my secondary and high school, I used to have a number of close friends who valued me, wished me a happy birthday every year and even gave me small birthday presents but not anymore since I went to college and suffered from depression for the first time. I didn't contact them anymore so they probably thought I lost interest in them and let me go too, while it was just my depression which kept me from maintaining relationship in my life. Throughout these years, I've only got groupwork mates, fake friends (been bullied and stabbed in the back by them) and some regular acquaintances, all of whom don't care to be my close friends inspite of my kindness and will to be friends with them. Yesterday was my birthday and I planned to turn the internet off that day because I didn't want to stare at the truth that no one would care about me, no one would wish me a happy birthday although they all got notification of it on SNS. Today, I turned on the internet trying to trick myself that today was just another regular day, no birthday ever happened in order to hurt less but it was in vain. Like previous years, no notifications of any birthday wishes from anyone, even one college friend who treats me quite well (but he probably doesn't consider me a worthy friend, which I've felt so far).
I'm not the type to show my misfortune and vulnerability to anyone beside my parents because I'm really scared to be laughed at or attacked, it took me much of my courage to share it here for I couldn't keep it in my chest any longer. I didn't intend to make it this long at first. I have longed for someone's empathy even if it comes from a stranger on the internet because I need to feel that I'm still connected with the world, to feel that someone still considers me a human being with the need of being cared for, not an unworthy person for anyone to give a sht like I've been. Although I have wanted to take my life and nearly attempted to do it many times, I couldn't do it because I've still got my parents who love me. Maybe in the future after they've left me, I might do it but not now, so I need a reason to keep going.",4,"College, suffered , cyber anxiety, misfortune, vulnerability scared to be laughed at or attacked"

That something being music, specifically Metal and Dungeon Synth. I've also gathered a bit of energy and motivation and can hopefully use that to lose weight and learn some instruments. Hopefully things stay this way, because I'm still a sad fuck and any little thing can send me back to where I was a couple nights ago.

"Today is my birthday, it's supposed to be happy, I'm supposed to be happy. But thing didn't go well in my family, everyone was shouting and blaming each others, then my dad blamed it on me. I didn't care but tomorrow I have finals, I'm already stressed out enough. I wanted to go to a library or a coffee shop to study and forget all about this shit, but then my dad pointed at me and said that if I dared to go out I'm out forever. My mom told me to go my room (she's with me, she cares for me and she doesn't want me get hurt). So I went to my room. Inside, I still heard my dad blaming me for the nuisance I didn't ask for. I grabbed my phone and typed ""Thank you"" to all the texts my friends sent me to wish me a happy birthday. I tried to keep myself positive. 
But then the feelings just hit me hard. It was like a switch. The second after that, I already felt the water all over my face as I threw the glass on the floor. 
I felt...satisfied. The inside of me screamed ""Yes, you did it!"". I played safe with all my life, as the sweet little girl I was. But I know my emotions are unstable and my mental is crumble as hell. I never had the gut to do that, I've always swallowed all the hatred and sadness. So this time instead of crying and writing down all the sadness, I actually did something to show it. Of course my parents went to my room immediately. My mom didn't say much but my dad kept saying how disappointed he was. My dad had a perfect picture of a standard family which the females are always gentle and never fight back. So this incident must make him consider me a failure or something like that.
As I cleaned the mess, he just kept talking. Now he blamed it on my mom that she didn't raise me as a good obedient girl. It made me feel maybe I shouldn't have been born at all. I couldn't tell him that before I'm a girl, his daughter, I am a human. I have emotions. I'm not some doll to bend for his liking. 
I love my dad, I know he love me back too. But the difference between the ideal daughter of him and the actual me is miles away.  
I felt like because of the relationship between me and my family I'm living like a switch. I lost interest in living, I don't see the point of moving on. After all, my life will be a boring cycle. I'm scared that someday I will be crazy enough to actually end my life since I always have that thought at the back of my head. Today I already made the first step. I'm constantly pushed and pulled between living a normal life and depression. 
Tomorrow will be very awkward and stiff, I don't know how to face my family and tell them that I'm really crazy and dead inside.
Maybe I'm truly not suitable for living. For all the achievements and love I get, I still feel so empty. Nothing matters. I love some Kpop idols to learn to love someone wholeheartedly and think that they would love me back. It soothes my poor soul and I have someone to think of instead of thinking about my life.

A year later however, I became somewhat a popular kid in school.  Having friends and being the center of attention stopped my depression. 

However, a string of events happened where most of my friends left me to rot alone. And for the last 3 years, I find myself having no friends. Most of my old ""best mates"" pretend we never knew each other in the first place. Everyone who I loved don't care about me.

"On New Years Eve, I was so convinced that I was going to spend it alone. And I was going to end my meaningless life on new year. 

I ended up spending it with my boyfriend, who made me realised that I was actually cared for, and loved, and gave me a chance at believing that I would have a future in front of me. Letting someone be the reason for me to live isn't going to be good in the long run, but as for now, it's good enough. I actually want to stick around and see what happens. Maybe it's going to turn out fine, and not as bad as my thoughts were telling me. 

He held my face and made me look into his eyes. He whispered that he loves me and didn't want me to leave. He said that he will never ever find anyone else. I don't know why or how, but it was as if he knew what was going through my head. I never told him my plans after all. I felt bad and wanted to cry. He made me promise that I am never going to leave him alone. He knew. He is a precious and beautiful person. I cant bear ever breaking his heart and destroying his life. I've decided that I'm going to try my hardest to commit to having a good life with him. I just don't want to pass my suffering onto anyone. I know what that's like.

"2017 was a terrible year. I dealt with a horrible breakup. Depression and anxiety symptoms that had been held in check for a while became really bad. I lost a friend to suicide. I had my closest friends move away. I had physical health issues to deal with. I had some troubles at work.

The worst part of the year was that my dog got sick twice, and the second time was cancer. Like a lot of people, my dog has helped me through some really tough times. She's been the only reason I've gotten out of bed some days. I've had her for over 11 years. Six months ago she had some aggressive and expensive surgery to treat the cancer and it (seemingly) worked. She recovered well and is back to being her old high-energy self. The last couple of months I have felt so much better because she has too. 

Last week I found a lump on the site of her surgery. I'm waiting to see a specialist, but I'm devastated. If the cancer has returned I don't know if it will be treatable this time. I don't know if I can afford more surgery.

I'm not stupid - my dog is 11, and I know realistically she will only be around another couple of years at best. But I can't imagine life without her, especially now. I don't know how to handle her being sick again and potentially suffering. I can't handle her dying. I can't handle her being gone.

If you're not a pet person, you probably don't understand this, but for 11 years I've always had at least one thing that loved me and relied on me. She's kept me going and I don't know what to do without her. Thanks for listening.

**TL;DR: My dog may have cancer again, and I'm afraid of losing her.**

"I am a 21 y/old male currently in my final year of university in the uk however I still live at home. I have been suffering with anxiety and depression since the age of 14/15 due to my upbringing and circumstances.

I was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness which meant at school I always felt different to everyone else and as such have kept my personal life extremely private. Even though I decided to leave the religion at the age of 16, a large number of my family remain in this religion. I've always therefore struggled to live a 'normal' life, and my small circle of friends still have no idea of my past.

Due to this, relationships with girls especially and making new friends is something I always avoid due to fear of them and everyone else finding out about me. Because of this, I've never had a girlfriend. When I keep to myself and get my head down and focus on university work I can usually put the anxiety to one side, however recently I met a girl who I like and she likes me and it's causing me great anxiety and depression again. She's always telling me about how close she is with her family and not only can I not relate, it annoys me I can't be the same.

I think it has a lot to do with me caring about what people think of me too much as I'm aware of people who left the religion in similar circumstance and have normal relationships and seem to not care.

I like this girl yet she's so opposite to me as she's really outgoing and how normal she is makes me scared she'll only think I'm weird when she gets to know me.

Any words of advice or help would be extremely appreciated. Thanks all",4,"due to my upbringing and circumstances, suffering with anxiety and depression since the age of 14/15 "
"PSA: when someone takes their life, the wrong thing to do is reach out to their closest friends asking for explanations surrounding their depression and general mental state. You certainly DO NOT state that you wish the deceased had reached out to their friends. NEWSFLASH: THEY WISH THAT TOO! This is not a time to point fingers, dig for answers, or to share just how much this has hurt you (I'm talking to you -- the people who have met my friend once or twice) -- especially over social media. Depression isn't simple. It is not brought on by having a few bad days at work. It is not remedied by a change of scenery, a phone call, or a quick trip to the doctors. The people who were closest to the deceased are not here to console you. Life is not about you. It is about the people who surround you. It is a time to celebrate the persons life who has passed, reflect inward, and reach out to those who are in your life and ask for what they might need.

"I'm 19, F and I absolutely hate my parents. They are the worst. All my mom does is take out her anger on me and criticize me. She is extremely judgemental in every single aspect that relates to me.

They have told me multiple times that I should grateful because they feed me and provide for my education, like that isn't the responsibility of parents? They make it seem like it's a great and big deal that I'm not abandoned. They treat me like a slave and I get in trouble if I don't do anything they tell me to do.
I honestly hate every single moment I stay at home. My parents and my brother always gang up on me and ruin my mood constantly.
I have seriously considered suicide in the past to get away from this hell and I still live with them. But I have realised that is too easy for them. I don't want to end my life because of some assholes. I'm gonna study my ass off, get a good job enough to allow me to live on my own and never look back again.

"I just had another relationship end and I have no solid internal base, or friendships to fall back on.  I'm alone.  Has anyone gotten through this and genuinely felt like they were okay?
Here's how I feel:

-She broke up with me and said we're romantically incompatible.  How is it that I thought things were okay and she thought they were terrible.

-I'm 28 and have abandonment issues.  I so badly want a relationship but I am starting to wonder if I'm capable of having a healthy one.

-I have this sneaking suspicion that at some point I won't be able to keep going.  I've been so close to quitting several times and have barely pulled myself up but then it's all happened again.

-I am unable to foster healthy relationships with friends or otherwise.  I've been in therapy off and on for years and still can't do it.

"Iâve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression. Iâm on medication. I normally see a therapist but weâve been on a break for the last few months, although weâre restarting today.

I feel like Iâm falling apart internally. I constantly have a pain in my chest from the sadness. Iâve lost all my motivation and have to convince myself to get out of bed. I frequently look through the medicine cabinet and google how much of all the medications i would need to take to overdose. Iâve cut my thigh before and Iâve starting cutting my wrist, but not deep enough to scar.

The only really good thing in my life is my school. I love my teachers and my classmates, and I look forward to going.
I feel miserable at home. I feel bored and unmotivated. I donât want to do anything because nothing sounds like fun. I get really angry with people and then I get really sad that they donât want to be with me.

Iâve started ripping off my toenails and picking at the skin on my feet out of boredom but also because the pain distracts me from everything.

I have passions, I have hopes. I want to start an Etsy store and make crafts. But I feel like it would never work.

Iâm just absolutely miserable right now. But Iâm really good at masking it. I told my mom the other night that I didnât feel safe because I was so sad and she told me Iâd be fine and left the room. I stayed up all night considering sneaking out and jumping off a bridge.

Itâs weird because Iâm able to be stable at school but when I get home I feel like Iâm being suffocated. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist today. I want more help.

"What do you think makes you feel depressed? What makes you feel suicidal? What stops you from attempting it? What do you do to find peace? What keeps you going?

I've had depression for awhile mainly caused by an unstable family/home and never addressing my issues or feelings. One day when I was younger everything just hit me at once, a family member I was close to just up and left, this left me feeling alone, I also met a girl which at the time I couldn't fully comprehend what I felt for her but she was messed up to from family and all I could really do was cry about my life because I never had anyone I could really talk to about what caused me pain. Needlessly to say this relationship didn't last long and damaged me more so I found myself sitting in the floor with a knife thinking if I'm alone and I can't connect to people and I can't process this pain how can I stay here, how do I keep living. Something snapped and I decided I wouldn't kill myself, that I had to live my life regardless because I risked endding my life before happyness came, before seeing what life could bring, i also told myself i was stronger then this so i made the mistake of burying everything and deciding I wouldn't take shot anymore. This worked out for awhile, I found new confidence in myself, I stood up to anyone or anything I needed to, for awhile I felt invincible untouchable. It wasn't until these last few years that everything I buried came back up. It broke me, it zapped me of all my confidence and strength. I never learned to express my feelings and I always had a sense that my problems if expressed to other people were a burden so in turn I died emotionally, I became a poison to my life and the people around me, I damaged good relationships in my life. Being emotionally dead wasn't a fix either so eventually my mind started to wake parts of me up and it made me flip out, it was like waking up from a nightmare where I saw all the damage I did but unlike a nightmare this was reality. I broke down because I saw myself losing everything that held meaning to me in life and in a fit of pain I hurt myself trying to hide from it all and further damaged my relationship. 

Right now I feel like I'm in between my life working out or coming crashing down. I've been dealing with my past issues and I do feel like I'm better mentally then I've been but my emotions still get the best of me. I'm forced on 1 person I want to spend my life with, trying to repair damages, trying to find a way to explain how and what I've felt. I have other points in my life that need attention, ones that if I deal with will bring me closer to this person but I can't not fouces on them, I just want them to see me, understand what I felt, understand it was hard on my too.

Idk where I was going here. I just kinda needed to talk. I guess my point as to what I asked in the beginning is I'm still here living and I don't plan on stopping because I feel like I can achieve what I want but not if I take my life. Life is going to be hard, harder for some them other's but I'm still going to try for happiness and I'm still going to try to make life happy for the one I love whom I hurt emotionally without meaning to.",4,had depression for awhile mainly caused by an unstable family/home and never addressing my issues or feelings

"i just really need to get this out, i feel so much guilt and shame.

a friend of mine that i was once really close with (and shared romantic feelings and moments with over the years) killed himself two nights ago.

we had a stupid fight late 2015 and it wasn't until mid 2016 we finally apologised to each other and made amends. he had bipolar, he was always very open about it. i struggle with depression and anxiety. when we started talking again, i had not long broken up with a partner and was taking it really hard and trying to cope by abusing drugs and alcohol - i was not in a good place. he was very manic, immediately leaning very heavily on me and wanted to see me. he was also recently heartbroken.

i felt pressure and after our time apart was, in all honesty, thrown off by his intensity and made excuses not to see him. 

we caught up a couple of months later and again, he was very manic. but he was the same person i knew and loved and i was happy to be with him again. however that night we were drinking and popping pills, and we were heavily flirting. after a tender moment he kissed me and he wanted to start things up with me, to 'give us a shot'. telling me how beautiful i was and that we always had a connection etc. i got awkward and avoided him for a while after that. he made attempts to hang out with me and i avoided and made vague excuses.

the next couple of months i culled my social media (i was really weird and anxious about my privacy) and deleted anyone who wasn't in my immediate circle at that time, which included my friend. when he realised, he was hurt and we fought. 

he told me how much he had been struggling, dealing with suicide hotlines... i stood my ground, told him he was too intense... looking out for number one, i forgot to listen and care about my friend who just wanted support and someone to be by his side.

we made plans to hang out at a friends house around 7 months ago. he was, again, manic and abusing his prescription drugs. i was concerned, but mostly irritated at his intensity. we however left with a hug and on good terms.

7 months later he killed himself.

this post is all over the place and doesn't do our relationship justice, i am focusing on the fights we had and the ways i let him down because they are all i can think about. i feel so horrible and guilty. struggling with my own depression, i should have been there for him.

For years I've been trying, I try at work, I try with my friends &amp; I try when I'm on my own. It's exhausting trying with little progress, often regressing back to a state of depression.

I'm so tired of people getting bored of me, sometimes it takes a week, sometimes a month, sometimes a year.

I do genuinely believe they enjoy my company, but when I'm down and want to talk to them they don't want to know. They push me away when I need them most.

I really want a long hug, not just a quick one to say hello or goodbye. Even better to snuggle up in front of a movie with someone and just for an hour or so feel embraced and less broken.

And yet I constantly feel detached from all of this, I get moments where I feel like I am inside this body but not connected to it. I feel distant from all those around me.

Then theres the confidence issue, I've always had some problems with confidence.

"Some background information:

My lowest points were 2014 and 2015. I was 15 and my family moved to another country, but it wasn't what I expected which led me to stay isolated in my apartment for three years. I was too paranoid the people I met at school would see me active on social media and ask me why I haven't been in school. Which also meant I didn't contact my friends back home for a while.

When I visited home it was during the summer and we could only afford to stay two weeks. I tried to do as much as I could in those two weeks which made everything feel rushed.

In 2016, my last year before moving back home, I was in a long distance relationship, it was going great in the beginning but towards the end I could tell something was different and it led me to become obsessive with his activity on social media. We broke up before I moved back home but I found out my friend, who introduced me to my ex, and him liked each other. It did hurt since he was my first boyfriend and I felt worthless and I didn't deserve love because this was the outcome. I also knew they hung out but she was my best friend and I trusted both of them 100%. I have never felt betrayal like that. I wanted support from my friend group but they werenât there for me so I lost them as well. 

I am friends with another girl who is separate from that friend group and she was all I had when I moved back. When I was living away I felt so homesick but now that I was back I didnât feel welcomed. This all happened in May of 2017. 
Making friends has been difficult, I notice Iâve been having trust issues and I donât let people get close easily. But I also crave a connection with people. I also feel left out when I see people I know doing stuff without me. Sometimes I get obsessive of other peopleâs activity on social media and all it does is make me feel worse and I want to stop. I never felt this way before moving so I feel like these are bad habits and patterns I developed while being away.

**Here are my main concerns/tl;dr: I notice myself spacing out a lot and focusing on the past rather than the present, sometimes I check where people are or what theyâre doing via social media but it becomes obsessive, I donât like that I get concerned about other people and care too much about what they think, and I feel like I focus on the negative too much.**

"I experienced intimidation at school, and my story will undoubtedly be different from what you have read in the past.

Because I am psychopathic by definition - diagnosed by few psychiatrists - what I have learned from that encounter will help you see intimidation from a different perspective.


**The story**

When I was younger - in high school - two famous guys from the volleyball team tried to bully me.

They would laugh at anything I would do, and others followed;  most are easily influenced because of a lack of critical ability, after all.

They cursed, started rumors, and shouted insults to make sure the others and I heard them.


**Indifference**

I have learned a lot from these episodes. I have watched them go through all kind of emotions, and it was easy to see they needed to fill a void.

My utter and complete indifference made it worse.  I did not give the attention they were seeking so severely. I witnessed their behaviors toward me without any concerns; I was only interested in learning more about human interactions.

You can learn from every experience in your life, good or bad, only if you take the time - and the required energy - to interpret why the reasons the experiences happened.


**The crowd**

At that time, I expected they would go further with their intimidation - after all, they had not gotten what they wanted; and they did not disappoint.

The larger of the two guys got physical - he had to - words were useless. From my perspective, and judging from his facial expression, it seemed like he pushed me as hard as he possibly could. Then, my back hit the wall, and I fell on the floor right after.

What followed was phenomenal. Everyone that I could see from my vantage point stopped talking. They had that dramatic look in their eyes; they were eager to see how I would react.

Fantastic, because it was a real representation of how limited most humans are. What happened is unquestionably unacceptable in the eyes of the majority of people - and yet - only one person, out of almost fifty, reacted with what looked like genuine empathy.

The rest did not move an inch to help. They watched, anxiously awaiting what was going to happen next. Some out of fear, but the vast majority were just thrilled to witness a possible act of violence.


**You are in control**

What I have learned, and still find useful to this day, is that nearly everyone you encounter in your life is not worth your time, and even less so, your energy. Even if they're not, you need to be respectful with your entourage: it's a necessity to thrive in any society.

You are in control of who you accept in your inner circle; thus you have the courtesy of choosing wisely. From my experience, only one out of fifty should be considered investing your time with.

It was out of the question I would react the way they expected it - I had to see how they would respond if I didn't do anything. Thus, I got back on my feet and continued on my journey.

They didn't cross the line because I still had to learn. I required a code to make sure I could live socially - it is the interpretation of these experiences that would allow me to build its foundations.

That one person who stood out of the group, and who later explained everything to the authorities - made me realize she was worth investing the time.


**You are the strong one**

If you are bullied, feel intimidated, and/or rejected: it is imperative you realize, right now and from now on, you are the strong one. The ones who intimidate you would never be able to withstand - even for a second - what you are going through. 

They are weak, and unlike you, they don't have the strength to control their most elementary feelings. It is fundamental to understand that very few people have the tenacity you possess. You have an attribute that makes everything achievable: self-control.

When you think about it, is there anything else you can control entirely besides yourself?


**The necessity to talk to someone**

It is useless to let these bullies intimidate you one more time. Use your strength, which very few possess, but you do. Remember to talk to someone about it. Take the time to look around you - it is mathematical - there is one person out of 50 in your entourage who will be worth your time, who is willing to listen to what you have to say, and who is going to stand up for you.
It is your responsibility to give that opportunity to that person. Use your strength to talk to someone and share how you feel; you will be surprised how much it will help.

You also have to acknowledge you are not alone. Others feel the same and are enduring the same situation. While all situations are different, inevitably, the solutions are all alike.

To those who intimidate, you are weak, and your actions are only a representation of your lack of confidence in yourself and a clear illustration of how low your self-esteem is.

One good start for you to display real strength - let's face it, you need it - is to apologize. If you still believe that intimidating others is a display of power, try the opposite.


**We want to hear your story**

You are all welcome, whoever and wherever you are, to share how you feel and what's on your mind with all of us, in a place where respect is fundamental.",4,"those who intimidate, you are weak, and your actions are only a representation of your lack of confidence in yourself and a clear illustration of how low your self-esteem is"
"Hi there. 

Iâm a 24 yo lady newly married to my best friend. We rent a nice house, have two great dogs (and a grumpy cat), and I have a steady job that I normally find challenging and rewarding. 

But Iâm still depressed. I canât remember a time when I wasnât. 

My father abused me as a child and Iâve been raped as an adult (before I met my husband). Lately (as in within the last three months), Iâve been experiencing really weird symptoms that are hard to explain. Itâs like my mind is disassociated from my body and Iâm a robot. I see the world through a pane of dirty glass and Iâm not really in control of anything. I see things that arenât there (but I realize isnât reality), like my hands seeming smaller than usual. Iâve googled those symptoms and, surprisingly, depersonalization disorder popped up.

I also have a lot of anxiety (Iâve been previously diagnosed with GAD), and have panic attacks probably three or so times a week. 

I often (daily) have flashbacks of being abused and raped, and am easily triggered by hearing certain words or seeing certain items. I relive those horrors at least once a day. 

My husband knows of my past and is very supportive. I feel so guilty when Iâm not able to get out of bed on my days off of work to do house chores and such, even though he doesnât make me feel that way. He says itâs okay, but he wants me to see a therapist because itâs hard for him to see me like this. 

Iâm working on seeing a therapist, but Iâm very anxious about it. Iâve seen a few therapists before and I feel like they either A) didnât help or B) helped, but talking about my issues brought up a lot of bad memories Iâd forgotten/blocked out. Reliving those memories made me so depressed last year, I was admitted to a psychiatric ward, which was so awful. I donât want to be in a place like that again. 

Lately, Iâve been making huge mistakes at work because of my inability to focus. Iâm trying really hard every day, but I still end up making mistakes. Itâs very frustrating when I see all my effort and hard work isnât enough.

I guess I donât know what Iâm asking. I called a therapist today (after a lot of googling to find one I think I would like) and got her voicemail, but didnât leave one. Iâm just so scared to tell someone these symptoms Iâve been experiencing because they sound so crazy to me. I donât want anyone to think Iâm crazy. And I definitely donât want to be sent back to a psych ward.

"I'm not even close to the same person I used to be. I understand that people change and that's normal/healthy but every step along the way I've just been getting worse. I rarely feel happy anymore, the only emotion I really feel is anger or hatred for anyone and anything. Everything annoys me. Earlier today I was talking with my mom and when she started saying things that pissed me off without even thinking I slammed the box of pills I was fiddling with onto the table, sending them everywhere and stormed off. I immediately felt regret for what I did but I can't just take it back. I don't enjoy hanging out or talking to people anymore, I very rarely have passion for anything anymore and I don't understand why or how I even became this way. This isn't how people are supposed to live, how do I fix my view on the world? I have absolutely no idea what to do, I just feel like I'm in such a dark place mentally. Relationships of any kind are difficult for me because I just don't care about people enough to maintain those relationships. Sorry this is just kind of an outpour of whatever I'm thinking at the time but I'm just genuinely pretty lost as to what I can do to improve my mental state. I don't know what I'm looking to get out of this post, I guess just some advice? Anything really. I'm 20/male &amp; unemployed, I don't know how to drive and my mom can't really teach me so I feel pretty stuck in that regard, I also owe ~$400 to my credit card company because of some debts I couldn't pay when I quit my job at a movie theater for another job (that I already had a start date for) and then something went wrong in their systems and I was out of a job, haven't been able to find one since so that's probably part of why I might feel this way, subconsciously? I also gained a lot of weight in the past few months after losing a lot, from 210lb to almost 160 and I'm pretty sure i'm back to where I started, I want to join the Air Force for a few years to help pay for college but first I need to get fit again which is pretty daunting considering all the weight I just put back on and my unhealthy eating habits. 

Anyway, that's about it. It feels a little better to type it all out but I would appreciate some kind of advice. Throwaway account but I'll be around for the next 2-3 days. Thanks for reading.",4,"Relationships of any kind are difficult for me, just don't care about people enough to maintain those relationships"
"Long story short: In december I talked to my mother about how I feel and that I currently don't get my shit together; Mainly work.
She asked whether it's ok if my family would know (If they asked questions after christmas etc) and I told her it would be ok. First thing she did was going to my aunt and telling her and now my whole family knows and everyone is super protective and sending help, which is exactely what I don't need. When I critizied her, she started the whole ""everything I do is wrong""-bullshit and now even my father called me, who is currently in hospital because of his weak heart and told me I should start using my brain.

While I'm writing this my mother sits crying in the kitchen after she told me that she can't deal with this whole current situation and that I ""don't live alone on this planet"".

"So, there's this podcaster/YouTuber I stumbled upon, and in one of his recent videos, the topic of suicide comes up. In the video, he speaks about all the suicidal messages he recieves from people 
all around the world who listen/watch him. As he goes on, it gets harder for him to talk about it, and it reaches the point where he breaks down, where just describing the messages puts him in tears, as you can tell how much he cares for these people and how much he can empathise with them.

But, I just don't understand it. As much as I try to get it, I can't. Why do people weep for us? Why do they care so much? Why do they spend so much time and resources helping us get better? And with 7.6 billion other happy souls out there, why should one or two lives even matter?

"I'm really into computers and gaming and shit, I have a 4k pc setup that's probably ~$3,000. 250 games, probably about 1,000 movies, 70,000 songs, nice speaker setup, studio headphones, you get the idea. I've loved this shit my entire life and in the last week I've realized that I don't even play games any more. Steam shows 0.0 hours played the last 2 weeks. I don't watch Netflix, I maybe listen to like 10 songs in a day, I used to have it on all the time. I basically just sit on Reddit refreshing the page hoping to see a news article that makes me think for .0001 seconds. 

I've been trying to hang out with my friends who are back in town for the holidays but I'm super fucking negative. All the stuff I would say in a conversation would be tearing down a person or an idea. My ""top 3"" friends leave today, tomorrow, and Friday. I'm gonna be stuck in a room with an entertainment system I don't even want to use. An entertainment system that I built specifically to keep me occupied because nothing else would. 

I thought I was drinking because I didn't care but now I realize I cared about recognizing my indifference. I really don't give a shit now. I was smoking weed whenever I got a chance. I don't even want to be high any more.

Let's just say that I don't think that i'm worth living here. Im tired of my own life. First I'm so ugly and don't tell me that everyone is beautiful because i literally am ugly. A lot of people told me that straight to myself. I care about my health but i can't do anything with my ugly face. Second i'm not good at anything and in school i'm the one to joke about.

"I'm sure this has been answered a million times, but I can't find an answer that fits my specific situation, so wanted to ask myself.  I don't know if I should post this in /suicidewatch because I'm sitting at work thinking about this and won't go home tonight or in the future to try and commit suicide, but I will move it there if people think it's more appropriate there.

I think about suicide a lot. At least once a day but probably more, and it isn't a fleeting though; I dwell on it.  Recently my favorite band lost its lead singer to suicide and when I found out the method, the first thing that came into my head was ""yeah, this is how I'd do it too.""  Yesterday I was driving down the road and couldn't really shake the idea of ""yeah, I could totally just slam my car into this highway median going 90mph,"" and almost felt a physical tension as my conscious mind restrained my arm from turning the wheel.

That being said, I'm not actively suicidal in that I don't want to die, and while I was diagnosed with depression ten years ago when I was a Peace Corps volunteer, it was largely considered a malpractice diagnosis and was situational at best.  

I don't mind being alive, and I have fun with the people I love, do the things I'm interested in doing, have an amazing family who loves me, etc.  A lot of the time I feel happy.  I just get really tired sometimes (a lot), everything seems like a hassle to a degree, and in areas of my life professionally especially, I feel like I'm always coasting on mediocre and feel like I'll always be mediocre / kind of lost in what I'm doing (and if someone feels otherwise and that I'm doing really well, it's because somehow I pulled the wool over their eyes).  I can't concentrate on ANYTHING.  It takes a lot to get me out of the house to do social things, but once I do, I enjoy myself, and I travel a lot.  Life simultaneously seems like it's flying by and like it's creeping along.  

Is this normal?  Is this something I should be worried about? I'm having a hard time even verbalizing this in a way that I feel like makes sense. ",4," It takes a lot to get me out of the house to do social things, but once I do, I enjoy myself,can't concentrate on ANYTHING, "

On the right, is a cute birthday card that my little brother made for me. (Spider-Dan is another nickname of mine) in it, he thanks me for being the best brother he could have and drew a picture of himself and I fighting against a monster whilst I was super saiyan.

Seeing these two items instantly made me burst into tears. I just sat here crying, feeling completely broken. Guilty of the way I feel and how I want to die, knowing I have family that loves me.

I donât ask help from my parents nor do I tell them about my problems because they will simply just say âGet over it. Thatâs nothing.â I find no purpose in anything anymore, I donât see the point in improving myself, I just simply donât find any purpose in living life anymore. I want a GF because I think that having someone to love, someone to comfort and generally someone to just look forward to seeing again will help me out of this hole, and show me that I am not alone and there is someone who will love me back. I tried to get a GF, but each time it has ended the same way, with me being shoved away and them not wanting me. It is ripping me apart mentally. I have given so much to others thinking I would be given the same amount of love back, but that isnât the case. I just want one thing, someone to love because then I know I am not going to be alone for the rest of my life because right now all I think about everyday is the fact that I am alone in all of this. If I canât even have that then what can I have? None of my friends can truly sympathise with me because they simply havenât experienced my pain on this level. Iâm not sure if anyone in the world have experienced what I have. This feeling of loneliness and hopelessness is just killing me inside. I wish I can just quit now and leave early because I donât want to see this game out to the rest of what it has to offer.",4,"want a GF because I think that having someone to love, someone to comfort and generally someone to just look forward to seeing again "
"So that I could see exactly why I'm so repulsive.

I have no idea what it is. I used to just tell myself it's because I'm not super attractive but now I'm getting paranoid I drive people away with some shitty aura that is completely out of my control. This is arguably worse because at least I can work on my physical appearance to a degree.

I try so hard to be there for people, try to be a good friend, etc. But eventually everyone just drops me anyway.

I can't be myself around people because who I really am is a depressed, negative, pessimistic, hopeless, self loathing piece of shit. I can't help it, this is what you become when life and people shit all over you for years on end. So I try to be more positive, but I have to fake it because I'm naturally a depressing downer.

I don't know what it is but people don't seem to ever want to stick around in my life. It seems like everyone just eventually vanishes into thin air and stops talking to me all of a sudden. This goes for relationships but it also applies to some friendships that I mistakenly believed were very close. People don't like the real me but they don't seem to like the fake me either so I have no idea what to do with myself.",4,seems like everyone just eventually vanishes into thin air and stops talking to me all of a sudden
"Itâs like thereâs some fucking hole in me I canât ever permanently fill. I feel like a hollow shell. Sure I can do shit to distract myself from it, but when Iâm alone with my thoughts and nothing else, I just feel so lonely and empty. Distractions temporarily fill up that stupid hole. I can watch TV all day and not think about it too much. I can go out and get drunk. I can listen to music. But the minute the distractions are gone Iâm just stuck with myself, and Iâm just there. Just existing. None of it actually matters; I donât actually have any passion or will to live. Iâm just scraping by and trying to forget about how shitty I feel.

Thereâs one thing Iâve found makes me feel completely fine, if only temporarily; infatuation. I fall head over heels for girls, and I think itâs definitely linked to how shitty I feel. The thing is though Iâm a virgin. All these crushes go unrequited, and they only get worse. In high school they were pretty tame, but since leaving Iâve had 2 massive ones that basically took over my life for their duration, one thatâs still going on right now. The first one the girl wasnât ever really interested in me. She was friendly enough, and we clicked a little, but it was always this forced awkwardness to it. I barely knew her, not really. We never had anything but surface level conversations. It didnât go anywhere at all, but I built the whole thing up so much in my head that it took me months and months to get over her.

Then I became friends with this other girl. Real, genuine friends, which is rare for me. I found someone I have a genuine connection with. It made me feel amazing that Iâm capable of that deep connection. And instead of being able to just enjoy that, my stupid fucking brain makes me fall for her. Sheâs literally my best friend man, and Iâm hopelessly into her. Sheâs the only one I ever open up to, even if itâs just a little. But she has a boyfriend, and while sure we get along great and support each other and shit, I know somewhere deep down she just doesnât see me that way. But it doesnât matter. Cause that holeâs there. And while sheâs in my life, itâs filled. And as pathetic as it sounds, itâs kind of worth the pain of seeing the girl youâre so into being with someone else, because at least Iâm not alone. I have someone to message all day. Someone who cares whether Iâm actually alive. Someone who depends on me. It means the world.

But itâs just not healthy. Itâs a temporary solution to a permanent problem.  The problem is that Iâm just fucking broken somehow. Iâm just empty inside. And even though being around her makes me feel like Iâm someone worth a damn, someone that I could grow to like, really deep down Iâm still hollow man. And seeing her with someone else kills me, just in a different way. But itâs either that or go back to feeling completely alone. And the thing is, no girl wants a guy whoâs this down on himself and lacking in self-confidence.

People always say that you need to love yourself before you can love someone else, but it feels like my flaw as a person is that I canât love myself unless I feel like someone else does. But nobody ever truly does. So I take the closest I can get and cling to it desperately, because if I donât Iâm just alone with myself. Why the fuck am I like this? I feel like my full life Iâm gonna go through this cycle over and over. It just sucks. I hate myself even more for being that asshole whoâs hopelessly into a girl with a boyfriend. I feel like one of those stupid ânice guysâ for even complaining about her not feeling the same. But I just wish that once somebody would feel for me the same way I feel for them. I look for that love thinking it will fix me, but honestly I donât think it would. I donât know how to fix it in all honesty.",4,"pathetic as it sounds, itâs kind of worth the pain of seeing the girl youâre so into being with someone else, because at least Iâm not alone"
"When I was in highschool the same thing, I was kind of happy to be around other people at school but obviously couldnât wait for the day to be over so I could go home. When I would get home I would just feel empty and lonely and sad. I remember when I met my first and only ever girlfriend, My depression literally disappeared the moment I met her. She left me 8 months later and there is a very good chance I will never speak to her again. Itâs been 3 months and I thought I was depressed before I had ever met a girl, but my god, the depression is 10x worse after I had one and she left. Iâm so lonely even sometimes when Iâm with friends Iâm lonely. I canât take this anymore. ",4,She left me 8 months later and there is a very good chance I will never speak to her again
"As the topic says i hate my life, nothing is positive and everthing sucks. My so called friends lie to me, forgets about me. I recently met a woman that i connected with in a way i have never experienced. We talked about everything, both positive things and all the negative things we have experienced. She told me she have never met someone like me and that we got to know each other was ment to for both our sakes. A day ago she told me she dont want anything to do with me.. just my luck. Maybe i am not supposed to live in this world? Seems like what ever i do people just takes a shit on my life and feelings. I am so fcking tired of this happening time after time after fcking time.

tl;dr: People hate me, should i stay alive?",4,day ago she told me she dont want anything to do with me

"~~I apologize if this does not qualify for this subreddit, but I don't know of a better place to talk about this.~~

I never felt like my family truly loved me. They say they do, but all the times that they interact with me feel fake, like they're just pretending to like me for appearances. This is what my gut is telling me, but I don't know if it's reliable.

I wonder if I'm a sociopath. Everyone loves their family, right? So why can't I?

I hate a certain half sister of mine because, growing up, she would always call me names, make fun of me, and just generally treat me like garbage. But anyone I would complain about this to never thought this was anything to complain about. They would be like ""Oh, that's just how sisters are"" and ""Oh, I understand. Me and my siblings fought a lot too, but we still love each other.""

The thing is, I can say with confidence that I DON'T love my sister. At best, I'm indifferent to her. At worst, I want to kill her. But I certainly do not ""love"" her.  I told her this and...it apparently made her cry.

Wait...are you serious? You expected me to love you after the way you've treated me my whole life? Am I crazy to not love being bullied? Am I just weak for not being able to tolerate this so called ""typical sibling banter""??? I need answers, damn it!!

Then there's my father. He's...an asshole. He just is. I really don't feel like getting into how he's an asshole, since I just got through talking about my sister. But anyway...

 Unlike my sister, nobody denies that he's an asshole. However, I am expected to put up with him anyway. Because my father is 71 years old (turning 72 next month), he has been deemed ""a product of his time"" and therefore is allowed to be an asshole because old people are too old to listen and therefore
 I should ""pity him"" because ""he's a lonely old man"". 

But here's the thing: I DO pity him. Of course I do, he's a pathetic human being. But pity =/= tolerate, which is what they're implying when they tell me this. I don't know why they expect me to tolerate this outdated piece of human history when obviously the best option is to throw him in a museum (retirement home) and let him expire. I don't know how I'm an asshole for feeling this way, but I guess I just am.

Those are the main two people that I hate out of this family, but I honestly don't care for any of them. I never felt like I truly belonged in this family. I was always ""the quiet one"" that everyone ignored. I often fantasize about ditching these people and moving to another part of the country, and meet people that I can ""truly connect with"", but of course that'll never happen.  For one, ""truly connecting"" with people would require me to socialize, and I'm as asocial as they come. Two, I'm such an emotionally weak, weak-willed, codependent piece of crap that the very idea of moving away and being all alone is too much for me to bear.  

I'm sure I probably just sound like a whiny spoiled brat to you all.You're probably wondering: If I don't have the guts to ditch them, why don't I just deal with them? Well, they clearly never wanted to deal with me all my life, so why should I?.......................Right?...RIGHT???

I don't know... What am I saying? I don't even know what I want...

Obviously, there's something I don't like about my family, but I don't know what it is, so nothing will ever change...... What if there's actually nothing wrong with them?....What if I'M the problem? What If I'm just a horrible person that will never be satisfied no matter what I do? If I can't be satisfied with what I have, do I just not deserve happiness? I don't know when I became so terrible....Wasn't I always like this? They say no one is born evil, but...look at me....

I'm not sure why I typed all of this out, I doubt anyone will read it...and if you did, sorry for wasting your time...

"My mom is a crazy psychotic bitch who can barely take care of herself. I can't tell you how many times I've overheard my mom talking bad about me to others, calling me weird, a freak, etc. all because, well, I don't know why she doesn't like me. But, a good mother would accept her son any way that he is. My older brother is a narcissistic, arrogant asshole who I can't spend more than 3 minutes talking to before my head wants to explode because he does't actually listen to anything I ever say and still treats me like I'm 10. But guess fucking what? He's the favorite of my family. My grandpa and grandma, though they would never admit, clearly favorite him quite a lot compared to my sister, cousins and myself. Every time I go to a family dinner it's anything but family time because a huge argument always occurs at the table, which causes my grandma or aunt to get upset and cry. I don't know why they always have to argue over something. Also, I'm going to art school in the fall and nobody takes my art passion at all serious because I'm not choosing to follow the same typical conventional path as everyone else and become a lawyer/doctor/teacher or something similar.

"I apologize for the long/whiny post but I need to vent.  Hopefully this helps clear my head so I can get some sleep tonight. 

About a week ago I was talking with a friend (I will call him Derek) and the topic of New Year's came up. I told Derek that I did not have any plans at which point his girlfriend (Kim) suggested that I join them on a trip up north to hang out with her friend (Sara), whom Kim tried to set me up with about a year ago but I was just not in a good place to start dating and within a few weeks she was dating someone else (Ken).  At this time Derek let me know that Kim wanted to set us up again. I recently, about three weeks ago, I got the dreaded ""I just want to be friends"" from another woman that I had been hanging out with for a little over a month.  This made me a little hesitant since it had not been too long since the rejection, but I agreed to go.  The plan was to go up Sunday afternoon, stay the night at Sara's, and leave Monday morning.

Fast forward to the Sunday night and we are at a house part hosted by one of Sara's friends.  It is still early and I find myself talking with Kim at the party, Kim is asking me if I am interested in Sara and I tell her I am.  She gets a huge smile on her face as she was talking with Sara earlier and she was interested in me.  At this point my head is going crazy, I am probably the happiest I have been in years, I start to think finally something good is happening.  Midnight comes around and Sara and I are standing next to each other, the countdown ends and for some reason I cannot pull the trigger and kiss her.  I am an idiot. 

Of course, the party continues and I go outside with Derek to smoke a cigarette (cope) thinking that I blew it with this awesome girl.  We come back in and mingle with the other party-goers.  I find myself talking with Sara alone, we talk for a while and then in the middle of our conversation she leans in a kisses me.  I am back on cloud nine, I didn't screw this up.  It is about 1:00 AM now and we head out as Sara has to be to work at 5:00 AM.  

We get back to Sara's place and start getting ready for bed, I am in Sara's room with her as Kim and Derek climb onto the air mattress in the living room, the original sleeping arrangements were for Kim to sleep in Sara's room on an air mattress and Derek and I were to sleep on a couch and air mattress in the living room.  So there Sara and I are sitting on her bed and we say goodnight, and she looks at the air mattress that was setup on her floor.  I get the hint and climb in, I don't think too much of it as this is the first night that we have really hung out and the fact that she has to wake up in 2.5 hours.

The next morning; Kim, Derek, and I wake up and clean up Saraâs house.  We decide that we should grab some breakfast before heading home, Kim texts Sara to see if she would like us to bring her anything which she does.  It dawns on me that in all of the excitement of the night I never asked Sara for her number, I am determined to get it before leaving.  We get to Saraâs office and head in, she is there with one other coworker.  As we say our goodbyes she hugs me and then as I am about to ask for her number someone says something to her and she looks away.  I lose all the confidence that I had to ask and leave.  

The drive home is hell, all I can think about is how I missed my chance after what was probably the best night off my life in 10 years.  Kim drops Derek and myself off at Derekâs and he asks me why I didnât ask her for her number I tell him that I didnât want to ask in front of her coworker, which is half true.  He says that he will talk to Kim who will in turn talk to Sara and send me her number.  I hate this as it is like I am back in high school but it is the only option I have.  
I do not hear back from Derek on Monday night and my head goes straight to the worse possible reason, Sara wants nothing to do with me.  I talk myself down from that scenario as Derek and I had made plans for Tuesday.  Tuesday comes around and Derek and I hang out, I do not bring up anything with Sara the entire time until it is time to leave.  I ask Derek if Kim had talked to her and he breaks the news; Ken, Saraâs ex, is moving back to town.  This is information that Kim knew prior to inviting me, but she does not want Sara to get back together with Ken so she was hoping that we would hit it off and that she would not want to get back with her ex.  


So now here I am, feeling awful, rejected two times in a month.  How could something be going so right and end so abruptly?  I am not sure if Sara wants to get back together with her ex or as I was told her ex coming back to town is just messing with her head and she doesnât want to get hurt again.  Kim and Derek said that they would talk with her and let me know but now I feel like I shouldnât even try anymore, it always ends the same.",4,"feeling awful, rejected two times in a month"

"I've (31/F) struggled with depression my whole life. Grew up in an abusive home, had abusive relationships, bad marriages, etc..I've even tried committing suicide a couple of times. I've been to therapists for the better part of 30 years, and I've been on every antidepressant they could prescribe, with little positive results. It just doesn't help. I've been pretty okay for the last year or so, though. In fact, I've been happy... I started writing poetry again, and started teaching myself ASL. I felt hopeful for a future. But I've hit a low now that's lower than low. Lower than I've ever been, and my husband has basically told me to either kill myself already, check myself into a ward, or shut  up. I know, it's not exactly the supportive phrase you want to hear when you're already depressed, but there it is. I'm not going to kill myself, that I know. I've got two kids, and I can't. But I find myself with this incredible urge to run away- just disappear and never come back. And I don't want to do that either, because I love my kids. I don't want to die, I just don't want to live anymore, if that makes sense... 
Anyway, I'm going to check myself into a psych ward, but I'm scared. I don't know what to expect. If you've ever been to one, could you please share your experience? What were you there for, how long did you stay, and did it help? Please be kind here. I can't take much more negativity right now. I just need to know what I'm in for. Thank you.

"Been with my boyfriend for a year now, and after getting out of an abusive relationship with my ex of 4 years. 

A lot happened to me, and I'm still trying to cope. Since then, I've been switching medications, weaning off, increasing, etc. My moods are all over the place, and recently I've been crying over everything. 

My boyfriend thinks I'm overreacting and I should move on from the sexual and emotional abuse I experienced for years. He has never understood what it's like to battle depression, and I can't find a way to show him it's more than being ""sad"" over ""stupid"" things that happened in the past. 

Recently, I've been diagnosed with tuberculosis, had to quit my job due to hostile work conditions, can't go back to the medical field now because of the TB, out of money and relying on my parents, I have no friends, can't make friends because everyone around here is an asshole, struggling with weight problems for the first time in my life, still trying to wrap my head around the fact I was raped, and a lot of other issues that just keep piling up. 

I don't know what to do. He doesn't take me seriously, which leads to arguments, which then leads to me crying, and he can't deal with crying. He says I cry too much, I need to stop letting everything bother me. Duh, I'm trying?

"Words cannot describe the emptiness I feel inside. The only emotions I can feel are guilt, self-hatred, anxiety, depression, and regret. I remember when taking a walk on a nice day would be pleasant. Now it's 4Â°F outside and the sun hurts my eyes. I remember when fresh snow used to look so mesmerizing and fragile. But now I look outside my window, see fresh snow and I think ""Fuck this white bullshit. I can't drive my barely working car in this.""  
Not that I would go and drive anywhere anyway. Nobody wants anything to do with me. People at my school see me as a freak, a social outcast. I wear all black most of the time with bandannas and necklaces. Y'know. The ""Dylan Klebold"" type of kid. Might as well carry a TEC-9.
 Nobody ever approaches me, and if they do it's just bullshit small talk or they are forced to talk to me because of some school group assignment. Also, to put it lightly...I'm not very photogenic. I'm 6'2'' 120lb male. Skin and bones. I'm blindingly pale and have a lazy eye, I can thank my dad's genes for that &gt;:[ And every girl I've ever tried to get has gone after the stereotypical football player hottie with big biceps. I've faced nothing but constant rejection. From everyone. From my friends, family, my teachers, and even myself. Hell, even my fucking *mailman* rejects me. My package has been sitting in your office for three days. I might as well walk the 3.4 miles down to the post office and get it my damn self. What the fuck man?

Anyways....I just wanna disappear to a far away tropical island for a few months with nobody but my crush and a fuck load of drugs. But that'll never happen. I've never been able to have what I want. I had a fucked up childhood, witnessed my mother throw a vacuum cleaner at my father when I was 6 years old scared and shaking in the corner. My half sisters always pestered the hell out of me, which I think is part of the reason I can't talk to girls well. 

I've felt depressed since I was about 14. But every year it slowly eats away at you, and here I am at 18 years old. A legal adult who is a hard drug addict, is essentially broke and works minimum wage, spends any/all income on useless bullshit like the newest adidas shoes or the newest video game, or drugs. Mostly drugs. Ive spent thousands on weed, benzos, blow, acid, shrooms, ecstasy, cigarettes, you name it. I've done it. All besides opiates, meth, crack, and that synthetic weed shit that makes people go ballistic. 
I started young too. Took my first hit of weed at 15, tried ecstasy and LSD at 16, coke at 17, and it all went from there. I haven't been sober in years. I've fried my brain. And I can't stop. I'm heavily addicted to benzos and drinking(more so benzos). It's the only thing that stops the nasty thoughts. The pills are the only thing that make my awful thoughts stop. Every day I think of a way I could potentially kill myself. But I've never acted on it. But I'm afraid I might have the balls to do it one of these days and end this constant suffering. My mind is pitch black. The lights are on, but nobody's home. I'm a ghost. I'm a shell of the person I used to be. 

Just wanted to get this off my chest. Any replies are greatly appreciated. But don't ask me to go and seek medical help, I'm already in the process. Sometimes I feel like it's making it worse, considering the USA's healthcare system is fucked.

Do you know what it's like straddling two cultures from opposite sides of the world but being born &amp; raised in another they vehemently love but also resent because of the ""way you turned out""? Do you know what kind of things they say to try to snap you out of it and make you realize what a fucking cushy life you have with too much time on your hands and a nagging desire to want to make other people think you are worse and crazier than you are because you are dramatic and attention seeking, and not even knowing how much of that is actually true or not?

So why the fuck would I care about the loved ones I leave behind. I stopped loving them a long time ago and the entire world couldn't love me enough to make up for me not loving myself at all.

Secretly I do want that. I want someone to love and take care of me. I want someone to love and take care of back. I want all of it and I want it exclusively and I want it all of the time and forever and now. But realistically, it's never going to happen.

"I'm 36 and am having a hard time keeping it together lately. I have two wonderful kids and a supportive wife but I feel depressed so much that the only way out is to just be done with it all. I have battled with depression for years.
I recently was staring to ""feel"" better when I reconnected with my niece this past year. She has been battling bipolar and anxiety for years and I took the challenge to help her we got very close but she had a recent anxiety attack and has isolated herself and won't give me the time of day. It really messed me up emotionally and now I can't manage my head. 
I looked at her as my daughter (she's 17) and i so wanted to help her. Now it's just one more thing that I failed at in life.

"Hello. 16F here. I have been treated for my ADHD with various doses of Vyvanse for the past several years and I currently am prescribed 50 mg.

I abused and misused my medication this summer. Going back to school, I was no longer able to do that and I had to go back to my intended dosage. The adjustment was very difficult, and I completely withdrew from friends, would sleep excessively (5/3pm-6am most nights), and felt very fatigued and indifferent for about a month until I finally got used to being back on that dose. Still not sure if what I was feeling was withdrawal or not

I have never brought this up with my mental health provider in fear of losing her trust and fear of being taken off Vyvanse. 

On December 8th my father died. I had a very difficult relationship with him and a complicated childhood as a whole (alcoholism, parents weren't around, all that stuff). He lived in another country at the time of his passing, so I missed the last weeks of school to be with his family in his home country and I arrived back in the states on Xmas. 

I cannot be around my friends without Vyvanse. I zone out in my own thoughts, I resent them and find no joy in being around them. I feel so disconnected and alone from them, even though they are supportive.  On New Years, I was at a close friends get together and I felt like this and I went to the bathroom and for the first time had intense urges to self-harm. Called home, left the party, and got drunk alone instead.

I feel like I live in these two worlds as who I am medicated and who I am not medicated. Nobody knows the real me because of how different my personality is on Vyvanse, even I donât know the ârealâ me I've been on this drug so long. When I crash from Vyvanse now, I feel like Im in a dark deep hole. When I'm not on Vyvanse, I'm dissatisfied with everyone and everything around me, including myself. the only time I'm happy is when im on amphetamines. 

i cannot sleep anymore and I get about two hours every night. no sex drive at all and I am losing all my friends. I am just so exhausted.

Is this depression? Or just grief? 

Also is it likely my therapist will take me off my adhd meds if she finds out i previously abused them? ",4,"had a very difficult relationship with him and a complicated childhood as a whole (alcoholism, parents weren't around, all that stuff)"
"A close friend of mine, over the internet, told me that she was sorry. This was out of the blue, because the last time we talked we were really happy. I asked what for, and she said she broke a promise.

I didn't understand, but then she said she hurt herself. I asked her why and she said she just did deserve it. I tried my best, but she just ended with ""I'm sorry"". I attempted to convince her, since I have a history with suicide attempts and depression. She said ""I can't promise anything"". She wanted to go offline for a while, so I just wanted to let her know how I felt. 

I told her ""I love you."" and she said ""I love you too"". She isn't single, she's dating my friend, but I have a huge crush on her, and we are really close. It happened 4 hours ago from when I posted this, and I'm extremely concerned what happened. ""I love you too"" is the last thing she said to me. She hasn't said anything since, and I feel extremely depressed because I may have been unable to stop my closest friend from committing suicide.",4,she said she broke a promise.

i once did this to my sister and i only read one post she published in r/BPD about writing her own suicide notes and planning on committing suicide, but she was burning herself and being psychotic and about to commit suicide like I'm not in that place right now but it sure makes me feel worse that my family doesn't trust me.

"I don't know whats wrong with me and I don't know what to do. Ive been depressed my whole life, but its only somewhat recently I've realised its not a nornal thing. I've never really woken up happy to be alive. I either have bad days where I wonder why I bother for a while then get up cause it's ""what I gotta do"" and theres other days where I'm able to function ok. I get happy, but ive never been content about life.

Now Ive started getting crazy paranoia. I'm starting to convince myself that my friends who love me hate me and I can't stop it I know it's all not true but there's these sorta voices in my head that do everything they can to convince me it is and I'm starting to give in. I'm just full of hate and soite and jealousy now and i don't wanna feel like that but I cant help it. 

I fucking hate living like this. I'm so fucking alone and my self hatred runs so deep. Ive had periods where ive looked at myself in the mirror and just gotten so fickimg angry that that piece of shit exists and then i get a sorta feeling of clarity where i go to grab the knife or whatevers at hamd and i just whack it on myself. I don't even cut I'm just shout and whack it on my arm and it leaves deep cuts and then i just cry thinming why did i do that.

I don't wanna live like this I don't really wanna live at all I never hsve but i can't die cause I have family. I'm forced to keep going on in this shit. Everyone hates me and I see why. I'm just an insecurities riddled piece of shit and i trust no one not even the people I'm meant to because my head tells me not to.

"The first time shit started to really hit the fan was 9th and 10th grade. My family had just moved and there was always something to bicker about. I was the only child and I didn't do fairly well in school and waking up early when my body for some odd reason decides to default to sleeping like a backwards human being didn't help either. It was the first time I had heard about all of my symptoms being that of someone with ""depression."" Mental illness is not a universally/well-spoken about topic where my parents came from so naturally came the ""How can you be so lazy, how can you get such bad grades when we're trying so hard to put a plate of food in front of you."" 

Things got worse when I dove into self-harm because at the very least it was some kind of relief. My family doctor found out accidentally while giving me a regular health check up. I was interviewed and I could feel my doctor's spite. The anger resonated with my mother and she reacted in anger saying: ""I don't know why she even does that!"" And came the car ride, ""If you hate your life so much why don't you just die."" 

And I almost believed that she meant that and I spent hours crying on the kitchen floor. My mother is the only person I can usually trust, I felt like what was even the point. 

Before we left the doctor's office I was threatened to go see someone and that there would be an issue if they found out I didn't schedule for one. My mom and I both sat in the car and she bargained with me explaining that if I were to go to a therapist, they'd mark my records as a mentally ill person and that I'd never find a job. 

After that I tried my best to cope with it. But then I broke one day. I was having an argument with my mother and it was the first time ever she had physically smacked me across the face. I was mortified and I broke down in my closet. It was the first time I had felt unable to control my own body. It was then my mother decided to give me a listen to the issues I was going through. 

After I calmed down, I explained to her what depression really was and how it feels and what I can and can't do sometimes. She sympathized with me but I didn't think about therapy after that. I told myself I'd eventually go. 

I'm a 3rd year into college now and it's over break. I'm not feeling the best, but better than I have since the past several months. I want to seek help while I can before I fall into another slump.

"I am 25yr male from India and am living in the US since last year with my parents.

They have always had domestic quarrels and sometimes violence since as far back as I can remember.

This had scarred me for life as I didn't have confidence to talk to any person, I never had a girlfriend nor did I pursue any marriage choices.

I did separate from them for a brief period while I left to train for IT at a different city after my Bachelors.
But then, our immigration case which was pending since more than a decade in backlog was processed and we all migrated to the US.


Here, the tides turned dramatically, at least for my life.

I moved here to study, but I was forced to drop out because my father won't spend any money to care for my ailing mother.

Furthermore, my relatives here abandoned us and even troubled us to the point where they destroyed years of relations and blood lines.

Additionally, I was forced to take job at a crappy place to bear the burden of my Narcissistic Father, my obsessive mother and my innocent young brother.

My Father is more than just frugal but a Miser.
Not caring for his family he buys properties in India while his family suffers here.
He would've killed my mother by not providing her with day to day food and sanitary products had I not abandoned my education and put my hard earned money to provide for her.
He constantly troubles, teases and incites quarrel.
He acts in mischief making my mother shout loud at him and disturb the neighbors.

My mother on the other hand is so obsessive that she sometimes won't even let me sleep alone and would herself sleep on the floor of the room.
She always would be pin pointing at me for trivial stuff.
Would not let me study nor work in solace.

Granted this is an over affection of motherly nature but coupled with my father's mischief is disasterous.

She can argue with him for DAYS (I'm not kidding) on end without even eating a morsel of food.

I can continue for pages but coming to the gist.

My father was doing the same mischief again and my mother called the police on him. Saying that he is abusing(she intended verbal, police assumed physical) the children and her and not letting us live peacefully.

This happened at the end of a shouting session between my parents which all happened in the apartment I leased on my crappy salary from the job I had to take after I had lost all hope in life and no relative or friend would help us.

The police had to write down my name as well as my parents and confirmed that as long as no one physically assaulted anyone they can't do anything.
But if they continue shouting and the police has to come again, they'll take one of my parents away.

Now, I am again scarred to life as I was when I was a kid, a teenager, a young adult and now again.

Country doesn't matter, relations don't matter, dreams and aspirations don't matter to my parents.

They are narcissistic and obsessive fools.

Despite being a University topper and despite being a top notch Computer Programmer, I couldn't fulfill my dream, I couldn't study for my Masters and I couldn't prepare myself and work for a good company.

They have now spoiler my life again and possibly for the last time.

Now I wish they would just leave me alone and be off on their ways.",4,"they continue shouting and the police has to come again, they'll take one of my parents away"
"Hi, I'm in my senior year in high school, and I need help with my girlfriend. While I currently do not have depression, she does. One thing that worries me the most is her pessimism. Sometimes, there will be a situation that she is not looking forward to (for example, she is getting her wisdom teeth out tomorrow), and she gets incredibly down and grumpy about the situation. I have told her that it will be ok and that I'm here for her, but she continues to rebut with ""I'm being logical and I'm correct that it will suck"". How do I help her? Obviously she is right and it will suck (I've gotten my wisdom teeth out so I'm definitely aware of the pain), but she still gets really depressed and pessimistic about everything. What do I say? I've already introduced the idea of therapy and she definitely did not like that, so as of now, I'm at a loss as to what to do. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

"I'm a twenty year old who still lives with his parents and is going to college. I had been thinking about things recently, namely about how bad my depression has gotten, and I decided I'm tired of feeling this way and I wanted to do something about it. I decided I needed a change, and wanted to finally move out. I went to my family and decided to tell them my plan to move out which they thought I definitely should not do that way I could finish college. While we were having the conversation I began to tear up and my stepmom (who is like a second mother to me) asked me why I was getting emotional about it. I didn't really know why I was but I decided that I couldn't really hide it anymore. I told my parents I was depressed and suicidal and they both began crying. This was a shock to me because I have always felt as if I was more of a drain on them than anything else. It was extra surprising because I had never seen my dad cry, over anything, and I truthfully thought my dad was ashamed to have me as a son. They began telling me how much they loved me, and my dad even told me that he was proud of the man I've become, and I found out that my stepmom struggles with depression as well, and has taken medication for it and says she feels a lot better because of it. We're going to plan a doctors appointment for me and see if medication can do something to help me, because I'm doing a really shitty job of managing it now. I just wanted to post this to really share the experience with you guys, because it has honestly changed my whole world. I had been going through life, day by day, feeling like I was a parasite, feeling unloved, feeling ashamed to be who I am, but now after talking to them I feel a lot better, I feel like I may be able to finally fight this. Please excuse any grammar or spelling errors, I'm writing this in tears, but if you're struggling with depression, and feel alone, and feel like medication isn't for you, maybe you should just open up to someone close to you about your depression. I can't say that your experience will be the same as mine, I don't know anyone else's situation, but what I can tell you is that opening up to them, and finally telling someone ""I am depressed"" made me feel a lot better.

I love too much and it's hurting me because they don't love me or care for me back. It's not romantic wise. It's just one of those genuine friendship types.

They distance themselves away from me because they know that's what's best for our relationship 

It's all my fault I ruined our friendship. I put too much care into them. I bought them a lot of things to show how much I care. But I messed up. I messed up big time. I was living in denial the whole time.

I found out they only still care about me because they're a good person. Not because I'm something. I was such an idiot. I was the asshole beachside I kept expecting something in return from them. 

And I can't stop caring about them. I want to isolate myself from them for good, because they don't deserve someone like me at all. All I did was hurt. 

I easily get jealous when they give care and attention to someone else.

My god, I'm just really sad and heartbroken at this point. Just a depressed teen here, crying hot tears in bed, and listening to chill hop. I am nothing but a horrible piece of shit.

"I just turned 20 in mid December, I donât have a job, I donât go to school and my girlfriend (of two years) that told me she wanted to be together forever and even shared a dog with me has been ignoring me since Thanksgiving. I caught her getting almost daily voicemails left on her phone by a guy I was clear I wasnât okay with the flirting with. Today I got a text out of the blue saying She wants to meet in person this week to âmove onâ. Every part of me still wants to be with her and it kills me to think of a life without her; especially after going as far as planning our futures together. I thought the holidays were going to be the worst of it, but Iâm slowly realizing that when everyone is getting back into their routines Iâm still stuck. I want to get a job and go to school and be successful, but I feel trapped in this dark pit. I really donât want to live anymore and the only thing keeping me from killing my self is the pain and disarray I would cause my Mom and Dad. I see a psychiatrist and take antidepressants daily; I have since I was 13. I donât want to open myself up completely to my therapist because of my fears of being shipped to a mental health hospital. My parents in the past have seriously suggested that I stay in one. I donât know itâs hard to believe you can live a normal life or be normal after youâve been locked in a psych ward.",4," my girlfriend (of two years) that told me she wanted to be together forever and even shared a dog with me has been ignoring me since Thanksgiving,donât go to school "
Last year I had some of the darkest moments in my life. Iâve been reflecting over those moments the last few weeks and I have finally accepted the fact I need help. Iâve always thought I could do things on my own and I didnât need anyoneâs help. However last year showed me I can win battles on my own but Iâll never win the war without people supporting me. So I decided to try to let people into my life this year and let them help me when they offer it. Also I just want to try to be more social in general.  To start out I decided to make a Facebook account since people always seem to ask me that and I always say I donât have one. Ironically when I tried signing up it said my name wasnât real. Haha can you believe it oh god truly has a sense of humor. Anyway as soon as I got there I started seeing my friends accounts and their friends and even though I knew some these people for some reason I got the feeling I always get when Iâm around a lot of people. The feeling of not belonging. I hate this feeling and itâs probably because I spent so much time isolates from other people but I never seem to feel like I fit in even with friends. I look at the whole thing and itâs just not for me. Itâs like these people are happy they have lives they care about others. They put themselves out on the internet for everyone to see where as Iâm a more personal type of guy. They are normal human beings and at times I honestly question wether I even am human. Anyway itâs weird just wanted to put this out there. ,4,decided to try to let people into my life this year and let them help me when they offer it

I donât want to start over again telling people about myself, telling stories, explaining how I think, and all of those things you naturally do when you know someone for years. 
Itâs not even just loneliness, itâs a feeling of dread knowing that youâre going to have to go through the same things that you did with the people who have hurt you to try and feel like you mean something all over again.

But the extreme selfishness wore me quickly. 'I'm so depressed, I'm going to bitch at you and you're gonna just have to take it.'

Well, I'm starting to think I might not be a terrible scum of Earth as I used to think, because I don't wanna do that to others.

"Hi, 

I am no stranger to depression my self but am having a lot of current difficulties with helping my wife through hers. As I'm sure your all know what works for one person may not work for the next. Nor is it easy to know exactly what will help the best, especially when the depression hinders the sufferer from understanding their own needs, being able to express them and sometimes even not being able to accept the help even if it is exactly what they were asking for.

I love my wife deeply and would love to help her in any way that I can. I think I need a bit of a different perspective on this. Is there anyone out there that is willing to share what works for them as ""depressies"" or caregivers.",4,love my wife deeply and would love to help her in any way that I can
"It's weird because in middle school, I had friends. I attended a different high school than the rest of my friends, so I talked to them less. I started having social anxiety problems around this time as well. Most of my friends started experimenting with drugs and alcohol, but I knew that wasn't for me. Still my social anxiety made me think that because I was different than them in that way, they wouldn't like me as much. I was also scared they'd pressure me into doing it with them. So I started to socially isolate myself. I'm in college now, and I really don't talk to anyone besides my family. I have two people I talk to at my job, but we don't hang out outside of work. I've learned how to keep myself entertained, but now I long for companionship. I still sometimes struggle with my social anxiety and am afraid of putting myself out there only to push people away like I did before. Also I'm kinda shy so it's hard to talk to people lol. Anyone else out there a loner feeling a little lonesome? I'm new to redditt, so I'm hoping I did this right.

"I donât remember exactly when it started, but I do remember all those lonely walks home from school. I remember picking up snow and see it melt in my hand and I would tell myself that it was me. I was about 11 I think. 

It all turned worse once I got in my teens. I sort of just lived thru it and yes I made my parents life a living hell by being angry. Today I believe that was all a cry for help. I did a lot of weird shit, some weird relationships. But I always worked and maintained a job. All the time. I did all my chores and I tried I really did. 

Then you turn 18 and your supposed to start living. I left to work in FL, didnât work and moved back to Europe. A lot back and forth and finally decided to be a nurse because of pressure from my parents. At this point I was angry all the time again, but I worked hard to maintain composure and let it all out while I was alone and yes I was alone a lot of the time. 

I met my husband (just got married on Friday) and I thought life would finally make a turn for the better. We decided to move FL after some months in Europe and I was for once excited about life. FL didnât really work out because school was not what I thought it was. 

So now we live back in Europe under my parents roof until we find an apartment and yesterday it all came crashing down again. 

I have always been thought to speak my mind if something is not right. Iâm 22 turning 23 this year and Iâm still being treated as a child. My own father stood and watched me cry and told me I never did anything right and that Iâm an embarrassment to the family. I have learned to control my temper, but I am a loud and sarcastic person and maybe sometimes that doesnât work. 

It all came crashing down yesterday and I havenât felt this bad in years. I told my father I wanted to see a shrink, but he laughed at me and told me to grow a pair. He told me that nothing I do is ever good enough and that Iâm just rude. 

I donât know what more to do. I do everything they tell me. I go to school and I work. I smile and try to be funny. I guess the voice was right. I was never good enough and I never will be. ",4,sort of just lived thru it and yes I made my parents life a living hell by being angry
"I feel bad bc I had to turn away the pest control guy today bc my apt was too messy. The last time the pest control people came apparently they complained to my landlord bc the apt was so messy, and then the landlord sent an email scolding me. It pisses me off bc imo as long as I'm not doing any structural or permanent damage to the property I should be able to live in filth if I want to. But I also know that the way I'm living now isn't healthy. I'm just reluctant to clean bc cleaning up would require admitting to myself that the way I'm living now isn't normal or good for me. 

I also find it difficult to eat. I keep cooking too much pasta, realizing I don't want to eat (even when I'm hungry), and leaving it out to stick to the pan or rot. (Yep, turns out if you leave pasta in the sink for a while green stuff will grow all over it!) I think it's partly bc I like the light-headed feeling of not eating enough and drinking too much coffee. It's basically a cheap and easy way to get high. But lately whenever I ""eat well"" I end up getting intense stomachaches anyway. I had a steak yesterday bc I knew I needed protein but I ended up just getting stomach cramps and diarrhea. 

My dad died when I was young and my mom went back to work. She would always have to get up early and would get mad at me for making dinner late (I've always been a night owl) or not doing the dishes. In retrospect I totally understand why she'd get so mad (I *was* being disrespectful) but basically it just made me feel intense shame and that everything I do in the kitchen is basically filthy and gross. Also if I i.e. washed the dishes but didn't put them in the dishwasher she'd get just as mad and I think I unconsciously internalized that unless I completely clean up the kitchen I may as well just let everything sit around and rot. 

My main motivation to clean up would be so I could have friends over without feeling ashamed. (So far I've only let one person who I trust see my apt and I still felt like a gross weirdo.) 

The thing is actually I find dish-washing very calmly sometimes. I've found that concentrating on thinking about the process and how cleaning dishes is satisfying makes me want to clean a lot more than beating myself up about how everything is disgusting. 

Anyway does anyone have any advice for getting yourself to clean things up beyond ""break it into small steps"" ",4,"My dad died when I was young and my mom went back to work, She would always have to get up early and would get mad at me for making dinner late (I've always been a night owl) or not doing the dishes"

"So I heard that I should find a creative outlet to help cope with my depression...
I've been suicidal for 5 years, pretty much as long as I've been depressed.
Im to cowardly to actually do it but I just kind of wanna stop existing, I'm just extremely sad although I don't fully understand why.
So I'm kind of by myself venting because nobody really cares, I spend most of everyday just talking to myself... Mostly self hatred negative thoughts and I guess I'm a small cause of my depression.
So I'm kind of just looking for a creative outlet to let out my sadness and depression, so I have like three ideas for it. One of my major ways of coping with depression is joking about it, it has become a really good coping strategy believe it or not.
I wanted to do a couple things
1 I wanted to start a YouTube channel
2 I wanted to start publishing my art
3 I wanted to start animating

I really enjoy drawing, I love it and it's a form of coping for me.
YouTube is kind of just something for me to not feel alone, I probably won't actually do it though I just think it'd be interesting to get like minded depressed people to kind of hang out idk but there is a lot of us that seem to relate easily.
Animating has always been kind of cool, I love adventure Time and Rick and Morty, although it's kind of expensive at first I think it'd be a fun hobby for me to invest in.

Do you guys have any tips though, im just trying to keep my head up as long as possible without breaking down.

"Here's my story,
I have recently turned fourteen and I've recently noticed some really weird changes in my feelings and my behaviors.  I'm not sure where to start so I will try to explain my emotional state recently.
Some pretty weird things have been happeing to me latley and I'm not so sure what to think of them.  I've started having these ""episodes"" where I get super upset for no reason (the no reason is actually another problem I've been having which I will get into in just a second) and I'll just start ignoring people who text me which makes them worried and super upset.  And the ""no reason"" has been a super big problem for me and that problem is when other people treat me indifferently?  Its like when someone talks to me and they'll talk to me in a way that makes them seem like they don't care about me (now I want to adress that this is indeed an incredibly selfish point of view but I don't know how to work on it and make it stop or go away) and it makes me feel like total shit and just start hating everthing.  
I've also noticed that I have barley eaten, which is a pretty normal thing for me because I'm super fucking picky and only eat like snack foods french fries and mcdonalds, but now I'm actually getting scared for myself like today I was basically starving so I went to make waffles at 2 fucking AM.  I'm also aware that not eating is a sign of depression which is kinda scary to me as well because I fell like theres a super high chance that I'm depressed but I do not fucking believe it what so ever. 
I hate trying to talk about how I feel about this stuff to other people because I always feel like its me begging for attention because I'm in eighth grade and I'm used to people talking about their ""depression"" for no reason other than attention.  So I always feel like talking about it is just begging for attention (even though that is a stupid way to look at things because people with real depression do need to communicate and get help) and I always feel bad talking to people about it. 
I really don't know what to do and would like some advice and/or help with this.  I'm also aware that I'm not a very good writer so some of these things lack detail and might just be out of order or not make any sense so if you have any questions fell free to ask so I can try and get you information that you need.

"Hi all, 

I am a 20 year old male in college and I have been going through an especially hard time lately, so I wanted to share my story with depression and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. My hope is that my writing this out I can relieve some pain and maybe if anyone else is struggling with something similar they can feel comfort knowing they are not alone. I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 7 years old, after I got a strep throat infection I started experiencing symptoms of the disorder such as ticks (biting my shirt, blinking my eyes excessively, craning my neck a certain way a lot). I worried about little things, such as if there was a seam on my sock or a tag on my shirt, I would feel so much discomfort that I could not wear it. When I worried about things, sometimes I felt pains in either side of my body, if I didn't feel the pain in the other side of my body it felt wrong and the decision I made in my head felt wrong.

Anyway, my ticks got worse after taking a certain medication that I forget the name of, and then they got better after I got off it. I started having more rituals, like washing my hands and walking across mirrors multiple times to get it ""right"". This later turned into more obsessive thoughts, which are what I primarily suffer from now. I am not in therapy right now and I am not taking any medication. In high school, I feel like I was happier because I had a small group of friends and a best friend who was a girl that I loved. A year later, I did not talk to any of those friends including that girl because she did not reciprocate feelings and we stopped talking to each other soon after that. This was really hard for me at the time, she was so funny and genuinely nice I thought, she was absolutely beautiful and I took her to prom which was a shitty night because she ignored me most of the night. I ignored that red flag, and many others, I was 18 and I had never been in a relationship before and I fell for her hard.

After we stopped talking to each other, which was around December of 2016, I believe she texted me out of the blue in March of last year and we chatted a bit. That was all the contact we had until we saw each other at school when the semester started 4 months ago because she goes to the same college I do. It was good to see her, she told me she had a boyfriend that she broke up and he was an asshole, I had never met him. At the time I told myself that was okay she had moved on, I accepted that she was changing on and that I could move on too. I underestimated my feelings though because I ended up texting her and apologizing to her for whatever reason, and she apologized too. Things were well and good until I found out she had another boyfriend through a story she posted on Snapchat, and I freaked out. I blocked her phone number, Snapchat, Instagram and everything. I completely cut contact with her for 4 months. Until 2 weeks ago, and we had a great time recently as friends but she cut me off again and I don't know if I deserve it or not but it makes me feel bad of course.

I have a part time job, but it's not enough hours and I am going to see if I can't get more or maybe find something to do on the side. It makes me feel worse to not work or go to school and be around other people, I do not have any friends now, and I have been crying over something every day in recent months because of my depression. My family does not think I have depression, my mom has the key on the gate because she had postpartum depression and according to her that was real depression but not mine. I am just ""stir crazy"" from not working, and she is pushing me to get another job. When she says that to me it makes me feel invalid and worthless, which I feel like anyway pretty much anyway, I love her but I hate it when she makes me feel this way about myself. My dad does not think too much about my mental health, and neither does my mom's boyfriend.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my story with you all. It made me feel better to type it out as I have been having an extremely hard week. I was on a high because my best friend and I started talking again and spending time together 2 weeks ago, now she is ignoring me and I am not sure why. Now I have been crying just about every hour of every day and out of the past 48 hours I have probably slept through 20 of those hours. I hurt myself again and have been treating the wounds but they were stinging so bad sometimes. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.",4,did not talk to any of those friends including that girl because she did not reciprocate feelings and we stopped talking to each other soon after that

I did a test where I didn't message anyone for about 2 weeks to see who would check up on me. No one did with the exception of my gf. I Don't know. I feel blessed having supportive parents and a loving girlfriend. But I just can't shake the feeling of feeling so alone without them. They are the only people I actually talk to. other than that im just either sitting down thinking or working on my car. If i didn't have my parents or my gf i don't think I'd really have anyone. It's getting really tiring trying too keep myself busy so i wouldn't have to think about this.

"So the thing here is I stopped caring about my reputation. I care nothing about keeping a good reputation and some of my friends warned me about keeping a 'good' reputation. I seem to be the easy going and not caring kind of person, is it related to me being a girl? Is that why I have to respect everything and say that I'm good with everything other people say? Do I have to 'fake' being a polite girl? I know it's because I have different cultures but I don't feel like it's myself or me.Do I really have to change myself? Do I have to stop doing this kind of attitude? What did I do wrong here? I didn't even realised when I stopped caring about anyone or anything, it just happened.

"It's been a crappy winter so far. Found out I'm going to be out of a job at the end of the month and I don't know what else I'm going do do with myself.

My car is continuing to fall apart. I had been saving some money in hopes of buying a new one, but I'm not quite going to be there when the revenue stops.

On top of that, I've developed a skin condition right near my eyes, and having it happen over the holidays has made scheduling a specialist very difficult. It's gotten worse since then and I don't think it's going to heal easily.

Apart from all of that, I declined to go to a relatively important holiday party because I feel like crap. I already have a terrible social life, but I'm not making things any better for myself. Worst of all, I fell like I seriously disrespected the people I avoided and missed a once in a lifetime chance to know them better. I suck suck suck.

I knew I was going to feel bad about staying home, but felling how I do lately, I just can't handle myself.

"I suffer from some serious intermittent depression. It's never gotten so bad to the point I seriously thought about suicide, but it gets to a point where I am a completely different person. I get angry or sad for little to no reason, I don't talk as much, and I find myself with little to no motivation. 

I've kind of suffered a perfect storm for it though, admittedly. I lost both of my parents before I was old enough to drink, I was made fun of and picked on in middle school, was a pothead loser in high school, and now here I am a 24 year old man with no friends and a girlfriend I'm not exactly satisfied with. 

I get depressed every now and then; one could say that is quite normal and everyone does. But one thing that I don't think is normal is that I've never, ever been truly happy. I know that there are people that wake up in the morning and can't help but smile because their life is awesome and they feel incredibly happy. With most people it's because of a certain thing that they have that keeps their spirits high. Perhaps it's a wonderful significant other that makes them feel like they won the lottery. Perhaps they are blessed with astonishingly good looks or intelligence. With many, it could just be that you have good family and friends to pick you up. 

I have virtually none of these things. I have no reason to be happy. And I never have been. I can't recall in recent memory ever being in an uplifting mood one could deem happy. In fact, I'm aware and those close to me are aware of the fact that I am almost completely emotionally numb. I don't feel happy or sad or mad 90 percent of the time. Terrible things will happen, such as a family member passing away, and I won't feel any remorse. 

I know that this is likely just another one of those intermittent batches of depression, but I can't help but feel that this is the truth. I'm a pathetic, broken man that doesn't really have a reason to wake up happy. 

I'm not sure what I'm trying to get out of this post. Maybe to see if others have felt the same? Does anyone else feel emotionally numb? Does anyone else find looking at others happiness depressing? Does anyone else feel that they've never been happy? Because at times it feels like I'm the only one on Earth that does.

"Hi, I'm 17, male, and I've been having depressed thoughts for about a year now (not sure if that qualifies as having depression). I have friends, but I'm constantly scared that they don't actually like me and when they do i assume they're lying (i have been lied to about that in the past and that makes it hard to trust them). Im not close with any of them after they all turned on me when someone spread rumors about me once (long story, we sorted it out but i don't feel right about them after they hated me so quickly without question). 

I'm constantly terrified of being too obsessive around the people i like and driving them away, and that I'm way too desperate for a friendship or relationship i can feel good about. I get extremely self loathing around them and this causes those who i am close with to get annoyed at me i think. Im scared of opening up to anyone about how bad my self hatred has gotten because theyll just think it's juvenile (not sure about that myself tbh) or whether it's just me fishing for sympathy. I try to be nice to people but i think i take it to an extreme and be too apologetic of anything i think may annoy someone slightly. I have no idea what to do with myself so i read or play games to turn my brain off so i don't have to think about anything. 

 I wish i could talk to someone about it all since it makes me feel better but i feel like they'll just be annoyed at me for wasting their time. I constantly have this feeling in my chest of worthlessness that i feel physically, it keeps me awake at night and wears me down. I never used to consider suicide until a few months back, but now these thoughts are getting more and more frequent until I'm thinking them every day. I just want to make this feeling go away and I'll do anything to make it happen. I'm sorry for posting this here but i don't know what to do, i feel so purposeless and i want it to end. I've never spoken about these feelings with anyone. I don't know if there's a specific subreddit for venting so I'm sorry if this isn't the right place.

"A little background on me. I'm a 17 (soon to be 18) year old dude. What I meant by ""she makes me feel"" is that before her, all my feelings were very mild, sometimes even nonexistant. Like I didn't really fear anything (except for a weird fear of spiders, but that's besides the point), but I also don't think I've felt love or genuine happiness before. And I was fine with that, I liked being logical and that worked.

But this summer I met a girl. For anonymity purposes, we'll call her L. Now, L is the sweetest, most caring person I have ever met. We started talking at my summer job and instantly we clicked. Like our sense of humour is pretty much the same and she just feels so easy to talk to. If this isn't the place to post this then please poimt me im the right direction because I'd love some other perspectives on this problem since I'm completely incompetent.

Anyways, I've begun to notice that I feel genuine excitement whenever she texts me and I feel really happy while talking with her. But on the flipside, I feel like she's opened up all the shit feelings as well. I've never struggled with depression before, but I think I have it now. I've cried myself to sleep at 3 am more times than I'd like to admit and whenever I make her unhappy in any way I genuinely feel like killing myself.

So my question is this : Is it worth it? Are the good feelings worth the underlying crippling sadness that feels like it keeps slowly eating away at me? I understand that this might seem like teenage angst but I really don't know this, I've never had to deal with this kind of situation. So any responses and different perspectives are welcome, thank you for reading.

**TL:DR** Met a girl this summer who makes me feel amazing most of the time. The downside is that now I think I have some sort of depression and suicidal thoughts.",4,started talking at my summer job and instantly we clicked.

"Everything is falling or has fallen apart.  My dad killed himself several years ago because my mom left him for some douchebag with money.  My dog followed three months later.  I got an incurable STD from someone I trusted but shouldn't have.  Ive lost my license, and my car.  Im trapped in a dead end janitorial job that Ive been maxed out in for the last 3 years.  My spare income goes towards weed, so I can keep myself blithe and functional.  All I can do is go to work in a few hours and pretend everything is cool.  Nothing will ever change.  I'll always be poor.  I'll always be lonely, I'll always be depressed.  The woman I've been talking to is married, and on top of it, I think is close to dumping me for another side guy.  I could be imagining that.  Things have been different for several weeks.  Then since we've gotten closer to the New Year, she distanced herself more and more.  I think she's trying to get me to break up with her so she can move on guilt free.  I don't know.  We barely communicate.  It seems like she has better things to do.  

My intentions are to continue suffering through life, chain smoking, pounding sugar, and eating junk, until I get diabetes, heart disease, or cancer, and let it go untreated to kill me.  I have tremendous respect for people who have the balls to kill themselves.  Im not strong enough to be one of them.

"I really want to connect with people. I really want to be understood, like normal people can understand each other. I really really really really want that.

Why does it have to be this way? No matter what I do I'll always be ""different"" and a ""weirdo"". FUCK THAT.

Fucking, what the fuck am I supposed to do, what am I supposed to do when the only way to connect with someone is to change, but change is impossible? I've felt like this ALL fucking month, but obviously I'm on a comedown right now, I think. Does butalbital have a comedown? I don't know.

Like, why does it have to be shit? I want to feel close to someone, I want someone to hold in my arms. I tried, I worked out, I cared about my appearance, I did everything right. Everything that I could-- and yet, I'm still stuck here just as alone as before. I'm stuck in my room, on a computer.

Is that too much to ask? Is that obsessive? Just to want someone to connect with, and hold? When, your whole life, you've been unable to connect with anyone. Even my own DAMN family, none of them ""get"" me. Why the fuck would a random stranger be able to get through to me? I'm fucking, hopelessly hopeful, that someone is going to come along and expose my soft side, that nobody knows I have.

I have a fucking heart, but I can't share it. There's no way to do that. I'm so depressed, now. It's not just the depression. It's everything. Everything I am, and everything I ever will be. Humans only have each other. But me, I'm not human. So I have nobody. I'm an alien, autistic, spaghetti-spilling retard doomed to never be understood or considered.

I want to just swallow all the rest of my barbs and finish a 6 pack. Fuck it, that's the only way I feel good, anymore. Drugs are the only way I feel good.

I'm too fuckin young for this shit. Why? Why me? I can't do this shit. People tell me ""you have time"". Time can't fix a broken robot.

I don't even know why I'm here. I have Asperger's. Nothing can fix me. Nothing can change me. I'm destined to be alone. I can't help myself, and nobody can help me. I want to be different, from the way I am, so baaadddd.. I want to be normal so badddd. It's so bad I just would rather die than live this disconnected.

So a little about myself and why I am posting here now. I have been lurking in this subreddit on and off since I found out it existed, about 6 months back. I've been dealing with a lot of dark thoughts and surprisingly don't even want to get better. I have no idea where all of these dark thoughts are coming from since I had a good childhood and was always a nice guy and good friends that I could count on. However, since I started university (2 years ago, in my final year now), I've distanced myself from my friends and to some extent my family. There was no apparent reason for it. This distancing however lead to me realising my own feelings more and more and to some extent ""find my inner self"". All my life I've dealt with my issues by helping others resolve their and I've always gotten by one way or another, with me abandoning most of my friends this has led to me not being able to help others. As a result of that I've had to deal with my own problems on my own and had to face them. Let's just say that did not go well. I am 6 months away from graduating and have zero idea of what I want to do with my life. I have my parents counting on me to figure this out and frankly that pressure keeps getting me into panic attacks every time I think about it and I start breathing faster, my heart beat goes up and I just want to start shouting.

"Long story short, I have long suspected that I have at least a mild form of depression. 

I function okay on the day-to-day and present ""normal"" and am not suicidal, but I go through waves where I become extremely upset (a.k.a. ball my eyes out about the state of my life every few months) and deep down I am pretty chronically unhappy with my life, although I try to avoid thinking about this very often because it just makes me sad. 

I come from a family of high achievers that doesn't believe in this kind of stuff (if i were to say I am depressed, they will just say you are lazy, in a funk, etc.) and I am broke/do not have health insurance (so therapy/meds out of the question). 

Is there an online test or something I can take to see if I have depression? Obviously I know it cannot take the place of a medical professional, but that isn't an option for me right now.

"Hey guys, this might be pretty long but I have stuff I need to talk about. Oh, and I'm using a throwaway because a family member knows my main account name.

So, I've had depression for as long as I can remember, Originally, I though I was depressed because I was just lonely, so I spent a couple of years on a few dating sites where no one would talk to me because I'm not good looking enough. That made me feel even more worthless than I already did. Until my current girlfriend came along and started a long distance relationship with me. 

When she came into my life, I was in a particularly dark spot where I was having suicidal thoughts constantly and I even got out of bed at one point to grab my scissors and end it all. I eventually decided not to do it and went back to bed. The day after that last part, my girlfriend started talking to me, that was almost 2 years ago now and since she came into my life, I've gotten better and am much happier, generally, than I used to be.

A couple of months or so ago my suicidal thoughts were coming back and I told her about it (she knows everything above this) and then she started freaking out and getting depressed because she felt like she wasn't helping me at all. I reassured her that she was helping me and she didn't need to freak out or get depressed. A couple of days after that, the suicidal thoughts went away for a while.

Lately however, my depression's just really been getting to me and I'm just tired of living. I don't really want any advice, I just want to vent somewhere where I don't have to tell my girlfriend because I don't want her being depressed because of me again. Anyway, I'm getting off point here. Sorry about that.

Now, I did say I originally thought I was just depressed because I'm lonely. After being with my girlfriend, we eventually came to the conclusion that it's not really because I'm lonely, I honestly just don't have a reason for it. My life isn't bad, I'm in college and have an amazing girlfriend who wants to spend her life with me. I don't know, maybe I'm just broken or something. I think I should just end this here. I'm not actually going to kill myself or anything, but I am just so tired of being alive. I'm sorry if this isn't an appropriate place to post this, but I posted it here because it's something I don't want to tell anyone I know and I don't know where else to talk.

"I get this shit all the time. I'm not allowed to complain about my job because ""That's just how it is"". I tried opening up about recent depressive episode, I felt like I'd been kicked in the nuts because after weeks of work getting myself back on my feet my reward was my shitty ass job. The response I get from my family ""Suck it up, we've all been there"". 

I took a long hard fucking look at them, none of them are happy. They're just permanently angry. They're angry at people who have it better, yeah sometimes someone else gets lucky, but they're always just fucking resentful, never supportive. They think they're so much better, if they're better why are they angry? Why are they constantly complaining? If they're better than their managers, their bosses, their peers who got a promotion or the neighbours that have a stable family, why are they the ones with the loveless marriage, the ones that are passed up for promotions? 

They get fucking angry when I take time off for mental illness, ""If you're not in a mental hospital you're well enough to go to work"". Knowing them if I did go back to the psych ward they'd probably berate me for stealing money off of the NHS. I'd be open to them having issues that need to be worked out too, but I have no sympathy for them if they're gonna shit on other mentally ill folk instead of fixing themselves.

And if not? Fuck you. Just because you spend your time being angry, finding ways to put others down and digging yourself a bigger rut doesn't mean I have to. Yeah, I'm depressed, but so fucking what? I know I'm going to accomplish way more than they ever will. 

I spent the past week crying myself to sleep again. Need to go back to the Doctor and re-evaluate my meds, I don't know when I'll be able to go back to work full-time and I don't have any money for anything other than basic food and medication, but you know what? At least I'm not some self-righteous cunt who lives to ruin someone else's life. Fuck em. I'm gonna cry again tonight, most likely, but I'm not gonna blame it on someone else. I'm gonna fix my shit and at the very least not drag someone else down with me if I fail.

I'm so glad my Mom is one of the few genuinely caring people in this family. God knows I'd go insane without her support. It certainly makes up for everyone else.",4,"not allowed to complain about my job ,The response I get from my family ""Suck it up, we've all been there"

"Hey everyone. Some context, I'm 16, sophomore, this all happened through my mid freshmen and mid sophomore year. I have pretty bad depression but got medication about maybe two months ago.

My once best friend lives over 7,000 miles away from me. She lives in South Africa while I live in the United States, specifically in central Texas. I met her on an app called ""talklife"" where you just vented about... life! I had made a post about how I hated myself, and I was in tears when one day she messaged me. She said she would be willing to be there for me and eventually our friendship really started to grow. She trusted me really quickly.

We mostly communicated on whatsapp. One day she randomly messaged me saying she hurt herself. It broke my heart. I wish I could have been there for her in person to hug her and be there for her. But I couldn't, but I did my best to comfort her. She opened up a lot on what she's been through. Bullying, parental abuse, and at one point a boy from her school pretty much threatened to rape her and nobody would take her seriously when she talked about it.

We both came to each other whenever we were hurt. I doubt she would ever admit it but she was a little clingy to me at one point, like she never stopped messaging me and sent me pictures and videos of herself randomly. She made me feel really important. But I soon became waaay more clingy than she ever was. I was very attached to her. Being the closest friend I have ever had and the first person I would go to when I was hurting. 

I think my clingyness to her, along with my insecurity and depression, made things start to go downhill in our friendship. The first time we had a fight was when I was having an awful day at school and I was dying to vent to her. I was holding in tears at my classes and needed to talk but she was busy and constantly going offline. I felt like she was ignoring me and I told her ""fuck you"" and blocked her. It was weird, I felt better after that. I shouldn't have, because I potentially just ruined a friendship, but I felt better just being nasty, like it got my frustration and hurt out.

I unblocked her and apologized but she was hurting. However I recorded a video of myself just talking and apologizing, and admitting how I was a dick, and she really felt way happier after seeing it and seemed back in a good mood. I was glad she wasn't holding a grudge and felt better after the video I sent her.

It may sound weird to send her a video of myself, but I think net neutrality is not a thing in South Africa, so she has some bundle she says where she can use a couple apps but is unable to call at all. It took me a while to understand.

We had a lot of arguments along our friendship. A lot of times I questioned if it was getting toxic. However whenever we explained both our sides and admitted our faults, we were on good terms again. However, I still think it was taking a toll on our friendship.

There was a point where we got into an argument about something, I don't remember exactly all the details, but here's what I remember.

So we had planned to want to visit sometime. One day I watched a documentary on South Africa over it's gangs and crimes, and I jokingly told her I changed my mind over visiting. It was a dick move to joke about but I told her I didn't mean it, and that she should calm down. She started going off on me and I kind of ignored it. She later posted something on her status with her parents hugging her and it's caption said ""abuse."" I know it seems like a joke, but she has told me about how her mom hits her and has made her cry in fear, and how she's felt suicidal because of how her mom treated her, so I wasn't sure. I told her if she needed anyone I was hear and she told me ""Uhm... it was a joke."" I know that doesn't seem rude to say, but by her standards it really is. I was pretty insulted and I started kind of going off on her.

Eventually I tried to apologize but she wouldn't respond. I called her a disease and she told me she wished me a good life but couldn't take this and blocked me, ""for good."" I messaged her through my brother, messaging her school's name. She had a uniform on her Instagram she gave me where it said her school's name in big bold letters, I didn't stalk her or anything. She unblocked me and kind of panicked, but I told her how I found her school's name. I texted her it because I learned freaking her out gets her to message people back. I said let's try to fix things but she wasn't budging. I started getting mad and feeling very hurt. I felt like if she was a real friend she would try to fix things with me, and not cut me off, especially considering how close we were. When I look back on this know, I was pretty stupid for how mean I was to her, and not realizing she was just tired of all the arguing and me hurting her.

I told her some incredibly nasty things, bringing up a lot of the things she struggled with and vented to me about, only to have me use it against her and break her down. I could tell I was getting to her, really making her hurt. I was acting like a sadist over her ""being a fake friend"" which she wasn't. Simply tired of the arguments, my temper and emotional bullying. She soon blocked me later.

I wish I realised that my reaction was so stupid. In my mind I just viewed her as being a fake friend, and never meaning any of the times she was there for me since she wouldn't want to fix things with me.

The feeling of her being a fake friend really hurt me and made me kind of crazy. I cried a lot because I felt so betrayed. I borrowed my friend's phone's to text her things like ""you should kill yourself"" and ""you just lost the only friend you had."" Just really nasty things. At one point, I made an entire account on Instagram dedicated to making fun of her. I posted dumb edits of her face and made posts going into detail why I thought she was a piece of shit. I followed a ton of her peers and got up to like 700 followers at one point. I informed her about it and she started freaking out.

A couple weeks pass. One day, a friend of her's, who was also mine too, saw one of my posts and sent it to her to maybe make her realise some of the scummy things she has been doing. I made them sound a lot worse than they really were yet not quite making it a lie. She said she wasn't going to read it and was starting to get over what I had done. My friend reminded her of the times I was there for her, and how if I was hurting this much she obviously meant a lot to me, and him saying that made her unblock me and forgive me. I was very skeptical but we talked things out and I deleted the account even though I still felt like she was being fake to me.

I needed to get somethings off my chest and in a voice note I told her how she had hurt me before the account was made, and I was still having trouble if I wanted to be her friend or not. She then told me that she was sorry for the hurt she caused, but then she told me the hurt she felt from what I did.

She said every day she walked into school terrified that someone would bring up the account. She would hurt herself and contemplated suicide constantly while the account was up and while I sent her those disgusting messages. She tried to force herself to be strong but all it did was push her suicidal urges down for a short time. She cried while saying all this and said she was scared to be my friend again, because she didn't want me to hurt her like that again.

It hurt so much. I started crying and really felt like shit. I explained more of the hurt I felt but also gave a deeper apology and explained more on things that had contributed to me being an asshole. She then recorded a very long voice note, I think about 9 minutes, talking about how she was sorry for making me cry and the hurt she caused before, and how she forgave me, and how she was my glad to be my friend again.

That feeling I had when we fixed all that shit was truly amazing. I felt so much better. But I also felt a lot of guilt for what I had done to her, but I was glad we were friends again. I tried to be kinder and more patient and understanding with her. But honestly it didn't work. We had another big argument shortly.

She told me she was planning on trashing her phone. I was really hurt. It was the only way I had to contact her, as she couldn't mail me since her mom couldn't stand online friends. I told her I was feeling like shit because of her doing this, but she said it was because she truly believed she would be happier without her phone, and she wasn't doing it to trash me. That's not how I felt and when I got those messages I had to lock myself in the bathroom and cry. I felt so unimportant to her.

We argued about it for a while but I kept trying to keep in my frustration and hurt. Then randomly one day I snapped. All those feelings of her being a fake friend came back. I told her I was so fucking done with her and if she ever messaged me again I would reactivate the account, and that she should go die in a hole.

A couple days later I apologized but asked her to still not contact me, and eventually after about two weeks I asked to talk to her. She said all the suicidal feelings came back and she went back to her habit of harming herself and crying to sleep. She kept saying things like ""go ahead, tell me I should die"" when I was apologizing and she eventually threatened to kill herself. I contacted her mom through one of her friends and told her to make sure she was okay. I know she was abusive but I know she wouldn't let her kill herself. She was okay, but she also told her all the things I did to her, which resulted in her mom telling me to kill myself and threatened me with a court case and tracking me down if she had to. Honestly wasn't worried about her threats at all, and even if I did get in trouble, well I deserved it.

So yeah, I am sorry this was so damn long. I just wanted this entire situation off my chest. I feel so guilty for how I hurt her and constantly cry at night because of it, and I miss her so much. I wish I wasn't such an asshole. I have never treated anybody so poorly in my life yet she's the closest friend I have ever had. I'm usually extra nice to girls and I was always there for her when she was hurting or needed anyone but sometimes my emotions would go crazy and my mind would get truly fucked up. A lot of it has to do with us being only online friends. I really don't treat any of my friends in real life like that.

I really wish she would listen to me apologize and kind of explain why I was hurt, and allow me to make it up to her by maybe like mailing her a gift. I miss her. I genuinely hope she's okay. I don't want to believe I'm an awful person because I do care about her, and so many other people in my life, but sometimes I'm just a terrible person with the way I explode. I don't know if I should forgive myself, I feel like I deserve to hate myself and have everyone around me hate me.

*TL;DR I emotionally tormented my best friend because I was so insecure and vengeful for times she really hurt me, even though it usually wasn't her fault, and it resulted in so much harm towards her. I feel like I deserve so much worse because of what I did.*

"Hey guys. This might sound funny to you (it sounds funny even to me lol), but i'm really ashamed of my past.

I'm 17 year old, and about 5 months ago I shaved my head. Previously, I had mid-sized hair and I was a cute guy, but when I cut my hair I looked really, really bad. Some people even couldn't recognise me. But that's not everything - one day I got drunk with my friend and we shaved the ends of our eyebrows (yeah, we really did it), so I looked like a serial killer or a pedophile... I literally wanted to cut my whole head next morning.

Few days later, I was at brother's birthday party and I took some photos with him and his friends, and one of the guys posted the photo of us on facebook. He didn't tag me, but he tagged my friend, who is in my class. He even put a cover photo with me and some other guys... 

Now, here comes the real problem...

A few weeks ago, I met a girl through one of my classmates (not the one I mentioned before), and now we're in relationship. Now, I'm scared that he could maybe tell her about my hair-shaving, or that my girlfriend could find my bald photos (4 of them) on facebook.

Yes, I know this is a really funny and strange story, but I don't know how to deal with this... I'm thinking about this whole day. That simply kills me, because she'll probably find them one day (and maybe even break up with me), and I don't know how should i react...

"Have any of you lost a pet that you raised and were solely responsible for? My depression has gotten really bad again in the past 2 years and I've spent alot of that time in my room or depressed outside in a zoned out state of mind. One of my best buddies which was my Lovebird absolutely loved being around me. They are silly little birds and do really odd things and love to snuggle with you.

But with my depression I used alot of that time being by myself without my bird. Of course like most things you don't realize how incredibly important they are to you till it's too late. When I woke up to find Kiwi dead in her food bowl I was just devastated. It really didn't hit me bad till a few days later when I realized how she could of helped me during my depression and how my depression caused her to live a lonelier life as well. I knew it was my fault 100% why she died and looked into alot of things that I thought were safe for birds that did harm to her. 

I even did a proper funeral box for her, wrapped her in an orange towel, flowers, golden sacred art with quartz crystals and buried her in my backyard. 
It even got the people in the parrot sub to shed some tears. 

Time hasn't helped and I truly feel like a part of me, one of the few remaining pieces of happiness has been torn away from me. No matter what she always wanted to hang out with me and we've been through alot the 10 years I had her. I still remember coming back from the hospital after my suicide attempt where I was gone for a few weeks and when I came home she freaked out when she saw it was me, chirping and flying around the cage like she couldn't believe I was back. I used to meditate with her outside, play all types of games and now its all over.

Sometimes you get that one pet where it's just a really incredible bond and it sucks when something shitty like depression ruins the time I'll never get back with her along with the stress or loneliness I caused her.

If any of you have pets you love, really try to be with them more often to see if they will at least rid your mind of depression or at least have the comfort in knowing that your making them happen. It may not solve your problems but this whole situation has shown me how delicate life is. 

I don't know exactly the reason for this post, I just wanted to get my feelings out there in case any of you are animal lovers, try not to let depression destroy that friendship/bond where a pet can sometimes love you no matter what.",4,Have any of you lost a pet that you raised and were solely responsible for

Parts of this text that talk about social capital really resonate with me since many of the examples it mentions I did experience before but couldn't figure out what was happening at the time. 

It felt like when you realize nobody was laughing with you but at you.

But worst of all is that I have nothing to counter those arguments, in particular the ones in the first half of it.

"I'm considered by close friends to be a calm and happy person. I never actually lash out on anyone. When I hang out with people I would say I am pretty fine.

Then when I am alone, I get these intense feeling of anger over miniscule and insignificant things. Things like someone making a mean joke at my expense a long time ago, if they said/did something that made me shut down, or that time my roommate made a mess and I had to clean it up.

These incidents can be months old and resolved, but they keep repeating in my head and I find myself getting increasingly angry.

"I've been suffering with anxiety and depression for a while now but it has increasingly gotten worse within the last year and I feel like there is no getting better.

I have not seeked medical advice as I dont know where to start and what to say. I dont know what made me this way and I just wish it was as simple as popping to the shops and buying some pills to make it all better. There is more important things in the world than me and I dont want to waste anyones time.

I used to cope by keeping myself busy and pushing myself to do anything and everything to avoid having to sit with just my own thoughts for company. But its beating me and the motivation to do anything is becoming none existent, it's like I want to but I cant push through the voices in my head and the pressure on my chest.

My friends seem to be becoming more and more distant with little understanding on whats going on with me but too wrapped up in their own lifes.

A hand full of my work collegues seem to be going through a similar thing but can come off quite judgemental and I honestly think if I confided in them they would just think I was after attention and 'jumping on the bandwagon'. And the other hand full slag off depression as if it doesnt exist or they are worse off as if its a competition.

My family have their own issues and I feel as much as they would love to help they need to focus on themselves and each other.

My boyfriend is the one person I thought I could rely on to speak to and make me feel at comfort if not better when im at my worst but nearly a month ago he nearly broke up with me. I fear its gotten too much for him. He has since said he didnt mean it and you dont realise what you've got until its nearly gone but its broken me. The one person I thought I could be myself with and express my true feelings and now its just another face to put on.

Life just feels like one massive show at the moment that i'm doing on my own and trying my best to see it through until the end. Can things just suddenly get better? What do you do to make yourself feel better?

"Before I start, I just wanna say that I am in no danger of harming myself, I'm simply just going through a rough patch in life. 

I'm in the middle of winter break of my senior year of college and have never felt more lonely. Despite having a strong friend group at college and being in an amazing relationship with someone I love very much, I feel totally isolated. Many of my friends from college and my girlfriend live in the same town, while I live 3 states and 10 hours away from them. At home, I have found that, since starting college, all of my friends from high school have practically abandoned me. Despite seeing them frequently hanging out over the past 4 years on social media, I have yet to receive a response to any of the texts I've sent out, and, as a result, I find myself at home with no social life, thus causing a strong re-emergence of my depression that has pretty much taken over my thoughts. I live in a pretty rural area, so there aren't many ways to meet new people over break due to how spread out everything is and the extremely cold weather. While I've been able to spend some time with my family, my parents have to work most days. 

While my friends and girlfriend have been hanging out frequently, I've been delegated to sitting at home alone browsing through netflix. To make matters more difficult for me, I've been pretty open with my girlfriend about my situation but have found that she has been rather unresponsive due to a very active social life and busy family schedule at home. Its important to also understand that she has serious depression as well and recently moved to the town she's currently in 2 years ago and had some trouble meeting people as well, something with she has obviously overcome.  There have been one or two days where we've been able to text back and forth for a few hours, where I've been able to share my feelings with her about my break and have received helpful advice and comforting words in response; however a majority of our days have been delegated to a ""good morning"" text, one or two 5 minute check-ins throughout the day and a ""good night"". For example, on New Years Eve I was stuck at home alone (parents go to bed early) and asked my girlfriend earlier in the day if she'd like to talk for 5 minutes at midnight. Upon the drop of the ball, I simply receive a ""Happy New Years, I love you"" text, which I reply to asking if she wants to talk and then receive no response for the rest of the night until I said I'm going to bed to which she immediately responds good night. Due to my loneliness, I've tried to arrange some skype sessions or phone calls with her, because it'd be nice to have someone to actually talk to thats not my family, but have had little success. I find that some days I'll ask her if she'd like to have a phone call to which i recieve a ""maybe"" response, only to later find out that she made plans after our conversation to do something with her friends. I've been having trouble finding a way to communicate to her that it would be nice if I were to be able to skype of talk with her at least a few times over break while also trying to give her space to enjoy her time at home. I understand that she's been really busy, it just feels like she's made no efforts to try and talk with me. 

This situation has left me extremely conflicted about my life and my relationships. I know I tend to overthink things a lot when my depression re-emerges but I also find it frustrating that the person with whom I am closest doesn't seem to have a desire to talk to me. I'm hesitant to text some of my friends individually because I've never really had serious depression problems while I've known them and don't know how they'd handle it. I don't know how to cope with this situation I'm in. With graduation and adult life looming for me as well, I find myself anxious, lonely, depressed, and overthinking my entire life. The only friends I have I've made while in college and I will soon moving on from that stage of my life. I know that I'll still be friends with them in the future, but will likely be spread out across the country. I'm nervous that I will continue to have social troubles outside of college in the real world and find myself constantly googling how to make new friends in new places. Loneliness is one of my biggest fears in life and even facing it short term has unleashed a world of problems within me. 

I hope that this ""rant"" isn't too scatterbrained or jumbled, I just wanted to get it off my chest. I'm not sure if any of you have gone through similar situations but I figured I might as well reach out somewhere.

"I always feared people's judgement.  I never wanted to be known as the weird one or the outsider.  I always kept to myself.  No one really bothered me, but no one really cared for me either.  I was in the middle, not bad enough to be hated, not good enough to be loved.  I was content with this position for a while, but it was lonely.  I would always sit at home, while others would go out and actually do things with friends.  I would lament my existence, and question if I was ever good enough.  The truth is I am afraid to just be who I am around people.

I have seen how people treat others who are different.  They can be mean and cruel.  Their avoidance can hurt and damage, and their ridicule can cut and bruise.  I have been on the receiving end of cruelty, and I would rather not go in depth about it.  People don't accept me now, even as docile and non-aggressive as I am, so how would they accept me if I was myself?  I worry they would think I am weird and annoying, even though I don't mean to be at all.  I just want to be accepted and appreciated as I am, but I worry people won't agree with that.",4,"always feared people's judgement.  I never wanted to be known as the weird one or the outsider.

It has made me lose my curiosity for life and all the things within it, understanding how something works, and I hate myself for it, as this have been one of the biggest drives for me in all my life. I could get excited just about a small idea popping in my head. Today no ideas are floating, my brain is empty, meds, depression or just myself? Even if some idea comes up I immediately put it down, because why bother? It won't work and if it does someone has already made something which is 100 times better than my solution...

"I finally got the time to post this, I've been opening the submit page for a while but I couldn't just do it. I need to get this off my chest.

It's been a real hell for me since 2 years when my mother died and I am forced to live and get tortured by my stepfather but since December, I feel like I've been going through much worse things now. 

I'm already suffering enough from horrible family abuse, death of my mother, finding out the hard and sad truth who were my real parents, social anxiety and losing nearly all of my friends, but I've been now also suffering quite alot at college.

I'm getting nearly constantly bullied by my groupmates since the first week of college. I've been called names, humiliated infront of others, including teachers, even physically hit couple of times. I've tried to ignore them and report them to our teacher, but that did do nothing, only if anything, my teacher also made fun of me and believed their rumour about me infront of the group. Other groupmates won't do anything about it either because they all know each other. Some of the bullies are even bullying me together so I can't do so much about it, they also keep bullying teachers too and have the worst grades ever.

I almost literally have no friends in college, except few guys and they betrayed me too. It's so hard for me to have great grades when you're basically alone all the time without any help at all.

In the last day when we were on practice, they refused to work with me and they shamed me the whole day, I didn't get to do anything at practice at all because of them, that made me so hopeless in myself and I don't feel motivated to improve practing after this at all. 

It's really hard for me to live with my stepfather who often emotineally abuses me alot and tried to kick me out of home once, with a family that tried to commit me into mental hospital in a sick way, without friends and being constantly bullied in college. I feel like giving up anytime soon and accept my fate if nothing changes.

The only game that makes me feel better for awhile is Life is Strange. It has alot of situations which hit me home and I would relate to them so hard, making me feel better feeling that I'm not alone. Also the game mainly is about friendship, Max, Chloe and Rachel are really great friends and I've had these kind of friends before I lost them unfortunately. Actually felt I wasn't alone while playing this masterpiece game.

I wish one day I wouldn't wake up to stop suffering like this forever everyday.

"Hey everyone, I'm Jake and I'm 23 years old. I'm already started to give on my life now since September and i don't care about my life because its shitty, i have 2 speech impediments, no girls talk go me in school or anywhere, etc. I have so much anxiety and depression that Im losing my mind lately, plus I'm not eating enough and sleeping enough too because i don't feel like eating alot because i feel so upset at just everything in my life. I'm never happy anymore at all and i don't feel like living at times now too because of my problems while other peoples have fun in college, have friends and get married in a few years and have kids ,etc. My cousin just got engaged and most of my cousins are in relationships. I have a Speech Impediment called Verbal Apraxia with Stuttering which i had my whole life since i was born . i only had one relationship for almost 3 years in the past. I have been very depressed lately because i don't have a girlfriend like my twin brother and some cousins and friends that i have. i have good social skills because my nick name is the mayor Jake everywhere i go because i know and talk to everyone but i never talk to girls due to problems listed in this post.

I have some social anxiety too which makes me super scared to talk to girls because of my Verbal Apraxia with the stutter and it makes me very depressed. As i type this I'm having alot of anxiety and I'm about have a panic/anxiety attack too, when i have anxiety i have irrational thoughts like people are out to get me and other things like that . i feel like no girls will like me or give me a chance because of it if i approach them in real life because i can't even say my name correctly. when i talk, it sounds like a moderate deaf person and i hate it so much all of my life. Also i used tinder which my twin brother met his girlfriend on and have no luck even after many dates with different girls, now i am getting more depressed to the point of crying and not going out of the house too at times. My family is not the greatest at times too.I live with my mom and grandmother who makes everyone crazy which includes me. Every girl i talk to on tinder stop talking to me within a few replies too so i don't have idea what to do now too like what am i doing wrong? but my friend said i suck talking to girls too so im trying to improve that right now.

Lately I'm thinking I'm ugly too which i kinda believe that i am ugly because no girls like me while my family and other people says I'm not ugly. also I'm in community college so I'm missing the college experience of staying on campus making friends and meeting girls like everyone else is at my age because of my grades and possibly future degree in funeral directing. I am at home doing the online program for funeral directing while  All my cousins and my brother and everyone at my age  went away to college and im home missing out on everything when you stay at college like meeting girls and parties Also i live at home too that doesn't help me in meeting girls unlike everyone at college campuses. Im too scared to approach any girls because of my speech problems because I'm afraid of them not understanding me. i just can't do it due to anxiety because of my speech impediments and afraid of getting rejected. Also some of my anxiety is from school too because I'm very behind in my classes as of today because I have no motivation to do it because of how i feel sick almost all the time from all of my anxiety and depression too. Also due to all of this, i just got a new gym membership to go with my guy friends and i used it a couple times then i stopped going with them because i feel like my speech impediments make me awkward around girls and people . all my life i felt like people say things to pretend so i think they understand me sometimes. I only have 3-10 male friends while every other guy have female friends and stuff at my age. I don't know where to start or what to do at this point in time because i tried Tinder and that didn't worked for me. Plus when i message girls on tinder, they almost never respond back. i can talk to guys easily and other people easily but not attractive girls at all , let alone approaching girl to get their numbers.i can see myself being forever alone because of my speech impediments.Also i have been in speech therapy too for a long time when i was little and I'm not in it now. So i need help and advice right now from my fellow Redditors Thanks for your help and advice everyone !

tl;dr:i have Verbal Apraxia with stuttering which are speech impediments and i can't talk to girls due to the fear of not being understood and rejected of my speech impediments. Im scared of being forever alone while my friends and everyone is married and have kids in a few years while I'm not. To be honest, I'm almost 100% sure most girls will not date me because of my speech impediments and have a family. . What should i do at this point in time? Also should i try to approach and talk to girls that i like ? Because i want to over come this fear of talking to girls because i think they will not like me of my speech impediment.

Edit- Iâm getting  regular therapy weekly  now, also Iâm seeing the same therapist that I saw years ago when I was younger too and im going to the gym too now. I made a  tinder account too this week but almost every girl that i talk to stops talking to me or never respond to my first message.

"I got out of the army last year three months before I turned twenty eight and moved back into my mom and stepdads place because my credit was still ruined and I was still in debt from eight years earlier... because of my mom and stepdad. It's a long story and I won't go into detail but they stole money from me when I was twenty and it forced me into what seems to have been a perpetual road of nonstop failure and deep, deep, *deep* self loathing.

I injured myself in the army and got a nice chunk of permanent disability, making me set for the rest of my life. This is nice and all, but this wasn't my goal. I wanted to do my job in the army but no one ever elevated me. I wasn't hated either. That's the part I don't get. It seemed like everyone liked me but no one ever put even one extra second of effort to elevate me further. I watched everyone else get ahead as my physical state deteriorated and after four years, realizing I was going nowhere and was never going to get the qualifications to do my job on the inside or outside, opted for the medboard option.

When I got out I moved back home with my mom, stepdad, stepbrother and blood brother in a five bedroom prefab home because my credit still wasn't fixed, and what I saw enraged me. 

My mother had put on two hundred pounds, already weighing a sturdy four hundred. She'd sat in the same spot watching TV for the entire time I was in the army. My mom no longer abused me emotionally or physically but now she was doing this to my autistic stepbrother. She berated him daily. Even worse is that my stepdad was too wimpy to stop it and forked my mom over thousands upon thousands of dollars so she could buy fake little business licenses and crap off Amazon for the sole purpose of making sure no one else got my stepdads money... except for my brother.

I love my brother. He is my most prized person and we grew up together, but my mom has simply paid for him to sit on his ass and smoke weed, turning his mediocre hobby into a job with a whopping thirty thousand dollar ""loan"". I've never been treated this way. Since I was fourteen it was ""get a job"" while my brother was allowed to sit around and smoke weed while I busted my ass during all the best years of my life.

We lived out on eighty six acres and my mom wanted the land clear cut for some sort of farming operation, one of her hair brained schemes. It takes lots of time, money and machinery to clear cut eight six acres. She expected me to do it for free, by hand and with an axe. I said no.

At some point I began buying my own tools and storing them in the shed and would use them on and off again. Slowly I noticed they'd simply disappear. One day, when my mom thought I was gone, I watched her waddle into the shed, take a handful of my tools, walk them into the woods and toss them somewhere I could never find them. She'd toss my axes into the truck with the trash pile and take them to the dumpster. Nothing had changed. She was still hell bent on destroying my property and due to my credit I couldn't even get my own place. After three or four months of drinking, I broke and went to rehab.

I wound up moving in with my girlfriend. I won't badmouth her but we drifted apart during the army and she never got me on the lease, instead inviting a random girl to live with us who couldn't pay rent. Because I had no say, and things had fallen apart between us, it ended after a month and a half.

I moved back to a friend's uncle's place and for three months I got my finances in order. During this time I met up with a girl I'd known since middle school and had always had a crush on. Things went great. Our first date was awesome but she made it clear she was celibate and wanted to get married before having sex. It was annoying but like I said, I'd known her since middle school.

We dated for three months. Not like we were going out as girlfriend and boyfriend but going places and having deep discussions about our future lives together. Ya know, all that sappy relationship stuff.

We finally went on our final date and she invited her friend. The date was awesome... until her friend got drunk. We went camping for three days and on day three I assume her friend saw the attention she was paying to me and cut a nice wedge between us and berated me for hours. It wasn't anything I couldn't handle but sometime around midnight I fucking exploded after she made up another story and called me out for something that I wasn't even lying about. That night I asked the girl I was dating if this was worth pursuing and she crawled out of our tent and into her friends. She later claimed she was drunk and thought I made a move on her but it was worse than that, she'd had a boyfriend the entire time and was intentionally friend zoning me and hadnt expected me to find out if this was worth my time. 

It gets worse than that though, there was absolutely nothing between us, at least on her end. She hadn't been attracted to me one single bit. Even worse is that during our falling out discussion, she wouldn't even admit she had a boyfriend, I had to find out later through friends and hearsay. The last time I spoke to her she just cut me off for admitting how I felt and being upset but she never blocked or deleted me from Facebook. She just saw my messages for a month and would occasionally reply with a snippy one word answer until I blew up and forced her to block me. THIS finally seems to have broken me. A month or two earlier she talked me into getting an apartment on a year lease so we could have somewhere to hang out when she was in my neck of the woods, so now I'm fucking stuck with an apartment until August, in a part of town I moved to because I could find a free place to stay until I was able to get back on my feet, where I only know a small handful of people.

I am using my GI bill to go back to college and maybe I'll find some purpose and a woman to live my life with, but everyone my age is married with two kids and a house. I missed out on the entirety of my twenties, and blew it with a girl I'd known since the sixth grade and felt totally fucking berated. I haven't bothered to find anyone or make friends or even to make eye contact with anyone lately and have relapsed multiple times.

I just want to take my meager army money and buy land and be a fucking hermit and live the rest of my life wondering about what could have been if I'd been raised better by loving and hard working parents, or had opportunity, or had someone say ""you're next in line for success and great things"", but none of that happened. I don't think it's because I'm hated, because people genuinely seem to like me, but that's it. I'm just that guy with the pearly smile who's fun to talk to but nothing more. 

On a final note, I will say this. I got out of the army and I remembered how social I was *before* I joined, but once I got out I saw how everyone had moved on or had burned out. I'm in purgatory. Im somewhere between success and failure. I'll never hit rock bottom because my body gave out under the strain of army life, but I'll never make more than I work for in an entrepreneurial manner. I've thought about opening a bar or something like that but I've been denied a home loan and VA business loan so many times that it's now affecting my credit despite only having one tiny and insignificant debt left.

It doesn't matter I guess. I'm boring, I'm bored and I don't know what to do and the world has moved on from when I was young.

"Just a quick rant about my problems to make me feel better and get some weight off my chest. Each paragraph is sorta itâs own thing.

Iâm almost 16, in high school, getting over losing a girl I love(d) because she cheated on me a while back and was really toxic even though we were crazy for each other. Iâm actually doing okay though. Thatâs not my worst problem.

I have it really good. My family makes really good money, super stable job, nice little cozy home, never moved, happily married parents that I have great relationships with and I get privileges like being born a tall white male in the suburbs/country in the best country in the world but yet Iâm not happy.

Itâs not that Iâm sad, I just feel numb to things. I donât get a feeling like my brainâs active and happy. Is this what depression is? I feel dry and stale. 

My health is bad. Iâm a type 1 diabetic; ever since I was 6 and ever since Iâve been a teen itâs been really out of control. Itâs fucking with me mentally and the constant high blood sugar does physical things to mess with your mood too. 

Because of my diabetes I canât do the only thing Iâve ever been good and passionate about, be a marine. Itâs entirely off the table. It feels really hard having this sometimes. But I think about how I could have cancer or HIV while starving in Africa as an orphan with no education and it just makes me feel like a pussy. Pride and integrity are important to me but I really do just feel shitty all the time and feeling bad just makes me feel bad so I feel worse and so on.

I feel so numb and like, hyper aware and lacking of those good chemicals in your brain. My whole life I always wanted to go hunting. The first time I ever killed a deer it was a great experience on paper, but I felt like I was acting being happy the whole time. I didnât feel much excitement and it broke my heart. I wanted to be out there with everything in me, but it was like I had played this level of the game over and over, even though it was entirely new and âexcitingâ.

I hate school. Itâs where I get all of my social interaction, sure, but in reality itâs a horrible attempt to teach on a massive scale, and itâs like a holocaust for young mental health. Iâm smart but I feel like my brain cut me off 100 steps up a 1,000 step mountain. I feel unmotivated and limited to what I know I can do. I used to be a really good student and this year I literally just donât do anything even though Iâm in the upper level classes.

And even if I did great in school, whatâs it for? I donât feel interested in doing much else. 

I would never hurt myself in anyway. But I really do wonder what Iâm living for sometimes; even though other times I canât fathom how Iâd feel that way, and I force myself to be positive and like myself and feel a little better.

I donât like myself. My hair is really bad and I canât fix it really, I think Iâm gonna go bald, I just donât like my face much, I hate complaining about this this shit and feeling bad in my situation.

"Hi everyone! 

So I realized my depression is better at home, when I can be with my dogs. Thatâs partially because I have to take care of them. 

The thing is, at school, I canât really have any pets- and Iâm graduating soon which means I canât have a new one right now. I wonât be stable. 

So I got a cactus! Iâve never really taken care of a plant before so Iâve decided it was easy enough. I have an app and she has a name- so hopefully this works.

"Hi guys, I might need some help.

I'm dangerously close to becoming a full alcoholic. Whenever I feel down, i grab the bottle. Sometimes I get drunk 3 times a week, the minimum is 2, but sometimes it's even 6 times a week. Just got out of an 11 day drinking binge.
I'm only 18, I can't let the booze take over. My friends and I joke about, just because they don't know the extent of the problems and I'm too pussy to tell them.
I just feel so much better when I'm drunk. I am smarter, more social, don't think about my problems as much (until an hour after the last glass, then the depression really hits hard.). 
I just always feel like I have wasted the last 18 years of my life. I have litteraly nothing to be proud of. It hits hardest when my friends asked what I've done all day, and I just have nothing to say.
So whenever I'm down, I'll get drunk, knowing I'll feel better for a while.

The depression itself isn't that bad, it's not always there. I feel perfect half the time. Dunno if it's even a real depression.

Took half an hour just writing this, as I can't type correctly anymore, so I have to write the whole thing basically three times to make it correct.

"Finally going to therapy for some long-standing issues. Iâm pretty sure Iâve been in a low-key state of depression for the majority of the last 3 years. Iâve been going to therapy now for 3 months. However, Iâm not sure if things are going the way they should be as Iâve never done it before, and have nothing to compare it to. 


**Here are some âprosâ  about my therapist:** 


- Specializes in my issues

- Good listener

- Empathetic 

- Takes my insurance so itâs pretty affordable 

- I am comfortable being vulnerable around her and telling her everything


**Here are some things I find questionable. Please help me decide if this is normal:**


- Only took notes during the first session (Iâm not sure if she takes notes after the session or not)

- No homework or things to work on. When I asked if there was something more I could do about a certain thought pattern, she said I was already doing it just by going to therapy. End of story. 

- No direction or check-ins. I do 99% of the talking. She never directs the conversation or checks-in about stuff we have talked about. She waits for me to initiate all talk. If I spent the entire session talking about some silly tv show I saw, she wouldnât direct it back towards anything. 

- Her responses to almost everything are âhow do you feel as you are saying that?â Or âthere are a lot of layers to your pain.â 

- Not sure that Iâm making progress towards anything. It all just feels like Iâm unburdening to a third-party. I don't feel better after my sessions and I don't feel like I've gotten any better. 

- I have twice asked her if I should be on antidepressants. Both times, she seemed reluctant to even talk about it. We left off both times with me being no more clear about whether or not I should pursue this, how to go about getting a prescription (can she do it? Do I go to my family doctor? Either way, she never gave me my options or how to move forward)


If this is normal to therapy, Iâm happy to continue going.

For two years I have been actively self harming whether it was cutting or doing other bad stuff. I had friends that tried to help but I could never get myself to stop. 

Recently I found myself in a really positive relationship and because I love my boyfriend, I agreed to give him my blades and he promised he would keep them out of reach. I did this because I feel okay knowing they still exist even if I can't get to them. I could never get myself to throw them away.

But now I am so utterly depressed. Cutting was my unhealthy outlet but I relied on it to feel better. Now I don't have any way to release or at least nothing that equates to self injury.

I'm 24 in college and I live about an hour away.  I come home nearly every holiday, because when I was living at home during community college she became very dependent on me(to do household chores, and support her emotionally). 

She's lost her white collar job about a year ago.  She make some bad choices, transferred to a position that wasn't right for her, and got let go.  Now she's working at a warehouse job that too physical for her(out of shape).  I'm worried that her depression is getting worse and worse.  I can't quit college to move back and take care of her.

"HI there everyone. This is extremly long, I want to finally ~wake up~ , so, if you don't have free time, don't read. Sorry If I let my emotions to take over my writing.

 This is the first time I open myself like this, to a bigger community or a larger group. First of all, I'm 15, young, ain't I. I don't think age matters, anyway. My life so far was and is pretty rought. My mother died when I was 7, because of cancer. Even though I was young, I wasn't stupid. I knew what happen when I was called at my school ~office~ or whatever it is called to be told. 

One of my friends mom adopted us. By us, I mean my brother and my sister. She is one of the best and most powerfull pearsons I know. She already had a daughter and was divorced. We had to move, 2 times, because of some issues with the rent. She and fought and is fighting, in a way or another for us. She is the reason why me and my sister have a roof above our heads right now. She took a part of an old building, raised it from nothing, without anyone helping her, just a women, alone. She renovated and âupgradedâ the interior of the house. 

Years and years later, my brother left us. Just because he's ~different~ and has another sexual orientation discussion starter to occur. He left, found someone who he loves, and, lives happily, in a way or another. I'm happy that he found his way, but I could never understand why he left.

I was a pretty mediocre and am, talentless and a bother. My way of being it's like, helping the others, and disappearing. After I know the pearson is good, I want to fade, but I can't, because they attach.

My stepmother family is pretty fucked up in the head. One has drinking problems, and her mother and her sister. Oh god, they are the worst. None shows their real face, only after a while, that's one leason I learned after so many years. We had our updown in family, but everything is their fault, for jabing into our lives.

Here, in my country, and in my city, the salary isn't worth anything. That's why she went in another country, actually found someone, found the PERFECT job for her, but, with that the problems came.

Since she is far and her job can't allow it, she can come two or three times home. I don't have a problem with it, I know how much she was struggeling with this dumb life in this country, and I'm happy she can finally start her life, it's never late.

But I'm alone, with my sister. She's an adult, she can take care of me, that's not the problem here. She had some job problems, was thrown out, and because of that, money issues came in. Money, after money, after money. That isn't such a big issue, or that's what anyone would think. Apparently it is, in this dammed family, they are all judging, throwing her, disrespecting her and ~spitting~ on her.

She was on the merge of suicide so many times, but she can't do such thing, because I'm still in her life. She still fights for me, otherwise she would be gone a long time ago. Since we went throught a lot, we aren't the type to show our affection, our love, and like all the people, make mistakes. We love our stepmother, she did what many can't do, but we feel like we are thrash, and want to die, both of us.

Since my stepmother is far, and I don't know why this is happening, she can't control her life alone, not anymore. She let's other pearsons, like her mom, and the idiot that she found, but unfourtunately loves, dig in, they are making the decision for her, and that hurts. We love her, but we are being constantly ~stabbed~, because of her blindness.

Whatever we say is put against us, we are being gossiped by them, thrown on the window, disrespected, literally thrashed by her family. That hurts, and I'm on the merge of totally giving up. We've been fighting, resisting, but it hurts like hell.

My sister found her love, but, because of the fact that he is a gypsy, they all judge her. She doesn't know what to do anymore, in order to reconcile both sides, she can't do anything, because nothing is enough or good for them, they are a bunch of incompetents. Judging her over and over, when that men helped us more than they did. That's just stupidity. 

We've been hurt, over and over. Now I understand why our brother left, because of this family.

After I grew up, I found myself in a depression. An extremely severe one. I can't get out, I found amazing people but, because of the doings of my own hands, I lost them. I lost a her that she helped me for an entire year, because I'm a liar and lazy pearson. I want help but I don't want them to get in, because they will feel bad, my situation will completely ruin their happiness. So I found myself sad, depressed, talentless. The only things I have left are my dogs, which I love the most on this planet. From three, I was left with two, and god knows when, with one. I feel like the power I have left is with my dogs, but, when they will be gone same I will. I want to disappear, completely. That was I will end my suffering and make this family realize what the hell they did wrong the whole time. My stepmother is great, did amazing things, but one thing she didn't gave us was love and affection.

I'm spending nights playing, school isn't going that great, I have another way of thinking and I really don't bother with it. I just, can't. Playing and spending my days on PC, even though I don't want to. I want to have a talent, to grow up and save everyone that in my situation, to grow up as an artist, singer, anything. I just want a talent.

I drew a long time ago, lost my talent because of the lack of motivation and depression. Started guitar alone, but don't have the motivation because I feel like I'm a failure. 

A long story, and I'm thanking you all who reached this part, you are amazing just by spending time reading. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I'm depressed, I'm thinking of things a 15 shouldn't, thinking of suicide nowadays, because of the situation we are in, thinking so much, being dead inside and having a huge gap in my hearth because of the things I lost so far, and because I can't do anything proper.

I need help, what should I do in order to change myself, I'm just at the begging of life and thinking of ending it. I hate this world and everything around it, because I was raised with hatred and ~fights~. I want help, to cure my deep depression, to regain my happiness, to see the world colorfull again, I want to be normal, again. What can I do, nothing motivates me and nothing makes me happy anymore.

Some backstory:
I'm currently attending college.
I have a body focused repetitive disorder that popped up around early high school and has since been a lot better. I've always been a bit on the depressed side since middle school with low self esteem. 



One reccuring thing is in certain situations I become very stressed (?) to the point where my mind just digs itself into a hole of despair and I have episodes of just crying and feeling extremely awful. Most recently, I've been triggered by my boyfriend.


At first it was just arguments over random things we disagreed on and slowly the crying episodes came on. Eventually I think it's just instances of him being mad at things I don't do on purpose but are sometimes wrong and me feeling so bad about myself that I get into that mind space and can't get out. He thinks of them as tantrums and doesn't know how to deal with or help with them. 


Even at home, when I think too much I focus on all the bad and this happens again. I start doubting my relationship because of all the bad stuff, I start feeling bad about my life etc.



For the most part I really like my relationship. Outside of the arguments we fit together really well. He's very sweet and caring. 


Does anyone know what I might be experiencing and how to fix it?

"Today I finally got the strength to finally get help with my depression.  Still trying to figure out the logistics of when my first appointment will be with the doctor but Iâm proud I am taking a step in the right direction.

I think my slide into depression the last 6 months is from the loss of my dad as well as some other personal issues (hated my job/fallout with some friends/bad breakup) but it took 6+ months after all that for me to finally realize I needed help. I was sleeping in, just watching tv/playing Xbox and avoiding my friends at times when I started to feel anxious.  I started becoming more and more of a recluse but at this point Iâm done with this feeling.

I have gotten a new job and mentioned to my boss that I might need to show up an hour late on Fridays for my therapy.  She couldnât have been more understanding and supportive of it.  I was nervous as hell to tell her but glad I did (depression hasnât effected my work, in a weird way itâs the one part of my life I have felt empowered/productive).

Sorry for this rambling but I am only posting this to hopefully encourage others to do the same.  I know everyoneâs depression is different you can get help.  I also know I have a ways to go and this is only a small baby step.

I have been lurking at this page lately and have been moved by the posts Iâve seen. I hope everyone here finds happiness soon, and I know thatâs not easy.  ",4," the loss of my dad as well as some other personal issues ,hated my job,fallout with some friends,bad breakup"
"I finally went out to do something with my few friends. I've had a crush on one of them for at least 3 years and one of my other friends that knew was also asking a girl out there and said I should ask the one I liked as well. 

I was really scared because I've never had a girlfriend and the one time I asked someone I was rejected and I'm terrible at speaking to people and I just freeze up when I get nervous which was definitely happening now. I tried to talk to her and of course I froze up and made everything awkward and ruined everything. 

Every time I try to do something I screw it up. I feel like I'm not good at anything. My dad and step-mom don't take me seriously. They say I'm lazy because I never do anything but I'm afraid because every time I leave my room I mess something up. I can't make food, can't socialize, video games aren't fun to me anymore because I hate playing alone, I tried skating but I don't have money to buy new equipment and all I have is a tiny Penny board that my feet are too big for, my family expects me to have high grades because I used too be considered the smart one but my grades have fallen so now the one thing I was considered good at is gone and I keep disappointing everyone, the one family member I have that truly loves me is in prison because of an assault charge and everyone in my family hates her, and now I've probably lost another one of my few friends because I can't do anything right.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't really want to live but I know I'm not going to commit suicide. I've thought about it but I'm too scared and I don't want to hurt my mom more than she already is. I don't know why I'm posting this.

"I never knew my father he left before i was born. My mother told me he started a charity for boys without father's after he left that and his first name is all i know about him. Four years ago my mom and stepfather made a move overseas from my home country. The transition has been difficult i feel alienated and haven't made any friends for four years other than brief online relationships.

Unfortunately the move also took me out of school past the age of 13 i haven't had an education. My mom is to busy to maintain homeschool and my stepdad doesn't care for me as he does my mom. I was born in another country and he already has two children of his own I guess this is why he doesn't pay attention to me.

It's hard being alone or feeling that way I've always wanted to meet someone my own age I dream of it. Some days i wake up and I'll sneak out of the house to the park and hope to meet someone. I haven't yet. My 18th birthday is happening this year and that's a big number to me but I'm afraid nothing is going to change its like I'm stuck in a purgatory while everyone else gets to go to school and have friends get a job.

"I don't think I've typed here much.. but it's probably going to be my second or third time.
Many years ago I was into a long distance relationship that started with a solid friendship in 2010. After years this guy from Mexico left and  I spent years alone, literally crying until falling asleep. That left in me some serious trust issues. Years later in 2016 I started talking to a guy from Texas. He had gone through a lot of stuff and I felt like I could help him. Things were going right, we were friends and started a long distance relationship I loved. The problem is that he stated changing and we were arguing a lot. My trust issues didn't help either. I became too demanding and he kept ignoring me. One day I broke up with him and I was an idiot thinking he would try to get me back but he didn't. I found out he had someone else. Another long distance relationship. It killed me. I thought he was gone, but during all 2017 he has been typing, sending messages and telling me that he would leave her at some point and would come back because he loves me. He told me he doesn't love her and tried to break up with her (that was true, but she said she was going to kill herself if he leaves her) so he stayed with her. A week ago I got so mad at him for his decision of staying with her that I insulted him. I called him a coward, an idiot and much more. My temper doesn't help much either.
He replied and said he didn't care about me anymore and he blocked me everywhere. I can't sleep. I can't eat, I can't live. 

I think I fucked up and lost the only guy who ever showed some interest in me. I'm dumb, kind of nerd, not pretty and stupid. I don't think I'll get anyone else in probably years since I only had two relationships (both long distance ones) and I had to wait like 3 years for the next one to happen. (the last one I had) 
I think I am doomed to die alone.

"We had a rough day. 

You know, when you and your significant other argue. Those types of days.

But what happens when you think she's lost trust in you? It's a worse feeling than some of you think.

Maybe then, that's not necessarily a bad day. Some people have it worse. Even I know that. 

But sometimes it turns into something a little worse.

The truth was, was that I hadn't been talking to anyone else. I had swore up and down that I hadn't been, I mean, she was on vacation and I had promised to always be faithful.

And I had been. She just didn't understand the real truth that I had been telling her. She wouldn't believe me. 

I made bad decisions. This seems simple to anyone else who'd be reading this.

We argued some more. She blocked me right before I had gone to shower and that's right around when I realized some things.

I realized that I was a bad boyfriend, although I had always been faithful and loyal.

A bad friend.

Moments later, I could feel that familiar pattern of water patting on my back as it does every night right after my usual 5 hour shifts, every day.

Zoning out, I kept realizing why some people hurt themselves.

Why people killed themselves.

Sometimes the sky is grey much more than it is blue.

Maybe it was people like me. Maybe I was a bad person after all.

"This is a throw away account.

I have never been in a relationship with someone and never had sex or sexual contact with anyone either. I know that isn't really a HORRIBLE thing at all. But I am starting to wonder why?

Story: The only guy I have attracted to a possible relationship has severe depression and general anxieties disorder. He is kind of a shut-in and plays videogames and does drugs when he is not working. That's the extent of his life that I am aware of. I have known him for a few years and at some points durng those years were very close and talked about getting into a serious relationship. At some points, he called me his girlfriend but we never have been REALLY at that point. He used to tell me that he cared about me a lot. He would go through depressive phases and disappear sometimes. When he came back it was always the same. ""I'm sorry, I'm not a good person, I'm bad at relationships, I want to die, etc"".

I still try to get through to him even now. He ignores me or tries to set up a hook-up date and then pretty much just blows me off anyway.

I'm starting to wonder less about him and more about me. My friends say that he is not capable of a relationship and it is not a reflection of my worth that he is not receprocating my feelings. But at the same time... if this is all I can get, is this a reflection of me? Am I depressed because I am alone... or am I alone because I am depressed?

Will getting into a relationship with someone make me feel any better? I used to think that I could help him by showering him with my affection and attention. I used to think that if he did this to me, I would feel better and everything would be solved.

For some reason, I think this is foolish now. Maybe it's just growing through the attachment and coming out from the other side in hindsight. Maybe it's just getting tired of him not liking me back. I don't know.

I feel like there is a connection between being alone and being depressed though. I feel like if I would have some thing or someone to support me, I would be more likely to overcome or be motivated to overcome other things. I know that's weak. I just get exhausted and lonely sometimes. Going through all my life without anyone has really been difficult but I'm not trying to whine about it, please don't think that.",4,He ignores me or tries to set up a hook-up date and then pretty much just blows me off anyway

"Hi, I've had pretty bad depression and anxiety issues since i was in middle school and have pretty much hated myself ever since i can remember. I'm also an introvert and generally cant stand to be around people other than a select few. I Went to a therapist early in highschool who said i had some form of depression, but my parents never really followed through getting any medication for me (i dont think they really believe depression is a problem). I've been in a pretty huge slump since I've been out of high school (almost 4 years) compounded by the fact that just recently my best friend decided he would check out early. I want to get some professional help before things get any worse. I have a job and insurance but not a lot of money. I am not suicidal (i guess i was up until recently and i found out how bad being on the other end feels), but now that this is no longer an option i feel like i am just trapped in a 100 foot hole with no way out. 

Really i am posting because i have questions i am hoping to have answered by anyone with experience on the subject.

1. Is a general practice doctor usually someone who can prescribe anti depressants? Im not sure my insurance would cover any sort of mental health doctor.(i generally hate doctors and pharmaceuticals and avoid both at all costs, hopefully until now as i cant really see any other resolution)
2. How do i know if they(drugs) would even help? Any particular  ""feelings"" they prevent? 
3. Do they help with anxiety or would that be something else? 
4. Do they affect you physically? (Weight gain/loss, energy, ect.)
5. Generally speaking are any of the pharmaceuticals i might be prescribed expensive?

"Since I don't really know where to start, might as well go with the grief portion and build outwards.

My mother died almost a year ago now. We're a small family, me an only child, and I am very lucky to have a close relationship with my parents, my mom especially. She has always been the type to 'mom' me and she was an emotional support that I never truly appreciated.

Her death was sudden and unexpected because, as she did, she hid her own issues from me to lessen my burden. I still remember getting the call out of nowhere and my world crashing around me. While I am blessed with an amazing extended family, it's just Dad and me to carry on and he doesn't really get it. His go-to is dark humour which I frankly can't handle and I don't know if I ever will. He is also much more prepared for this, having known my mom was struggling as she was. He also doesn't understand mental illness, specifically depression, except to say that I should try being happier.

Which leads to the other side of this wombo-combo. I'm in a new city for school and the fall before my mom died, my only circle of friends (who also happen to be my co-workers) cast me out in a spectacular gaslighting endeavor that destroyed any self-confidence I had. I was told things I felt going on around me were all in my head, that I was imagining tension that wasn't there, and I should just chill.

Fast-forward to 2 days before my mom died and I get a request to meet from one of the more vocal of the group. I was on the phone with my mom, the last phone call I would ever have with her, and told her I had to go meet with this person. In that meeting, I'm told that everything I thought was going on, was actually going on (contrary to the months of gaslighting prior) and that I'm essentially a terrible person who deserved it. But, this person was willing to show me mercy and permit me to re-join this circle on the condition that I change everything about my personality.

I was so lonely, so isolated, that I consented. I began to believe the lies about how horrible I was and within 24 hours, I was on the floor of my apartment, crying and trying to determine the best way to end my life because I saw no reason for a worthless, horrible person like myself to exist. I had decided to go get a knife when the phone rang with an unexpected call from a friend back home which broke through my thoughts long enough to break the cycle in my head.

I wrote to our collective supervisor about the situation and went to lay down as I was having intense chest pain. The next day, I woke up and my mother had died of heart failure/heart attack (we didn't have an autopsy done).

So here I am, back in my isolation. My supervisor has ignored my repeated attempts to bring this issue to light as the situation has not improved at work at all in the last year. I've hidden myself away in my apartment, and I feel like I'm dying inside.

I have so much guilt over cutting my phone call short with my mom to deal with this insane mind game. I have anger over these people stealing my energy from what's important. I still feel worthless for being unable to get past this. I just feel so much pain. I wish with all my being my mom was still here and I feel like I'm disappointing her by being unable to get my life back on track. I feel as though I'm drowning on the inside and no matter who I tell or what I say, all I hear is that 'you can do this' or 'just stay positive'. I am positive, and I can be positive, but that doesn't help when my depression sets in and my heart is breaking. I just want someone to actually hear me when I say how much agony I am carrying inside.",4,"death was sudden and unexpected because, as she did, she hid her own issues from me to lessen my burden"
"I'm really rock-bottom at the moment. I'm seeking therapy, I have great friends and family who I hear from every few days, but no matter what: I feel isolated and I just don't want to bother anyone. Desperate for human contact, feeling included, loved, etc.

Is this reasonable? Should I reach out to some friends, even though I am in constant need for that kind of interaction at the moment? I just can't stand being alone.",4,"feel isolated and I just don't want to bother anyone, Desperate for human contact, feeling included"

"I don't even know how I feel, I think I might be sad, but even then I usually know when I'm sad. Right now I've just felt numb and disconnected for a few days. I have a girlfriend who loves me, awesome friends, a relatively low stress life, and I even have creative outlets. But, recently (like a week), I haven't been able to write anything, I haven't talked to any of my friends, and I have a ton of trouble even talking with my girlfriend because... I don't even fucking know, I don't know why any of this is like it is. I want to write, I want to write all the time, but I just goddamn can't. I want to talk to my friends and hang out with them but I just fucking don't. I want to be with my girlfriend and hold her and kiss her and tell her I love her but everything I do feels shallow and pointless even when I'm with her. What the fuck is wrong with me?

edit: it's fucking 2 am and I'm not sleeping, even though I have work tomorrow at 7. I don't know why, I'm just not getting into bed. I know I should, I know I need sleep, but for some reason I'm just not getting in bed. I'm tired, I'm just fucking not.

"Why can't I accept reality and just come to terms with the fact the girl I want doesn't want me. Even starting to think she's playing with me. From the random texts she sends with hearts, to the pics she'll send, the calls, the time she told me she would've been with me if she knew I liked her all those years ago. Maybe it was when she told me she'll be with me eventually or that she called me her future man.. Or maybe the most likely thing is I'm to easily hung up on a girl I'll never actually be with.

Should I take responsibility for my own mental caught ups cuz it feels wrong to just say it was her. But come on how can a girl like that, as beautiful as a painting of roses would be with me.. She loves him.. She loves her boyfriend of 2 years and there's nothing I can do about that. She loves a man who abuses her in every way possible. And while I'm wondering if his physical abuse is worse than his mental and verbal abuse, you're in love with him and refuse to leave him. So why fill my head with a false reality as if we'll run away together. Why does it hurt so much when you jokingly told me to chill out with wanting to be with you. I just can't understand why you choose to be abused rather than be with me.

I can't get you out my head but why would I want to. My reason for smiling is my reason for depression lately. I want to quit you like a smoking habit but every time I get a little message with a heart at the end from you I can't help myself. I've known you for so long and yet I couldn't see this coming at all. I know I'm a fool, I know I shouldn't get so mad that you love your abuser, I know I should just move on but I just can't. You are what I want and I know in my mind I probably won't ever have you, and that I'm getting going played like a goddamn violin either for your fun or worse.. But it hurts and I know it hurts so much because I'm a fool who can't get what he wants",4," She loves a man who abuses her in every way possible.

"I recently started dating my Deaf friend and she opened right up to me about how she had depression and contemplated suicide a few years ago.

She says she felt like a burden to the people around her.  Having to learn a new language just to talk to her, not listening to her because they donât understand her voice, and not wanting to communicate with her at all.

We watched a movie the other day at my house and she fell asleep on my chest.  I rolled up her sleeve because it was getting caught on my watch, and I saw a massive amount of old scars on her left arm.  I pulled her sleeve right down and just thought for a second.  Iâve never seen her without a long sleeve shirt or a coat on.  Even though Iâve been one of her closest friends for years.  She obviously cuts herself, or used to cut herself as the case may be. 



She has apparently been feeling heaps better recently so thats great, she says she learnt to smile, and that she learnt there are people that care for her.   And I believe her. 


But what if this happens again?  What if she has another rough trot?  What am I to do, I feel like I wonât be enough to stop her.

Even if she is past this, Iâm worried.

Is it normal to be worried?

"This is my first post and I wanted to know if I could get some advice on this issue Iâm having. Just a little back story of myself: Iâve have depression and anxiety for 10 years after the loss of a parent at 14 but never sought immediate treatment. Last year was when I was official diagnosed. But anyways, 2017 was a really rough year for my anxiety and depression, as Iâm sure others can probably empathize, and I kept experiencing one issue after another and itâs just completely drained me at this point. Recently I had two close friends thatâs Iâve know since HS middle school who both have just entered motherhood (one had just given birth (unplanned) while the other just recently because pregnant (planned). I love them both to pieces even though I donât see them as much and Iâve tried to educate them on my mental health so they can understand but I donât think itâs fully registered on how it works. Now this issue thatâs in front of me is that the three of us are in our early 20s but Iâm not planning on having children no time soon nor do I have much experience with them but I love babies. However when they both told me about this very exciting news that I know meant a lot to them, Instantly triggered me. I felt scared and very sad which makes me look like a piece of shit I know because it sounds selfish. But itâs the truth. I was very scared of losing my two close friends because I know I feel like Iâll never see them as much and things will change because theyâll be busy with their babies also the idea of motherhood terrifies me right now. And I donât have many friends and this made me panic and sad even more. Initially when they both told me their news on separate occasions I didnât display the amount of excitement that I could because I felt numb. They both were aware prior to these events that my depression was getting bad to the point of isolation and lack of communication. I need help! My friends want me to be more supportive but how can I when I donât have the mentally energy anymore to extend myself, I try but itâs not enough and I still get shit on for it.

"We are generations of people who gave up. And there are many reasons why but I don't think that we are the reason. 

Jordan Peterson talked in one of his lectutes about a 2 year critical time  right around the age of 1 and 2 where we need human interaction the most. Thats where we learn the most social standarts. What I think is that since we stopped living in villigas and small communities we lack heavily in human interactions. There are places like kindergarden but they are too late. In germany there is a kita wich is for even younger children. The main thought for these is that the parents can go to work. That the wrong goal. These should be for social interaction teaching children how to get along. And how to deal with their own emotions by putting them in diffenet situations in fun games. 

Also children and teenager should be forced to get human interaction. I mean if you k ow how to meet new people and how to communicate with them because you are too anxious (as me) to do the first step then it will be extreamly difficult to get better in this on your own!

Also I think our world looks just dirty and filthy. That is no enviourment to be happy around and when you live in a place like me (germany) where it rains almost all day you are fucked if you are allready depressed. 

What I also think thaz we are missing is that we need proper educations in basic hygene and how important it is. I see too many small children running arou d with really bad breath. Or they just smell aweful in general. If they won't build a bsaic hygene routine now it will be extreamly difficult in the future. 

And finally we lack on proper thinking. As carlsagan said ""science is a way of thinking"" But we never get educated in this. They all expect us to know how to think scientificly. We should just have one  class where they give us problems sometimes basic and sometimes hard but they should never be such problem wich yoz can learn. Everyproblem need to be diffrent and should all be solvable by thinking scientificly. 

I think if all people had this basic skill sets allot of people would be less depressed and more motivated to do thinks because you would know how to solve problems wven if they were totally new and with unknow parameters for you.

Sorry for the long text but Idk where to post this else where then here since this is one way to prevent most of the depressions (like mine).

There have been occasions where both of us cancel sessions due to sickness, emergency or family issue. That's not a problem.

"33,m.  I went through a very hard and life changing break up last year.  Currently I live with a friend.  I make decent money, I have lots saved up, I have lots of hobbies and interests.  I've been told I'm a pretty good looking guy.  I've had a few women over the last year, but only one really stuck out.

I met this woman over a month ago and we kicked it off really quickly.  I developed feelings for her, but she just completely flaked out one day about 3 weeks ago (I'm presuming she met another guy).  

I have no idea why this is affecting me so much, but I feel really depressed about it.  I'm having troubles sleeping, I'm having crazy anxiety.  The other day I had my first anxiety attack, actually.  I'm starting to feel very hollow.  I feel like this isn't normal considering I only knew this woman for 2.5 weeks, but I just can't seem to shake this funk I'm in.

What is going on here?  Is this normal?  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get out of this funk?",4,she just completely flaked out one day about 3 weeks ago

Well life has hit me really hard again lately, so here I am.

Iâm just wondering if any of you can relate to never being excited as a kid? Or like things that were supposed to excite you made you anxious/embarrassed? 

For instance, I hated going on vacations with my family. I did not find them fun at all. I hated going to amusement parks and field trips because everyone around me would be having so much fun and I just couldnât. I rarely got excited on any holiday except a little bit on Christmas because it was the only time of year when everything around me seemed to calm down and people seemed to be genuinely nice to each other. I never thought my birthday was a big deal and never wanted parties, even though I had a good amount of friends. I just feel like this isnât normal for a kid and maybe I am actually clinically depressed, BUT I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A DIAGNOSIS. ",4,"ated going on vacations with my family.

I've never been depressed, never been in a relationship. After she broke up with me, I realized how pointless my life now is. I was working 10 hours days 6 days a week so I could support us. I was working for us, we were talking about getting married. It was a bit early but we were set on having kids. The thought of having a kid and family to take care of motivated me so much.

"Hello everyone, 

I've been struggeling with this issue for a long time now. 
As long as I can remember, my mom had an odd way of expressing her love and nurturing my growth. 

I remember when I was 13 she would make me scrub the floors on my bare knees because I didn't help around enough in the house. While doing that she would sing along to a song, calling me a coward and a weakling. 

She also saw me develop my eating disorder but never said anything untill it was too late. I've lost a lot of weight since then and come a long way but she never fails to rub it in my face. Even if I eat an apple as a snack, she would tell me to ""Watch the line"". 

These are just mere fragments of how she is towards me. Recently, I was talking to her about life partners. She flat out told me that, if anyone were to love me, they'd have to choose it very profoundly because I make everyone have a hard time.

Now, don't get me wrong, I did have a rebellious teen period. I just don't know why she can't get a new image of me? Does anyone have tips on how to survive this passive agressive fiesta my mother has? Maybe things I can do to show her how I've changed?

Would it be an idea for me to get some counseling? Pls help me...

"Hey all, sorry for the upcoming long-winded post but yeah, I'm feeling so down the past few months.

All started when my elder brother moved in, but before that, a brief background. I remember I used to have dreams of a particular job; well-adjusted, motivated. All of that ended when my eldest brother turned tail on me and accused me of selling secrets to a third-party, which I never did, but knowing that I might have wronged him, I apologized in a semi-self justifying way. That was my mistake, and of course he never accepted it. He was also backed by his wife and his wife's family over his decision to accuse me.

I looked up at him like a son would to his father, and his betrayal wrenched my heart so much it still hurts inside.

Moving forwards, not even my elder brother believed me, and kept telling me to admit my fault, in which case I never did anything. I also felt betrayed, but until the fateful day he was kicked out of living with my eldest brother, he didn't believe me and I rather liked living a pointless, solitary life with depressed me and my aunt. I didn't feel alive, but neither did I feel so utterly dead.

Now, when he moved, he's kinda bossy; the type to demand respect and not earn it. He forced me to find a job which created pressure and friction to my ego, because while I knew I was getting nowhere, I also needed the job, but he kept berating at me and my uselessness. It further spiraled my depression. This was the 'first' phase. Knowing full well nothing would go well with our permanent arrangement, I found a job at a colorless call center, which while greatly paying, stole all life I had on dreaming and hoping, and painted me an utter cynic. I only looked for the high of getting pay, feeding myself, and of course, pretending I was well while I was abused by customers. This of course continued until it was bearable to a point, but I was transferred between accounts. This shift in the playground furthered my lifelessness and having been moved to Comcast, because fuck Comcast, I handed my resignation and left the company. I found a job in sales, but the accumulated cynicism in the last 6-8 months killed whatever ability I had to close a sale. This was my fault, and no sooner than 2 months they kicked me out. I felt... free and semi-happy after that, ironically. It was shortlived, because I am fretting at the lack of funds I have (rather I built up some savings but I don't have income; that's distressingly worrying).

The call-center depression was over and I initially steeled myself to finding day-shift jobs. But, whatever happened, I wasn't able to find a job; due to circumstances, I can't *not* declare my 2 month stint because it would reflect on my taxes and I could get kicked for that. So I had to justify myself to companies who weren't really biting it. I don't want to go back to a call-center, but I guess I would still have easy entry over there.

This brings us to now. My elder brother is berating me for a lack of jobs, and when I ask him for advice, he basically tells me the obvious 'just get over it, be positive, yadda.' If I knew how to do that, I wouldn't want to stay being depressed. Then he throws me the bomb that I should shut up because my negativity was affecting him, and he wants to stay positive.

I feel massively betrayed and not too long ago I wanted to scream but it's the early mornings; I'd rather not. So I now feel incredibly useless, because I can't find a job I can tolerate, I feel non-functioning, all I do is worry other people and emit negativity, and I can't really help myself in any substantial way. Not even faith is helping me; it's even preventing me from dying because I'm too scared.

I feel so utterly useless and defeated, and I keep wondering why, if there's a protector watching above, why would they allow this? And I am so stretched apart I feel pained all over. Hell, basically all I do is mull over important decisions without deciding on one.

I feel so useless; and while I would want to visit a psychiatrist, I don't have the funds to maintain it.

I just wish I knew how to help myself. I'm still attached to the shadows of my past I can't move on to find better things.

I wish I didn't exist to trouble other people. So, apologies for having you listen to my rant; I have no idea what I was hoping to achieve here, looking back.",4,ldest brother turned tail on me and accused me of selling secrets to a third-party

So today, my best and only friend, he finally gave up on me. I've tried my very best to hide my depression from him, even going as far as constantly putting a mask on and suppressing my true emotions in an attempt to appease him and not become burdensome. But as many of you well know, that tends to become rather exhausting real quick... and sometimes our depressive nature shows. And today mine showed. He wanted to hangout and watch something, and I wasn't feeling up to it at all, so I politely let him know. He then went on to say in response ""You're always in such a gloomy mood... stop trying to make people feel bad for you cause it's not gonna happen."" He then told me that I need to grow up and that he doesn't want to talk to me for a while until I grow up... 

I'm not sure what to do now, like how I should go about this. I guess I just need some advice and/or guidance fellas. Anything will be immensely appreciated.

"It's like cancer. ""You've got 4 months to live."" But sometimes for some reason you outlive their prognosis. ""You've lived for 3 months more!"" It's like suicide. You choose a week.

"Hello. To start Iâll say that my depression has always been a peaks and troughs kind of mindset in which good and bad events flip the trigger. Since high school, however thereâs been a lingering perpetual sadness and loneliness.

Iâve never been the person that connects well with other people. Iâve had small groups of friends and a lot of times I have trouble finding a deeper feeling of a strong relationship with those people, like they are surface level. 

Then there was a girl...
I met her freshman year of college and quickly we were together and happy. Whenever I think of times where my sadness and anxiety was completely irrelevant to me, it was times with her. Our third year of college, though she went abroad and broke it off. She tells me how she felt codependent with me and needed her independence, but loves me. This was the first of multiple times this has happened, and I fell into a very dark place. 

She came back, though for senior year, and we quickly got back together, the way things were.

When we graduated she wanted to move to a new city she fell in love with when interning for a summer. I had opportunity in the city we were in, and so we went separate ways. We stayed in touch for a few months until, for the second time, I got a call with the same speech I got when she went abroad. I thought that was it and I would move on. Sad, but I needed to try. I dragged through my life bitter at the place I was living and the thin to non-existent relationships I had with people. I even dated someone a few months later, but I was never happy with her, yet I stuck with it and got broken up with again. There I was, hurt by someone I didnât care too much about but at the fact I was alone and canât find a relationship quite like before. 

Now to a few months ago. A friend of both me and my college ex catches up with her unexpectedly when she was in town for a few days. She tells them she thinks about me sometimes and what could have been...and that sheâd be happy if I got in touch. I pounced on this opportunity. I didnât go into this expecting anything to come of it other than companionship, but as before, it fell back into how we always were together.

A month ago she calls me upset. Thereâs another guy where she is living and is torn between me and him. She tells me to âclaim what is mineâ and if I moved closer to her she could promise me we could try again. I tell her how I feel and what comes out of it is a trip to see her for New Years. I go to see her and I have never felt less depressed in my life. Being with her made me want to actively try to live happier, healthier, and work harder. 

Itâs hard to leave to come home though and both of us are anxious about what will happen. The day came when we had to talk about it and basically I felt like I needed to make a big play. It was either going to work, or I would go down knowing Iâd try. I told her how I felt when I was with her and that I was willing to move there and work everything out. I told her I loved her and itâs what I want to take a chance for......all I received, was for the third time, was indecisiveness and doubt. She said she didnât know if sheâs willing up everything she built from scratch in her new City and doesnât want to fall in her old feeling of codependency. I felt defeated and lost.

I know this was a long post, and I appreciate anyone who made it this far. The conclusion is I have never felt more alone and isolated in both the lack of relationships I have and the place I live. Iâm at a point where I donât know where I belong or the purpose I serve, and the girl I loved I wasnât good enough for, which feels like it transcends to everyone I put an effort into. Iâm not sure if Iâm looking guidance or just anyone to listen, but all in all, thanks for reading.

"More than ever, my motivation is just gone. I've been 'unhappy' for roughly 3 years (I've refrained from calling myself depressed since I haven't actually been professionally diagnosed with anything since I'm too afraid to get help). I don't feel like waking up anymore. I wake up briefly, then sleep until 3 in the afternoon. I haven't been going to sleep until 4:00 AM at the earliest, because I lie there and dwell on the dumb things that I've done in the past, think about the the things I'm afraid of for my future, struggle with my crippling loneliness-- I just can't fall asleep instantly.
I don't feel like eating. I have no appetite. I'm losing weight when I'm already too thin. Because of my social anxiety, I've isolated myself from everyone I used to know-- and now I have nobody. I'm too emotionally attached to a group of people that will never even know that I exist, so much so that the thought of them being gone someday completely breaks me. My feelings have only gotten worse, especially over the last two months. I've cried so many times over the past few days. I haven't taken care of myself at all.
I don't think I'd ever bring myself to take my own life, but the thought of randomly being put out of my misery seems so refreshing.
But I'm too afraid to speak up about it to anybody. I don't want to worry anyone. And the times that I have tried to subtly cry for help, I've only been responded to with ""Go home, lie down, drink some tea, and read a book-- you might feel better!"" but it doesn't work like that.

Im 17. I'm posting this on am account I've just created because if I get through this, I won't want other people to know I've written the post.

I've spent this evening preparing the place where I would hang myself. It's a storage room, at the top of our building. I've made a mess in order to leave space around the hanger in which I used to hang my bike because it's the only place where I think I can accomplish my purpose of ending my life. I've cried whole oceans of tears while doing, however, I was willing to do it. I swear I was, I was extremely afraid of what I would feel while hanging, but then I thought again about my life and came to the conclusion that it was worth it. However, I went down to my house in order to go to the toilet, eat, etc. (maybe those were just excuses set by the survival instinct?), saw my mother and cried again. I ended up having dinner with my family, doing some house chores and I can't hold my tears anymore (Actually, I've had to go out a few times so they didn't notice). I might be alive tomorrow night or might not; if I am (because I'm unable to hang myself), they will discover my hanging set-up because we will be putting away the Christmas stuff in the storage room. 

(sorry, now I can't think clearly, I can't share with you everything I'd like to, so I'll jump to the end right now)

What would happen if I told my mother? I know it might be the help I need to continue living but life we'll never be the same. I hope she doesn't freak out in the moment, but even if she wasn't, I don't want her to be worrying about whether I would try to commit suicide again, searching on the internet  ""how to help my teenager suicidal son"", if I would try to hurt myself with a new knife that she has bought or , if I would jump off a high building when I get the chance. Also, there might be some times in my life in which a psychological test is needed to access a new job or opportunity. What if due to my mother they find out that I've been/am suicidal? What if they tell my grandparents or someone in the family and they spread the word unintentionally?

I've never told anyone about my feelings, both ending my life and seeking help iin my parents induce me too much fear.

"First of all, I firmly apologize if this is long.
I just got dumped and had my heart broken. AGAIN!
My life is so fucking bad, I really want it all to end. I never had ANY success in my love life. Any relationship that I would enter, I would just get heartbroken. I've been terribly depressed before due to my other break-ups, but more than one year ago, I met this beautiful girl (let's call her Sara) who changed my life. At the time, she was the only good thing to come in my life. She was always there for me, she'd comfort me when I'm not okay, she'd make me laugh, she was just THERE and that's all I needed. She told me she loves me so many times and always used to say that she'll be here always and forever. And I trusted her. We've been together for over a year and I really got attached to her. I love her so fucking much. Throughout December, I was looking back at the past few months and couldn't believe how good my life has become, just because of that one person. 
Tonight, she just told me that she has changed. That she has made new decisions for 2018, that she completely changed. She explained how her love for me is simply leaving, and that's it. I haven't done anything, I've always been there for her, I did my best as a boyfriend. She didn't let me say anything, to try and change her mind. It ended so fast.
My whole life got destroyed tonight. She was my whole life. And I know I'm not getting her back. I love her so much and I don't know what to say. I've spent 2 hours just crying, thinking and listening to some music. I feel so empty, my heart just fucking hurts. I'm just thinking of ending it all. On top of that, I have other problems - my mother is sick and I have financial problems. She made it better. She gave me hope. I'm tired of it all. The pain, the tears and despair. I don't even understand anymore; HOW CAN IT GET BETTER? I don't see any possible scenario of my life getting better. I really wanted to share, and I have no one so close to me to really vent out. I only have Reddit.
Thank you so much if you read through this, it means so much. I'm broken right now. I don't know what's gonna happen to me or what I'll do.",4,"she completely changed. She explained how her love for me is simply leaving, and that's it"
"Hi there, I'm looking for a best friend, as the post says so. Looking for someone who understands the life of a depressed, and doesn't give stupid advice like ""it's all in your head, you just have to think positive"". Someone who doesn't give up on you no matter what. I'm specifically looking for a best friend instead of friend because most of the time, people don't take online friendships seriously. But I do. My friends are real humans with feelings. I'm ready to invest effort, time and emotions into a friendship that is worth it, even if it's just online :)

A little bit about me, I'm a 23 year old female. INFP, for any myer-briggs fans out there. I'm probably the most emotional person you'll ever see. My heart totally rules my head. But I do have morals which keeps me sane of course. I get attached pretty easily, and I'm pretty clingy. Maybe a bit too much for normal people to handle... But so far I've met some who can handle it :D My interests include writing poems, collecting cute stuff, singing, and thinking about life and possibilities.

"All I want is to die. I want to end this endless pain. Every moment is torture. Every day I come here with no response from her. Not even a look.
Every day she ignores me and for good reason. Because Iâm ugly. Because Iâm stupid. Because nobody has ever liked me and nobody ever will. Because there are thousands of guys sheâd rather be with than me. Because Iâm nothing to her. Because I literally disgust her or Iâm not even a flinching thought in her mind. Because Iâm not worth the thought. Iâm not worth anything. I should have killed myself a long time ago. I should go home and take pills, binge wine, and let myself fall into a sleep that I canât wake up from. Then the world can be rid of me. Which is all they ever really wanted.
Iâm a virgin. A 32 year old virgin. I feel ashamed. I feel like I donât belong anywhere and that no one wants me. I feel broken. I feel like I should have never been born or I should have died.
Iâve only had one âgirlfriendâ that lasted about a week. Then as soon as I mentioned I had anxiety and that I was a virgin, she dumped me. She realized how broken I was and ran for the hills. She did the right thing. I am broken. I donât deserve her. I donât deserve anyone. I just deserve to die. This whole life is a mistake. This whole life is a waste. Iâm sorry to everyone who knows me for my existence. Iâm sorry Iâm here. I donât want to be. I promise I wonât be very long.
I want to end it. I canât stand another day of this life. I canât take any more of this torture and suffering. Nobody cares. They donât. You donât care. They donât care. I donât care. Iâm done. Iâm done living in a world that doesnât care. A world that watches suffering unflinchingly and simply smiles and goes about their days not wanting to be bothered with things that are unpleasant.
Iâm tired of waiting for nothing. I feel like Iâm walking an endless road to nowhere. I just keep getting further and further away from what I once considered normalcy with every step I take.
God Iâve been fucked over so many times in my life. It feels like, if there is a God, He or She is hellbent on repeatedly torturing me by lifting me up with glimmers of hope before smashing me back down with crushing disappointment. This is the story of my life.
I want to die. I deserve everything bad because Iâm worthless. I just want it all to end now. Please let me die. Let an earthquake hit and the ground swallows me up.

"Why is it that we often hold on to something that we shouldnât. We were two women early 20âs dated for 5 years. Our relationship faced many ups and downs as any relationship does. There were times that were easily defined as toxic. Then why do I still deeply miss her, she still remains as the first and last thought of every day. We donât speak, we donât associate through social media, all contact has been cut.

Little back story, like I said we were in a lesbian relationship together. She so badly wanted to get married and although I was unsure I knew essentially she was the person I would love to spend the rest of my life with. As we went through the process of getting a ring everything fell into place it had been 2 years without almost any fights. Finally the big day came, I proposed.
She said yes! Only to break up with me for âno reasonâ a week later. I was destroyed. She moved out nearly 3 months later and took her almost 5 months to admit she was sleeping with her male boss a week before I proposed.

I forgive her for these things that she mustâve been too ashamed to admit. She made me believe I was crazy when I noticed late night texts from her boss. Literally convinced me I had imagined seeing his name pop up on her phone, I suppose to cover up the fact she was doing something not very nice to the person she was supposed to marry. All and all thinking I was literally going crazy drove me to deep contemplation of suicide several times.

Thereâs more details involved that are to say the least twisted and sick but I was so desperately trying to hold on to her that I didnât think twice of her late nights 6 days of the week or helping her shave private places when she said she was hanging with friends..

When she left she told me it was easy for her to leave me just as she left her family for me. She came from a loving family unfortunately they were Jehovahs Witnesses so they disassociated with her immediately after finding out she had been dating a âworldlyâ female. 

I know sheâs damaged psychologically, and in my heart I just want to pick her up and help her through her problems. She wonât let me, and thatâs okay. But why do I miss her so? Why is she in my daily thoughts and nightly dreams? Itâs been a year and time will keep rolling, will I always miss this woman that wasnât healthy for me or herself?

Thanks if you actually read this and to all itâs okay if you didnât, simply feel a tad better getting these deep thoughts off of my chest.

We got coffee, talked and laughed about stuff and we made plans to hang out today. Yesterday night I was really upset so I asked him to come over. We got food and went back to my apartment. We talked for a while and I got really sad and started crying. He hugged me and told me that I'll be okay. I just really wanted physical attention and love at that point so I kissed him and straddled him and we made out for a while.



Today he came over and we just hung out and played cards and stuff. He said we should go for a drive which we did and then he wanted to show me his apartment. We went inside and he showed me around. We went into his room and he took his jacket off and we started kissing a lot. I laid in his bed and he got on top of me and we made out some more.

A few months ago I had a really bad anxiety attack and said a lot of awful things to a friend who had been incredibly amazing and supportive. She no longer talks to me. After continued (useless) therapy and meds, sobering up, and staying away from the knife, I was unable to prove to her that I had gotten any better. And I haven't. I cut off all my friends without saying a word because I knew that I would rely on them and that there was a good chance of another bad attack, and because I felt unwanted, excluded, and hated.

I know Im supposed to move on from my ex after Im dumped, especially if Im still in love with her, but I dont have any close friends and my ex was my best friend when we dated too. I tried to go on without her for a while when she ghosted me, but I was in the darkest place I had ever been in, I literally was so close to attempting, since then I've reached back out to her and I've reached a state where unlike before, I can live life, but I have a very strong urge I will never be happy because she will never be with me again. 

So we've been talking again for a day or two, a month ago, if she was active she would literally be texting me, she would tell me anything and everything, and that brought so much joy to my life. But now she'll talk to me about some random shit every few hours, seening my all the time like she doesnt really wanna let me in. But honestly, its better this way for my mental health than not talking to her at all. She often expresses how ""I still mean a lot to her"".

I know through some sources that shes started to click with some other guy like we used when we first started dating and Im honestly so close to a fucking mental break down. Just the idea of her moving on already is like a fucking dagger through the heart, but if I stop talking to this girl I lose myself entirely right now. I dont know what to do, one of my friends died last night and that has put me in an even worse place than before. I would usually talk to my ex about it but shes pointed out (and its true) that I had a phase where I would go to her and seek attention and support and shes tired of it. I know shes right because it was an extremely narcissistic phase and It was definitely my bad. Anyway, I dont really know what to do, I havent cried in a few days but I think I will today.",4,"was dating a really great girl but she dumped me, were really close friends after we broke up, even made out once after, but after that she kind of ghosted me on everything, she didnt want to get back together, Its been a while since then and I kinda lashed out at her, which pushed me out of her close friend circle"

"I know for me I came to realize by my late teenage years that I have developed dual brain consciousness. What I mean is I alternate between two states at any given moment. Around friends and family I ""turn on"" my visual hemispheres. I actively look to be creative and funny and this drains my energy. When I'm alone I turn off and operate entirely on unconscious awareness. I will stare at the wall and ""recharge"" No thoughts, no feelings, like a dead man. People who caught me in the ""off mode"" have told me I  have dead eyes. 
   
All of this translates to my sex life (non existent right now) But when it was active I was never able to cum inside a woman. The reason being sex is a spontaneous act. And i operate like a robot in the off or on mode. I simply can't let go like other people. 

This is what causes my depression. Could be autism, adhd, or any other host of illnesses. Bottom line is after 25 years I realize you can't change it hard as you try.

"Hi Reddit. I don't know where to turn so I'm posting here.

Ever since my break up a month ago, it's been very hard to feel happiness.

We were together for more than two years and it was one of those relationships where we were very close. We depended on each other very much and were each other's best friends. I have a very hard time meeting people and making friends but I was totally happy to just spend time with her all the time. Literally my ""me time"" that I relished in before the relationship became ""us time"" and it felt good and right for me. We told each other we were in love before the relationship officially started and while I think the feelings of love morphed and changed and were periodically lost over the course of the relationship, she was always my best friend in the world. I trusted her completely and her company was all I needed.

We traveled all around together. Last summer we worked seasonal jobs in Alaska and then headed to the Grand Canyon after that to work through the winter. We had all these plans that I was so excited for and I was so happy to be able to have that experience with someone I was so close to. Nothing seemed off about the relationship and I trusted her so much I didn't think to question a new ""friendship"" with a guy she worked with.

Fast forward to a month ago and she wakes up one morning and tells me she hasn't been very happy being with me for a few months now and that she's developed feelings for this dude. I was totally shocked and blindsided. My entire world was turned upside down. Everything I enjoyed about life was suddenly gone and I was completely alone. She moved on without so much as a second guess like it was nothing. I found myself in a very shitty situation and I ran back home to my parent's house.

My self esteem is completely gone. I feel worthless, replaceable, unimportant, unattractive, and used. All the plans we made together are now hers and she's carrying them out with her new fuck buddy, like I was never even there. Everything I wanted for this winter is completely gone. I feel as if my life was stolen from me. These plans meant so much to me and they were suddenly hijacked. I feel like I'm stuck back where I started. My life has changed so much since I met her and I have no idea how to continue that without that type of relationship with someone. I want to get back out there and get a new job somewhere and travel again but I'm terrified to do it alone. Happiness is only real when shared after all.

The result is I've been severely depressed. I barely eat. I only get up to smoke cigarettes. Nothing at all that I used to enjoy gives me any pleasure. Conversations with old friends and family do not stimulate me at all. I cannot feel a single modicum of happiness. I feel either depressed, angry, insecure, or anxious at all times. I literally have not felt a single positive emotion since we broke up. It's been a month now. There are no ""good days"" along with the bad ones, there are only and always bad days. I strongly fantasize about suicide on a daily basis. I don't want to, and I doubt I will, but the thought of all my problems disappearing and not existing anymore is one of the few gratifications I can derive in this state of mind.

All I do is obsess over her and what she's doing and think about our old times and what should have been and go over every reason I hate her in my head over and over and over and over again. Today I sent her a million nasty texts to try to get under her skin and make her fight me. She just told me to go fuck myself and to stop texting her and that was that. I hyperventilated and got in the shower and punched the wall over and over and cried and screamed.

I feel I am unwell and I do not know what to do.

Sorry for the long post.",4,"since my break up a month ago, it's been very hard to feel happiness"
"Hello. First of all, i apologize about my English. I'm 17yo and I do not usually speak english. I'll do my best for sure.
I'll present myself shortly : 
I'm a 17yo white boy in Western Europe, 1m85 tall. Diagnosed HIQ ( 144, with a IQ verbal/IQ perf rate = ~1,3 ) at the age of 10 and dealing with ego problems, i've been depressed the two last years because of hyper-empathy ( a fucked up word to explain that my exgirlfriend's rape's story traumatized me. ) and social awkwardness. ( I've got few friends that i've known since elementary school which i love, but furthermore, i have never been a sociable person. )
So, after those two years of moderate to severe depression, I've been going better the last three months, since i've definitely broke up with my toxic ex-girlfriend, but i'm recently going worse since i met this other girl. We met each other two and a half month ago. This night, I was crying so badly because of my ex when she came to me and gave me a hug. She took care of myself, she heard me, she told me her own story, and then we slept together. Since this night, we have been dating each other. 
She has been so nice with me all this time long.
Two months later, i'm feeling as if i'm not deserving her. By induction, i'm feeling as if i wouldn't ever been able to be happy with anyone due to my low self esteem. ( That was already a problem during my last love-relationship. )
I've already use to struggle with depression, but what panics me is that i'm in graduating class and I have to succed it if i wan't to have a nice CPGE ( preparatory classes to prestigious universities ) and thus i would more likely get a well ranked university. 
I'm feeling lost. I don't have any idea about what i should do, if I should leave her asap to flee my own problems, if finally works shouldn't have the priority for once and i should focus about myself, or if i'm not seeing the most important here...
Thanks to you if you read me, that was pretty difficult for me to write ""non-academicly"" in English. If i did loud ( or even slight, but it should contains a lot and i wouldn't take up too much of your time ) mistakes, i would be glad to learn and improve my English, by the way. Have a nice day or a nice evening. It's 4a.m. for me while i'm writing this. ",4,my exgirlfriend's rape's story traumatized me

I'm willing to be patient because I love her so much. But that doesn't mean waiting is easy, especially since I don't have any certainty. I still miss her and think about her everyday. It hurts.

"I feel like most of us are leaning way more toward the emotional than the stoic. And as a male I have been trained to not be emotional, and also there really isn't a support system in place. Friends are great but it's more shooting the shit and screwing around than having sessions where i can just open up and cry. Even female friends of mine in the past seemed weirded out when i just needed to vent and share and break down a little. I have built boundaries that keep my self propped up on a bed of twigs to where i am solitary in what ever i am feeling. And when the weight is there those twigs snap and i have nowhere to turn. It's created i very unhealthy situation where it's all or nothing. If i open up i gush, and if i don't then you will never see that side of me. I'm sick of ""maning up"", sick of having to accommodate some bullshit notion that i can't feel. I was always a sensitive kid and i am a sensitive adult but perpetually hiding behind a mask of indifference which creates a cognitive dissonance on the basic story of who the hell i even am. When im ""stable"" im just living a lie i've been trained to live. And when im broken all the feelings i've suppressed come out and bite me right in the ass and boom i can't function anymore. 

How can you create balance?  I feel like most people are able to ride both conforming with the world and expressing themselves in some kind of way that doesn't have to be at total odds with each other. Where when something triggers them, they don't fall into a state where they can't even take care of themselves. Obviously there is a lot to do with the fact they have a more balanced brain chemistry, and their threshold for pain is far higher but i still think there is something to this lack of balance that contributes heavily to depression in general. 

Also, sidenote, as a man how in the hell can i find someone to open up to? I just need to talk sometimes and need a hug and don't want the entire emotional burden to be placed on a SO (which i scare away due to said mistake). I love the few friends i have but they in no way can offer that kind of support. ",4,just need to talk sometimes and need a hug and don't want the entire emotional burden

"3 years ago I moved in with a drunk. A man who drank at least a whole bottle of vodka a day. He would do the most random crazy shit he would punch a flat screen tv countless times for no reason, beat his girlfriend and bruise her, head butt her mom and scream and yell. One time he forced us to leave with his girlfriend at 12pm in the rain and we had to walk down the road until the cops came and  asked if we were okay. Things like this happened all the time. My bedroom was right under there's and I was forced to listen to them scream at each other and his girlfriend crying and screaming ,things getting thrown, her being thrown around and then having sex. I lived with them for 3 years and the final year I noticed a difference in myself. My room was kept constantly dark I would sleep all night get up and go to school and then come home and go right back to sleep when I was up all I could do is read for hours or watch tv blankly. I started to be rude to my mom and my family members. Whenever they would come in my room I would yell at them to get out (I'm pretty sure they just think I'm a cunt) before all this happend I got into a relationship with someone I didn't want to be with because I was being reckless. the last year I broke up with her (I don't even like woman either but I still dated her) I started to eat way to much and I started to stop talking. I missed a lot of school to the point where my mom was almost brought to court. I don't know if this matters but my style started to change and the music I listened to. I had no energy or motivation. At the time I didn't know I was depressed I just knew I was unhappy. 

Right now I have to share a room with my brother since we are staying with someone until we find our own place. The darkness comes out when I'm alone, and rn I'm constantly around someone which threw me into this state of numbness. It gave almost the complete opposite affect I can't eat I can't sleep I don't want to do anything and I'm still unhappy. I miss sleep.

"Hey guys! Iâm new here, and I have been hesitant to speak on this. My depression started around 3 years ago during my sophomore year in high school, and Iâve tried to suppress it as much as possible, but unfortunately it still plagues me in small instances while being in my second semester of college. One of them that I canât seem to shake, is not being interested in literally anything. I used to love video games, now I canât play one for 5 minutes without getting bored or annoyed. I used to love skateboarding, and now I canât stand to go out and do it. Can anyone give me tips or solutions?

"Three years ago my dad died, it hardly feels like three weeks. It's like everything else in my life is so insignificant in comparison, it's like a black hole that distorts my perception of time. It's as if time passes 100x faster since it and everything before it is so long ago.

People say that after a major event in their life everything feels categorised into before and after it but to me it feels like things that are it and not, but most of them are.

People have been telling me since then that I probably have depression and should maybe get help but that's mostly just from seeing me because I don't open up.

"Hello all. This is my first post in this sub, and this actually is probably my first serious post on all of Reddit. Iâm just here because I would like to get some things off my chest and Iâm not in a situation where I can express my feelings to people around me in my life such as my mom and dad or friends. Itâs best to say these things to people I donât know but may also suffer from the same feelings or ideas.

I am severely and unhealthily depressed. I stress myself out over little things, I constantly put myself down, blame myself for things that I damn well know are not actually my fault, treat myself horribly and find different ways to make my life even worse daily. I donât like being this way, but I have tried so many different methods to change these kinds of behaviors and feelings but nothing I have done makes me change. Iâve tried antidepressants, ânatural alternativesâ to medicine, exercising my stress away, surrounding myself with positive thoughts and energy and people, but for some reason, every night when I return home and get in the bed, I lie awake thinking of how worthless and pointless my existence is. I am absolutely SHOWERED by thoughts of depression and worthlessness, despite knowing how many good friends and family I have, despite knowing how good my life has the potential to be. Every day feels almost like a struggle to me because I spend a good portion of the day out and about with friends or at work, or whatever Iâm doing, but as soon as I get by myself somewhere, I almost immediately start to get those depressive thoughts again and again.

It almost seems like my brain refuses to let the rest of me be happy. I try to push away the bad thoughts and sadness but it just keeps coming back even stronger every time and I have gotten to the point where I donât know how to handle myself anymore. I have suicidal thoughts daily, although I would never act upon them because I know that suicide is not the only answer to my issues. But itâs just an every day thought that I have, that I struggle with constantly. Always telling myself, âYouâre a failure anyway, why not just do itâ or things like âYou know your family or anybody wouldnât ACTUALLY miss you, right?â Itâs just little things like those that add up ever so much throughout the days, weeks, and months that I struggle with. Sometimes I will have days that are absolutely fantastic like going to a concert or being in a show or whatever, and then as soon as I get home, I feel like garbage for whatever reason. No matter how many positive thoughts I try to think, the bad thoughts always find a way to become stronger and break through my positivity. And Iâm just not sure what to do about it anymore.

Apologies for writing so much, but as I said before, these were things that I was keeping bottled up because I could not tell my family or friends about this because of reasons Iâm not actually sure of. Fear that I will be judged, maybe fear of losing friendships, I donât know. Regardless, I thank you for reading this long ass post and hope that maybe someone has any stories or advice or whatever they would like to share.",4,would like to get some things off my chest and Iâm not in a situation where I can express my feelings to people around me in my life such as my mom and dad or friends
"I watched The Greatest Showman the other day, and the song âA Million Dreamsâ made me cry so hard. It basically details the love story between the main character and his future wife. They talk about the big dreams they have, and the fact that they picture a world where these dreams come true helps them get through today.

I just kept wishing that I had someone who loved me the way they loved each other. That I could have dreams that could actually become a reality someday. That I could be someone special instead of another sad lonely person waiting for a miracle that will never happen.

"In the past two weeks, I haven't spoken to a soul. When I was a kid, people always said that I was chatty. It took me a long time to realize that I spoke all my thoughts trying to get the inability to have a conversation out of my system. It's years later and sometimes I think it's better to be alone. It takes so much for me to hold my self together. So much to not end my life. I hope someday I'll be glued back, or someone will help me carry the pieces.

I've also thought of talking to a therapist about it, but that will never happen. I can't see myself ever opening up about any of this in person.

This is where my brain goes to sleep,and I reflect of my thoughts,and think further,as I am a dumbass.

me:Well,what if I die?

me to me:you will either be rencarniated,or experience infinate blackness,wait,you are dead!oh yeah,since you do not have a sence of perspective anymore,time will theretically go infinatily fast and the universe will just die of heat death,and even if you rencarniate,there is a 99.9969% that you will become something of no value,like a gnat,or a housefly,and even if you become human again,you will have another chance to experience the misery of feeling dead,depression,and 20+ years of education,and also die on the inside seeing our society collapse right before your eyes,and also,the memories of your awesome parents will also be gone,or you will spawn in a test tube,and you will be a subject for science experiments.

Starting from october 2016, I've started writing a public diary in Tumblr, hoping that this can actually help relieve this opressive feeling. Has any of you tried doing something like this and if so, is it helping you?",4, me and my family suffering from a severe depresion 
"My daughter tried to kill herself, again. This is the third attempt that I know of. Her husband walked into the bathroom as she was digging into her arm. He said he has never seen anything like it. He is traumatized. After discovering that she had been self medicating with drugs and then this he is done. He is scared that her poor choices will land him in military prison. I love my daughter and this young man and I am saddened for both of them. I am sad for my daughter, I am not sure she will survive this break up. I am truly afraid that I will be burying my daughter.

My daughter has a mental illness. She has been diagnosed as bipolar and clinically depressed. This has been a struggle since she was a young teenager. We have lost friendships and family ties because of her poor choices, the lies, and lack of impulse control. She has stolen medication from me and others. She revealed, in a most spectacular fashion, that she was a drug addict when she was a teenager, all in front of a class that we were taking together. Needless to say I gave myself permission to have distance from my daughter. She was an adult. I had gotten her help, I had fought with her about staying on medications and going to doctors appointments. As an adult I could no longer force her to do what needed to be done, it was now up to her. 

She seemed to figure it out. She had a job, a bf, a home, and friends. I could see that she struggled with the rollercoaster that came with her diagnosis, but she was making it. Couple years in things toppled. Suddenly her friends and bf were done with, she had burned bridges with them. She was floating with no anchor or refuge. Except me and my partner. We were moving and offered her the opportunity to start fresh in another state. She leaped at the opportunity. But she first wanted to visit with my sister in yet another state. The agreement was that she would join us in the new place after spending time with my sister.

This turned into her living there until she burned bridges there. She became homeless. Too prideful to tell me that she was reduced to living in a homeless camp. All because she was now taking drugs to self medicate and she knew this would horrify me. She kept a job. She met the young man who would help get her clean, and marry her. He joined the military, they got stationed state side. Her husband and I continually prompted her to get medication and help. She put it off. She was on a high with life. Then the cycle began again.

She started using meth about 6 months ago. She snorted cocaine. She smoked weed. She planted this stuff in another persons car so that they couldn't turn her in. She was making illogical choices based on the drugs and her ill mind. My SIL left her to figure out what to do. Her actions could land him in Leavenworth, ruin his career. 

He came home and found what she had done. He got help for her. She calls me to tell me in her most piteous voice. Tries to tell me that he wouldn't listen to her, that she was getting rid of his monster of a wife. No amount of explaining and questioning would get her to see that these were her choices. As I write this, she is hospitalized. She knows that he wants a divorce, but she wants to fight for him. No convincing her that this is what needs to happen right now. He doesn't trust her, he is angry, and tired. I don't think he wants to continue and I can not blame him.

So where does this leave my broken daughter? I don't know. I am in another state. I am not where she wants to be. I fear that once she is released and she sees that he is done and he removes her from base it will be the beginning of the end. I have told her she needs to figure out what she wants. I feel she will choose drugs and all that comes with it. While I want so much more for her, I can't make her choose the path of health and sanity. I am heartbroken.",4," daughter has mental illness, tried to kill herself, diagnosed with bipolar disoreder , lost family ties and friendship"
"I have no reason to feel this way. I am surrounded by loving family and caring friends but is there a reason for me just listening to slow music that appeals to me personally most nights and just feeling sad?

 I haven't really felt 100% for a couple years now, but no one i know has an inkling of what's happening to me, cause i think i hide it quite well with humour and when im socialising, it grants me temporary relief from these feelings of self doubt and loneliness, but always, when im alone these feelings creep back in and i can never seem to be rid of them. 

I've never really had much luck with relationships, i had something serious a couple months back, which actually stopped my lamenting, but it fizzled out pretty quickly and the feelings returned, and magnified with each failure to communicate with any girl im interested in.

And now i sit here by myself, again, watching the fireworks from my window as my family sleeps and with music in my ears, just feeling.. sad.

I don't really know how to explain it or why I'm like this, so i figured i may as well share and get outside opinions on it. Im not searching for a solution, just a means to understand this

"I'm 18(M) and turning 19 in a month time. I've been having depression since late Jan 2016 which started because of an extremely bad break up, financial issues, parents divorcing thus having to move out as well as performing badly in class.


i'll try to keep the post short and simple because I'm exhausted right now, typing this on mobile doesn't help too, especially for formatting.


Any advice from those who have/had depression would be greatly appreciated. Well, just ranting for online does relief everything in which I had bottled up.


So on new year, I just broke up with my girlfriend(4months) and connections from my close friends. My relationship was toxic as it felt as though I was the only one trying as I clinged onto the thoughts that she would be the one who help me to get out of depression. She was initially really supportive and that was why I was attracted to her, she helped me to elavate my abuse of tobacco but I feel as though I'll fall back into that sinkhole.


People change and I don't blame her. She feels exhausted and does not feel the same way anymore.


Right now I'm just really exhausted of everything.
I have scheduled appointments for a psychiatrist that was done by the SAF, Singapore's Army basically.


I don't know what to expect besides perhaps being announced as clinically depressed. Does a psychiatrist really help? Any response would be greatly appreciated.

"*I apologize in advance for the throwaway and being vague, I feel like this post would do more harm than help if anyone involved were to find it*

**A little backstory:**
My (22m) ex (19f) has a history of depression, much of it deep seeded from experiences in her childhood and a lack of support from her family. For the better half of our relationship (~1.5 year)  it seemed to be fairly under control and she seemed pretty happy. She had meds and was seeing a therapist. I've also struggled with depression for about 3 years now, starting before our relationship. I broke up with her for fairly shallow reasons; I was freaked out about being ""tied down"" having to always consider someone else's emotions and feelings when I can barely take care of my own, and I have huge self-esteem issues. It was obviously very rough but we still care about each other and try to maintain a friendship still.

**What is very concerning to me:** she recently got a new boyfriend and everyone appears to be ok that we still talk as friends to support each other, mainly because we know each other well so it's easy for us to talk openly about personal issues. Very recently however, she messaged me around 1:30 AM and said she needed help, which I've learned is code for she's drunk at a friends and can't stay the night there. Ask her if she called her boyfriend and she says they haven't been talking. Says she can't go home because her parents will flip their shit (which is true). I offer to give her a ride and let her stay at my place and she agrees. 

I knew she had been drinking occasionally with friends but this was completely different. She was almost incoherent and told me during the ride that this was the 5th night in a row that she had drank. While we were dating we rarely drank and if we did it was together, so this was completely irregular behavior. I remember she trailed off one of her sentences by repeating ""I don't know"" over and over while crying. We get to my house (I still live at home) and she's stumbling around and wakes my mom up who I apologize to profusely. We go to my room and she starts crying again and saying some very dark stuff, basically about not wanting to live anymore. I'm very shaken at this point, no longer annoyed and I start crying with her while we just lay on my bed. I had no idea what to say or do so I just kind of held her from behind while she calmed down so she couldn't hit herself or make a lot of noise and wake my parents. When she sobered up a little bit she apologized and said that she ""just didn't care about anything anymore and wanted to disappear"". We fell asleep around 6 AM.

**If you read nothing else, please read this:** We wake up in the afternoon and I take her to her car. Both of us are pretty silent, she was hungover, upset and embarrassed so I try not to say anything insensitive. We part ways and I just go for a long ass drive to clear my head. I have no fucking idea how to deal with this, I can't even take care of myself. I get drunk alone a lot and just don't tell anyone. I lay in bed all fucking day wanting to cry. I don't leave my house unless I have to. But I still care about her and need to help her because who the fuck else will? Her boyfriend is apparently useless, her ""friends"" are terrible fucking influences who don't care about anything besides getting fucked up to hide from their problems and her parents the moodiest people I've ever met. This whole situation has completely thrown me into a hole again because I have no idea what to do for her or myself. I'm not a dad, a therapist or a psychiatrist. I NEED advice to help her before she hurts herself or becomes dependent.

**TL;DR** please read the last paragraph if nothing else, my ex (who I'm still close to) and I both have depression. She has been turning to alcohol to escape her feelings and I am not a dad or therapist and have no idea how to help her before she hurts herself or gets worse *without* seeming like a hypocrite because I do the same damn shit.",4,"My ex, still care about her ,still  care about her,thrown me into the hole again"
"It seems like my 15-mid 20's I've had depression, I'm 25.

And these last few months hit me hard: I love to learn, I love learning about the world, the universe, programming in C++, etc. But reading philosophy made matters worse, I couldn't even get into discussions like free will or determinism, or simple politics; even worse if nihilism, existentialism, the existence of God, the soul, quantum mechanics, etc. were involved.

I noticed I had problem. I kinda just realized that nobody knows what's going on. Those questions, the big whys and hows are somehow preventing me from carrying on with my life. I was upset because it feels like there were no answers to those things. I still can't think straight, I get very emotional sometimes, crying in secret (I know, I should tell others). I think it has to do with my childhood: My mother is a hoarder, my father is an alcoholic who sometimes beat her, and they sometimes threatened to harm each other with knives and guns, my father went on long trips away, sometimes the police were involved. My mother would beat me and my brother, with belts or brooms (or la fabulosa chancla), sometimes for doing bad things... that's how they (and us, by proxy) were raised. But my sister and younger brother, haven't been hit once after I was 15. I know they wanted better for me and my siblings, deep down. And I don't want my siblings to feel any similar things, but they still live with my mother in a house full of junk. I want to help my parents, they're divorced now, but I want to help them. Has anyone gone through something similar? Is there anyway to help?

So anyways, back to this 2017. I'm gonna start meditation, connect with my family and long-time girlfriend, focus on studying, maybe start a local rock band with friends. How about you guys? What are you guys planning?

"*wave*

I'm unsure where to even begin..

It's almost 2017. I'm 22 years old. I wake up every morning and regret the first and last breath of every moment from then until sleep carries me away, back into a dream world where my problems don't exist..

I'm struggling with things.. My memories just feel like I'm looking at a glimpse of somebody elses past.. I can't even focus on time accurately anymore. Everything seems to blend into one at times to the point that it's hard to recall whether things happened one day or another.. 

I have no purpose, no meaning in life, outside of living for my family. That's the one saving grace, I'd be long gone if they weren't around. But.. the longer this goes on the more I question the futility of living this way.. Selfish springs to mind, I would rip through their lives and leave an unfillable hole if I ever managed to muster the courage and end it all.

On top of this mental nightmare, I have no friends, I hate my job, my boss is a textbook asshole, using his position to self promote his importance and bring everyone else down even further. I've managed to be trapped in a life where work is the only social activity I partake in.. I play video games occasionally, but always alone. Socially, I'm inert. I can't help but feel if I had more friends and some semblance of a social life, my problems would be alleviated slightly.. but I've tried to no avail. I struggle with making friends, more-so any good ones. I can only reminisce of the times before I pushed them all away it would seem.

I feel the longer I stay here the further I drift ever closer to the end.. Looking for a job to no avail, the added failure stacking more onto an already miserable existence.

Don't get me wrong, suicide clearly isn't the ideal situation. Even I understand that there are bound to be things in life I enjoy, love even, that I've never even experienced.. but one person can only take so much before they snap. Even if it's in the pursuit of happiness.

People outside of this debilitating illness don't understand. I'm not sure many of them ever will. If I was asked ""Do you want to die?"" It's an easy no. Well why then? Because I'm tired of the crying, I'm tired of spending days in bed forcing myself to eat to avoid ending up back in the hospital.. There are no words that accurately definitively say what I feel, none that would provide the insight so many need to understand this shit. I'm at a point sometimes where I want to end it just to illustrate how I actually feel.. So people will finally understand.. Actions speak louder than words after all.

Time will tell where I end up. As I write this, seeing my life outlined like this, I can't work out if I feel validated or like I've just sunk even further into the abyss..

I didn't anticipate writing so much, it wrote itself mostly..

Sorry if it bore any of you, I needed to speak and this is one of the few subreddits where I didn't think I would be judged.

Thanks for reading.",4,"I have no friends, I hate my job, my boss is a textbook asshole, using his position to self promote his importance and bring everyone else down even further. "

"Basically, I'm a girl who turned 18 in november. I've struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember (I started self harming when I was 12, but I managed to stop when I was around 15 or 16) and this year it's only gotten worse. My friends don't want to be around me anymore because they say I'm too miserable, or I'm ""always in a bad mood"". I suspect myself of having depression and I find it incredibly hard to get excited or happy about anything at all - I seem to have two modes of indifference or unhappiness. Recently (especially in the holiday season) my thoughts are consumed with how much I want to die, how much easier it would be and how little a lot of people would care. That, or many of my ""friends"" whom I thought the world of but I've since come to realise are only friends with me through circumstance, would suddenly care when they are nowhere to be found right now. At this point I have stopped trying to open up to my friends. I took a couple weeks off school last month in order to get my head straight and when asked why I hadn't been in, it very quickly became a competition of ""who has it worst"". I do have one friend who means the absolute world to me and I feel like I could tell him anything, but there's only so much you can burden one person with.
I've thought many times about how I could kill myself and I have written notes out for my closest friend and a few other people - at this point, it's just finding the courage to do it.",4,"My friends dont want to be around me anymore, I am too miserable, stopped trying to open up to my friends"
"This year has been complete hell for me I turned 22

I lost my girlfriend of 4 years she broke up with me by handing me the custom necklace I got her..

I fell thousands of dollars in debt from helping her with everything she needed from phones to car payments.

I met my best friend fell completely in love with her thought she felt the same way so I asked her out she turned me down. everything was fine (I just loved her company) until 2 weeks ago she started dating and I never really see her anymore and is now about to move away.... 

I'm stuck living with my parents who tell me how everything I do is wrong how I should have a 50k+ income how I should have moved out 2 years ago becomes it's easy to afford to live. I can't afford to move out alone I truly thought she loved me and we were simply going to get a apartment we even talked about it a lot to the point we looked at some..

I'm ending 2016 thousands in debt alone and depressed knowing there will never be anyone there for me when I need them my few friends I consider family and I would do anything for them (from buying tires to food to giving them a ride) and I like to think that they would be there for me... but this year has shown me that's not the case that non of them truly care about me...

I've been sleeping all day after work crying slowly realizing I have no one even as I write this I'm realizing that.

"I know we've all been through a lot this year. Some have experienced loss and others have been on the edge of their lives. 

I'm not going to be one of those people that gets super excited because its a new year because although its a new year tomorrow is still only Sunday. I've been reflecting all day unfortunately about the past year. The first half was pretty decent. I still had a wife and wasn't alone. Then the second half I lost it all. My wife, my car, my house and my family. I hate this so much. I've also lost a lot of friends that apparently can't handle someone who has depression which in my opinion is a stupid reason to not be someone's friend anymore.

My life's stock dropped a ton of points this year and I haven't been this depressed since my mom died 20 some years ago and I was abused. I miss the friends I had, but at the same time I guess they never really were my friend to begin with. 

Sadly, I feel like here at r/depression is the only place anymore where I can freely say how I feel without anyone else judging me. Without anyone else running away from me. If I posted this on social media people would just think I'm ""begging for attention"" when in reality this is simply how I feel. I hate knowing that I am always one to listen to what others are going though and able to sympathize, but that never seems to be a two-way street. It's as if I have some sort of disease and they stay away from me when I need them the most.

I also hate it when people say ""do it yourself"" ""build yourself up"" or my personal favorite ""you don't need anyone"" its so simple to say when you are the one that isn't depressed. I also hate it because I am a guy and other guys say ""you need to man up and stop being a bitch about this"" 

I wish I had an actual friend outside of here. I've resorted to Tinder and other ""dating"" apps but I suppose I'm not attractive enough either. 

Oh well. I'm just glad this year is over. Time to move on I suppose.",4,"lost my wife, mom died  20 years ago and I was abused, they never really were my friends, I wish I had an actual friend."

"Kinda a long post. And I'm sorry. 

I've spent majority of my life following in other people's footsteps or following a path someone else created for me. I've never really been given the chance to create my own footsteps.. until now. 

For the last year and a half I've been with a guy let's call Christian. He was great. Honestly. We never fought. We never really got mad. We always talked things through. We always made sure that we understood each other.  And he understood me. He knew me so well. He knew when I was having an anxiety attack and he knew what to say to coax me out of it. He knew how to handle my depression. And honestly I could say that for the first time in my life I was happy. REALLY HAPPY. It honestly seemed too good to be true. And i guess looking back it was.

In Sept he left to school. It's an odd school where he's on a boat and only has service at ports.  So I could only really talk to him every couple of weeks and only if he found wifi. Well most of his ports are small towns in countries that it's harder to find wifi. You can imagine how hard this would be. But we were managing. We were trying.  And in november I went to Spain to go visit him and everything seemed normal. But About a month ago he out of the blue dumped me. It was over text. He had called me earlier that day telling me he missed me and that he loved me. Then a couple hours later I got a text that turned my whole world upside down. 

I feel like a total wreck. It was so unexpected that I still have a hard time believing it. He left for sea shortly after and I've spent the better part of this month trying to survive. And while everyone around me has been supper supportive, I've never felt more alone. All I want is Christian.  And I want him to make the hurt go away like he always does. But now it's my turn to make myself happy.  And i don't know how. 

He comes home for semester break in 4 days and I'm not handling it very well. I don't want him to come back because just the thought of him in the same town makes me spiral out of control. 

This is the first time that I'll be able to focus on me without ever thinking of someone else when I make decisions. While I should be happy because it's a new chapter... I'm starting school..  moved into my first home... I've never felt more alone and empty. And the only thing that's been getting me through my day and keeping me asleep at night is my constant supply of weed. 

I literally have to stay high all the time in order to make it through the day. I have a therapist. I have a family. But I can't talk to anyone. I'm scared to open up because once I do I'm afraid I'll never stop crying.  

The worst part is he asked to see me when he's home so we can give our stuff back to each other. And talk about moving on. But I've let myself go so badly that im embarassrd to see him. I've gained over 20 pounds since I saw him in november. I don't want him to know I'm suffering. Or to know I'm dying on the onside.  But he will know as soon as he sees me. I'm an emotional eater. 

I'm scared. I'm lost. And I don't know how to move on. I just need someone to tell me that im going to be okay. 

Tldr; my boyfriend dumped my ass leaving me feeling alone and unsure of how to find myself and heal.

"It'll be 2017 in 49 minutes.

What a year 2016 has been. I lost my girlfriend of almost three years. The business I tried to get going failed before it even started. I got back in touch with the one girl I ever truely loved. Now we don't talk to each other anymore - but at least she found her someone, and she's doing better now. I'm not.

I don't have any friends to get drunk with tonight. So I'll be hitting the gin on my own until I pass out and hopefully I'll choke on my own vomit. But I digress.

What I was trying to say, apart from telling the whole world 'O how I'm sad, is that I know plenty of you guys and girls are in the same position. Remembering that we're together in our loneliness is creepily heartwarming.

Here's to hoping for a better 2017 - but it won't happen, right? So let's hope we find bliss in our sleep never waking up again.

If that's the case and she claims she loves this guy then what the fuck is going on? I can't keep doing this, she's put me through so much shit.

"I met this guy 2 years ago with whom I became best friend (although honestly I probably fell in love with him). He got back with his ex last year and since then I've just been spiralling down. When we're together, he keeps texting with his bf, and we barely have interesting conversations (we used to always hang out together and talk about everything). He keeps saying that he's my best friend, and he keeps saying that I'm very special to him, but he doesn't really act that way. Their relationship is long-distance and when he's with his boyfriend he barely texts me.

I tried distancing myself, but he's scared he's gonna lose me so he doesn't give me a lot of space. I spent last January-March severely depressed and ended up seeing a therapist. I managed to get out of the darkness, but these days I've been faltering. Especially since he's with him now for NYE and I'm stuck with my parents and I don't expect myself having a good time...

Lately we haven't spoke much and I was getting him out of my mind, but he sent me a picture of a gift his boyfriend gave him yesterday and my heart has been turned around. I feel like there's a hole, and yet everything is very heavy... I'm getting the same feeling I had when I was depressed. I keep getting the feeling I should simply ""break up"" with him, just tell him to go away, but when I think about that I start choking up and my chest just gets heavier.

Sorry this post is sort of messy and all over the place, I just needed to vent... It's hard, very hard.

"I just have no enjoyment in life anymore. I got out of a 6 year relationship about 2 months ago where I was cheated on. My confidence is rock bottom. I don't like the way I look. I have neglected my friends so I feel very alone. I am about to finish uni and I don't know what I want with my life now that the plans I made with my ex have all fallen through. I know that others value me but I don't value myself. 

I keep thinking about my last relationship and about everything I lost. I still can't understand how my ex could have cheated. It was so out of character and we had both agreed on numerous occasions that cheating was the most despicable thing you could do to a person. I want someone to fill the gap in my life which is loving someone and being loved but I have no idea if that will ever happen again which just adds to the feeling of hopelessness. Now I'm finishing uni I don't even know where I'd even meet someone new.

I tell myself that I am not depressed because I can snap myself out of the sinking feeling and sickness in the pit of my stomach but the fact that I keep returning to this feeling is starting to worry me. I want to say I can over-ride how I am feeling and logic my way out of it. I know that the way I am feeling is chemicals in my brain and how it's irrational and all the rest of it but understanding why I feel shit doesn't stop me feeling shit. 

I am making a conscious effort to speak to new people, to do new things and not to wallow in self pity but right now there are so few things to be excited or happy about and I am grasping at every little thing. Fake it till you make it though I guess.

"Something that has begun recently in the last 2 years is my overwhelming depression. I have a friend who lets just call Tyler. Its not his real name. A girlfriend called.... Maria? Sounds good. And a best friend lets call Shana. For the longest time I never had a depressed state, even when I was in high school. I always seemed to just be doing fine and that's mostly because I was good at something. Video games have been my life, they used to become my cherished center where I could always go to escape life for a few good hours and come back refreshed. Where I had so much fun seeing developers make these stunning worlds and querky characters. It gave me the best years of my life, now its become a hellscape of depression and sorrow. 

Not all games, Undertale was a big helper in my dark times. Yet to this day most games give me this bitter feeling. So the reason why is im not good at anything, nothing at all. In real life I have no talent. In my job im seen as the weakest link (in all 7 which i got fired from my last recently) because I am physically weak. I have an issue where I am unable to remember simple things but can remember the most complex passwords. I can't even remember my own name some days and I actually stand there thinking about it. I have no money and nor do I care but I was made fun of it alot. So video games was my big deal right? Unfortunately as of late my friends became so engrossingly good at it i can't deal with it.

My girlfriend can beat me at everything. Were having fun and I think its going to be a good time so we play Battleblock Theater for example. She always gets to the end on every single level, and gets most if not all the gems first. She uses these weird tricks and the thing is she has no previous experience before.....but she always wins. So much so she apologizes for it and rubs it in by saying shell let me go ahead..... like im a stupid child. Tyler on the other hand beats me at everything as well and makes it worse. Say a game like God Eater. I practice against a monster maybe 30 to 40 times. I even spent an entire day trying to master this fight against 1 creature. So game comes down and were playing with another friend but I die not once but 6 times. Hes laughing at me saying its easy and im a loser for dieing. He laughed even more pointing out he got an SSS rank (the highest) while i got a B..... cause i died entirely. I also play games like Overwatch and Killing Floor and even on those games he gets golds across the board and recently after losing on God Eater he flat out said ""Why do we even have you here?"" refering to our new friend getting the game, so he kicked me out and just now as I type they are all beating the final boss of the game with the new guy proving hes completely surpassed me....he uses my same weapon and all and called me ""Useless"" and saying ""I should kill myself"" .....i should, I truely believe failures like me should be euthanised. Make room for the great and the growing. If you have nothing at my age of 24 you should be removed from this earth and ground into fodder. im useless im garbage i hate myself i hate living and i hate freaking everything now, my life is just filled with failures and holding everyone back and im not good at a single thing no matter how hard i try or cry or sweat or work and nothing ever works out and even if i practice ghours after hours i alwys end up just being last dead last i want to win once i want someone to say i fucing matter at anything! WHY DO I TRY IF ALL I WILL DO IS LOSE EVERY TIME AND HAVE EVERYONE HATE ME BECAUSE IM A LOSER WHY CANT I JUST DIE AND BE DONE WITH IT!?",4,"girlfriend can beat me at everything, so she apologizes for it and rub it in saying she will let me go ahead like I were some stupid child, you are a loser, why do we even have you here?"
"I'm new to reddit as of today.

I dont really have anyone I feel I can connect to, so hopefully I can find someone here that is going through something similar. The few people ive talked to about it tell me that I have no reason to be sad because Im super high in my class rank, get high grades, got into a college with some big scholarships, and have been first chair hornist in my school band (or they say im just stressed out, which i am, but its just adding to my depression and making me feel even worse). Truth is, I have never really fit in or connected with anyone at school, leaving me with many shallow friendships and no one I feel I can trust. Work isnt any better either. Minimum wage for a shitty retail job and the only coworker who i got close to and who could understand me refuses to talk to me now for literally no reason given.

"In twenty-five years of existence, 2016 has had to have been the worst year of my life. I have lost nearly every friend that was truly dear to me when the year started. One stole a pretty substantial amount of money from me, another was that ones twin, another ridiculed and belittled me behind my back to try to get into bed with an ex of mine, etc. Although, a woe from the year before, I am also dealing with my best friend marring and moving across the country. Any thing even remotely romance related is a self destructive mess. I was introduced to a young women and her young son back in July. We talked for a while and I was instantly head over heels for this girl. The first person I had really been interested in after calling off an engagement in early 2015. I proceed to spend the next six months busting my ass for someone that only sees me when it is convenient to her, under the self illusion that she had just been burnt to many time and had suffered a rough enough home life that she would just take time to warm her up to the idea of something steady. She has done me wrong some many times in that time that I've lost count. Last week she calls me wanting help because they have no where to go. What can i do, put a two year old on the street? The entire time up until last night has been decent, then she drops on me that some guy is blowing her up because they went on one date and she won't go on another. Mind you, in the time I've know her, she's bailed on every single date we have had planned that involved anything more than hanging out at my place. We had plans for me to take them out to dinner tonight. Where am I? At home, with a bourbon on the rocks, being a burden on the rest of the Reddit society on New Years. Mean while, she is out with her ""friends"" and wont respond to anything. So, cheers to 2017. I hope for a fantastic year to anyone who has sat through my tears and maybe one not so destructive for myself.

"According to Spotify, I was in the top 1% of listeners for Counting Crows and The National for the year. That got me thinking and I realized, I only ever feel to music. Here's a few songs that I really connect with and maybe we can swap songs or something?

**Possibility Days by Counting Crows**

&gt; Now ""living in smiles is better"", you say but we carry the burdens of all of our days, so I'm scared that youâll leave and youâre scared that I'll stay. It's an impossibility day, but we only say half the ballet.

also

&gt; I said, ""good night, goodbye""
Seems like a good thing,
So you know it's a good lie.
You can run out of choices
And still hear a voice in your head
When youâre lying in bed and it says that the best part of a bad day
Is knowing it's ok;
The color of everything changes,
The sky rearranges its shade,
And your smile doesnât fade,
Into a phone call
And one bad decision we made.

I view that last section as the voice you use to lie to yourself, trying to make yourself feel less like shit. The former section is how I feel about friendships that shattered when they found out I have depression, or if they don't explicitly know then how they treat me on my awful days.

**The Watchmaker by Steven Wilson**

&gt; Eliza, dear, you know there's something I must say. I've never really loved you but I'll miss you anyway...

also

&gt; You were just meant to be temporary while I waited for gold. Then we counted the years and I found I liked having someone to hold. But for you I had to wait, until one day it was too late.

I've had relationships where I didn't really feel for the other person, but just kept going because having someone there is nice. I regret both of these and this song really highlights that regret to me.

**Shemovedon by Porcupine Tree**

&gt; So for a while, everything seemed new. Did we connect, or was it just biding time for you?

&gt; She changes every time you look. By summer it was all gone, now she's moved on. She called you every other day so savor it it's all gone, cause she's moved on.

I connect this song very vividly to a girl I knew who feigned interest in even just a friendship. I thought we had something and formed a strong crush on her but she started getting cold. I confronted her multiple times but she kept hold the position that it was all okay. Eventually I got confirmation that she was avoiding any conversations with only me, and I confronted her last time and just got the message, ""I'm sorry."" Now thanks to a unique name, every time I even see her name somewhere it feels like a punch to my gut. So this song makes me extremely emotional, especially the guitar solo.

___
**Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks by The National**

&gt; Vanderlyle, crybaby cry. Oh the waters a rising, still no surprising you. Vanderlyle, crybaby cry. Man, it's all been forgiven, swans are a-swimmin'. I'll explain everything to the geeks.

I listened to this album around when I was 12 (yet to deal with depression) and fell in love with it. This was always my favorite song off it and never really knew why. I still don't really know why but have at least kind of a reason. It's one of the few where I can bawl my eyes out to any day. Just the chorus gives a kind of soothing, understanding, almost loving feel? It's just pleasant.

Plus it live [is a tearjerker like no other and on my bucket list to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpRRRwCVsic)

"So at least i made it this far, finally writing something here after lurking for a long time. 

I'm not entirely sure why I am so sad all the time, there is almost nothing in my life I feel I can complain about. I was never bullied, I have a loving supportive family, haven't been sick in a few years so somewhat healthy(although i drink a lot of coke), average intellect, average height, skinny. I have such low interest in things that my little income is way higher than rent+food. I went to the movies 2x this whole year, no hobbies to speak of (Watching TV shows and browsing the internet is barely a hobby).

I tried finishing my Computer Science degree at some point but every year went something like: School-&gt;Work during summer-&gt;Some school-&gt;Depression-&gt;Quit school. Had quite a few hobbies that started out fun and engaging but then got boring fast so I found another one. Now I feel like I have spent all my options for short-time happiness and I'm getting closer to the deep end of depression.

Everything I used to love to do just seems pointless right now, everything I aspired to be has vanished, I'm still fairly young(almost 30) but feels like life is passing me by. I have never had a partner or even kissed someone and people around me are having kids and successful careers.
I have now had a stable job for a year and it is killing me. I hate that job because I find it so meaningless, it's just an entry level IT job but deep down I feel like I should be doing something else. My friend recommended me for that job and now they are firing him because I have a little more education than him. That has not made our relationship stronger, he says it's no big deal but I can't but blame myself somehow, and I can't just quit because the rent would eventually eat my reserves and I would have to move back to my mother.

I don't know where this rant is going, just feeling quite bad that another year has gone by and I'm going less and less out of the house. Depression has hit like a truck over the holidays and I'm having a hard time seeing anything positive happening in the near future.

"So, been a long time since I posted (used throwaway but now I don't care) Basically, I was really depressed, I self harmed and attempted suicide once. After a while I decided I needed some company so I got a girlfriend. That in itself is an issue so I'll summarize it. She and I were happy but she said she was still in love with her ex. Thats when I realized I wasn't really happy with her. I broke up with her and was genuinely happy. This was about a mont and a half ago. Depression was gone and I was the best I could be. Then my friends started saying shit behind my back, that I was a fake and didn't have individuality. Basically mean things. Besides my friends were still (and still are) best friends with my ex. Like all of them.I started becoming left out. they stopped talking to me. (Literally the only chat I have with another person is my one true friend (Who doesn't respond to any of my messages even though he talks in groups) the rest I haven't had a chat since beginning of december) I keep telling myself that its okey. That I don't need them. I am probably right, But it feels really shitty. And to top it all of, my depression is coming back. I can feel it creeping up.


Thanks for reading all this, You are probably the first people to care for me since vacations started.

"I posted about an hour ago in r/relationships about a situation with my roommate where he owes me $1000 in unpaid debt, and I told his mom about it when she came to visit.

Most people sided with me, and told me I was right to do what I did. This was a great boost of confidence, and I finally felt certainty in my actions after all the apprehension I've felt while dealing with my roommate's failure to pay his bills. 

Tonight, I decided to tell my Mom, Dad, and sister about my decision, certain that they would finally side with me and praise me for doing the right thing, and being assertive. I know that in the past they have sympathized with my roommate, but I wanted them to see once and for all that I'm not the bad guy for wanting to take him to court, or to tell his parents about the massive debt that he owes me.

Their reactions were...not good.

My mom buried her face in her hand and said, ""You *really* shouldn't have done that.""

My Dad fell silent, and didn't say anything. He had a look on his face that said, ""You fucked up"", though.

I started rattling off stuff that people told me on Reddit about how right this decision was, and how I'm doing the right thing, about how great it was that I was finally taking action, etc.

My sister stopped me though, and she looked at me angrily and said in a sarcastic tone, ""Wow, congratulations! Getting validation from strangers on the internet really makes you confident in yourself, huh?""

Why doesn't she see how right I am? This whole situation with my roommate is cut-and-dry, and I'm taking the necessary steps to fix it. 

I started reciting some of the answers I got (they were really well-written), but the more I spoke, the more angrier they got, until my sister's eyes bore into me like daggers, and my Mom was sort of just standing there laughing, in an exhausted kind of way. ""There's no going back now."" she said in a defeated tone of voice. ""What's done is done. You let random internet people tell you what to do instead of us, and you're going to feel the consequences of that decision very soon.""

My voice cracked a little as I desperately tried to convince them to side with me, until Dad said, ""That's enough. We're not talking about this anymore. You're making your Mom upset.""

Why can't my family just be proud of me? I'm clearly, *clearly* doing the right thing here, and yet my parents seem to be more concerned about preserving the peace with my deadbeat roommate than getting my money back. Their *son's* money! I'm the one they should feel sorry for, not him.

A lot of people in that Reddit thread told me that I care way too much about what my family thinks, and I agree whole-heartedly. I don't know how to stop caring about what they think, because right now, they're all I've got. I don't really have any good friends who will talk to me about life situations without tuning out, or ignoring me. I've never dealt with difficult life situations like this before, and I need all the support I can get. I try to do all the right things, all the time, and I can't please them or make them happy. Nothing is ever good enough. I apologize if I sound dramatic, but these emotions have a firm hold on me and I can't make them stop. 

I want people to know how much my parent's disapproval means to me. I know I shouldn't care, but I do. I might need some advice on how to stop caring what they think, because tonight, I felt like I *needed* them to tell me that I made the right decision, because I will be dealing with a pissed-off roommate for two months, and it would really help to have people in my corner to tell me that I'm not the bad person that my roommate is making me out to be.",4,"sister stopped me though, and she looked at me angrily and said in a sarcastic tone, ""Wow, congratulations!

"My parents and little sister left an hour ago to go to a party. Im home alone and have been walking around my house picking out spots in the house that are capable of holding a 180 lb male. I dont even know how to tie a noose and im going around laughing at myself while saying ""Thats no strong enough"" or ""That could probably hold my weight"". I got rejected a couple hours ago to someone who i now realize doesnt care about me. She claims to but I know she doesnt. She acts just like how Ive been acting for the past 4 years pretending to be happy whenever someone else is present. I don't think my parents would care if I did rid myself, every night I hear them talking about how stupid and worthless I am but during the day they pretend like they care alot. I know they dont. Funny thing is whenever I think about ending myself I dont get sad. I feel some kind of joy, some kind of hope. I have attempted to take my life 5 times so far (I will spare you details) however I have a different feeling about attempt #6. I think it might actually work, which makes me happier than almost everything else. I am lucky to go 5 minutes without thinking of suicide.

"So this is what happened in the past 6 months:

1. Lost my car to a hit and run
2. Lost my job due to an illness that's out of my control
3. Had emergency surgery to remove appendix and ended up staying in the hospital 3 days due to complications
4. Instead of visiting me, girlfriend dumps me the day I leave the hospital

I just need to build up the courage of not caring about others and how this might effect them. This world can't hurt me anymore if I don't let it. 

This whole things is after 3 of the worst years of my life. I thought my girlfriend and I were going to make it and someday get married, but that was also a lie... 

This world is just not meant for me, and I can't wait I finally get the courage to check out permanently!

"I finally got the guts to post this, especially because I just came from a new years eve party and it's 4.33 AM and i'm just in a 'fuck it' kind of mode, I need some motivational help.

I feel like im a fucking failure at everything I do, I just turned 18 2 days ago, and time keeps going and going yet it seems I'm always in the same shitty place.
I don't feel okay with myself, i'm kinda short, i'm chubby, and let's face it, no girl wants a guy like that in her life. I just got home from a party just like I said, went over to have fun with some college friends (crush included) and hey, look at that, she's drunk and is spewing the truth through her mouth left and right. I've been 2 months so far gathering courage to just talk to her directly ( we have a group chat on facebook and we talk daily, 24/7 ) and do something about but there's always that mental block of 'hey she doesnt want you you're a loser look at you', and when I finally am about to do something about it, she just starts talking about how 'she misses *name_from_guy_from_our_groupchat *' and shit like that. All that built up courage went down in mere seconds.

And it's not even the first time this happens, I've been this whole summer talking to one of the best girls i've ever met (we know each other for like 4 years but we only talked more seriously this year) and it really felt like she was the one but then again, all that courage i've been building that whole time back then went down again the moment I knew I wasn't going anywhere, seems like I was being friendzoned.
We still talk, I even met her again today in the new years eve party after I left my college friends, but it seems like one day she really likes me but then other days she just ignores me completely, like for example, she gets really pumped up and invites me to the cinema but then she cancels the next day, i don't know her deal. 

I think I'm way too nice and caring but that's just the way I am and I can't stop it that easily, but it's FUCKING up my relationships with girls because I want to be with them but they just assume i'm their good kind friend who doesn't want anything.

I always get motivated and say to myself 'This is the day/month/year, that everything changes, from now on, I'll go to the gym everytime I can and start acting a different way with people blablabla', it works for the first few days or weeks, but it just burns down completely and I end up doing nothing. Endless loop. 

People say you gotta love yourself before you love others, I really need help loving myself then, because I just feel like time is flying away and I'll end up dying single, which is literally hell for me because I care so much about relationships and friends. I'm really grateful for the friends I have, but I just want that one special person to share all my moments with...",4,"I'm short and chibby, gathering courage to talk to her directly, she dosent want you, friendzoned"
"dsAIm 18, about to be 19 in a month (Feb.1) and a male, if that matters. 

As im posting this its currently 11:50 PM right before the new year. Both my brother and my sister are out at seperate parties, while im alone in my room. I have no connection to my parents, i feel so alone on new years eve when everyone else is having fun. All my friends left for college and havnt kept in touch, and my only online friends are all increasingly harder to reach. I feel like i only push those closest to me away when i try talking to them about how i feel. I never go out and do anything, im either at home or work, and even though me and my brother are ""friends"" and his friends accept me when they come over, they never invite me anywhere, and i feel awkward asking if i can tag along. My mom rarely talks to me, my dad isnt good at being supportive (to say the least) my stepmom hates me one day and acts like were friends the next. When they try to encourage me to better myself its always in a degrading way, ""youll be 300 pounds if you dont change the way you eat, look at yourself."" ""You need to eat less"" ""youre a terrible driver"" things like that. Im not too fat imo but im not thin either, i have manboobs and i hate them, and i genuinely want to better myself, but its hard without support. For the past week or so ive just wanted to curl up in my bed and cry, and its only as im typing this post that im finally getting that release, i genuinely dont know where else to turn. I have an overwhelming fear of there being no afterlife and just nothingness after death that cripples me and keeps me awake at night which no one ive talked to yet acknowledges. I just feel like im in a shitshow and i have no one here to help me through it, and all i want is to be happy but it feels like that just isnt possible for me. Sometimes i think im happy for a bit, but i feel like ive just gotten so good at pretending that i even fool myself sometimes. All this is made worse by the fact that right before my friends left, for about 2 months i was genuinely happy, we all went out and did things and it was fun, but then they all left, and now i feel like that little taste of happiness only makes this pain worse because i know what true happiness feels like, and i feel like i can never achieve it again.",4,"bother and sister are out at separate parties, I feel so alone,  mom rarely talks to me, dad isnt good at being supportive ,stepmom hates me"

I spent so much time with my friends and they invited me to everything. I invited them to do stuff. We had a great time and we did everything together and talked to each other about everything. Now they have ditched me. I never get invited to anything. It's like they don't know me. I didn't do anything differently they just stopped inviting me to hang out. I don't get it. I'm not even depressed now I am just at the point that I don't care anymore. So now I have gone in one year from being kind of cool with everyone then being really awesome and fun and everybody liked me and I was invited to everything to now not being invited to anything and none of the people that were my friends caring to ask me to hang out. I didn't do anything different. I was myself the whole time.

"https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4q2zxb/im_going_to_kill_myself_on_123116/

I'm so fucking annoyed and tired of feeling like only 1/2 a person all the time, feeling a whirlwind mix of negative emotions but never feeling positive ones except in rare, fleeting circumstances. I don't deserve this. Maybe it's caused by childhood trauma, maybe it's genetics, maybe it's just shit luck, I don't know for sure, but I sure as hell didn't ask to be plagued with social anxiety and depression; I won't allow 2016 and how shitty it was to kill me. Yes, I became suicidal a month into it, yes I hated myself for most of the year and used self-deprecating humor to express how I felt, yes I started self-harming and cutting myself over the summer and did it more or less regularly for the rest of the year, yes my anxiety reached new heights and started interfering with my life and career, but what do I say to that? I'M FUCKING DONE. I have done nothing to deserve this. I've done some regrettable things in my life, but nothing so bad that would make suicide a justifiable decision. I want to taste happiness and ""feeling okay"" for once--and not just that, but for a long time; I know I'm naturally prone to feeling depressed and like shit, but that doesn't mean I need to accept it. Even if I'm going to die, it doesn't need to be by my own hand, at the end of a gun barrel pressed against the side of my skull. I want to have a successful and flourishing career, I want to have fun in my 20s's, I want to experience all that is, I want to fall in love. Deep inside my head, there's still that part of me who wants to sabotage everything I strive for, who wants me to kill myself, who picks up the knife and cuts myself, who tells me I'm an unattractive piece of shit who should die. Fuck that guy. I will not go gentle into that good night. I will rage, rage against the dying of the light. I will make 2017 my bitch.",4," tired of feeling like only half a person al the time,  caused by childhood trauma, may be gentics"

"She wants kids. I fucking despise children and cringe when one is around me. And I would have to have one around me every day as a father. I'd need to PRIORITIZE THEM over my own life. That's completely horrifying to me.

She's left. I'm right.

I drive her nuts all the time. I can't make her happy when she's sad.

I enjoy living a lazy, quiet lifestyle living off of SSI. I can't provide for a significant other.

I should be happy like this. I should be overjoyed. This way our bond won't be ruined when we inevitably couldn't stand each other any more and have an ugly breakup. 

So, why am I not? I can shrug off most rejections with ""she was too good for me, anyway"", leave it at that, and move on with my life.

So why am I not feeling any better when I can come up with a million more reasons why it would never work out in a million years? I know it's for the best. I've accepted it won't change. But it doesn't get better. It still hurts. And I never thought it would ever happen. My entire life I thought I was immune to this, because I never considered myself capable of falling in love in the first place.

But, here I am. And I still don't know how the fuck I ended up here. I still don't know why what happened happened. All I know is that I regret it ever happened. I wish I could go back in time and restrain myself and remind myself of the life I wanted to have, and not get this close.

But I didn't listen to myself. I foolishly let it happen, thinking it was fine. Never imagining it could come back to bite me later. But it did. I got too close. It got too serious. And now there's hell to pay. I have to carry this weight around for years. At the bare minimum. With therapy. And pills that don't work for jack shit. I may be like this forever. Some say it never truly gets better. It may not hurt as bad. But it's always going to hurt to some extent. And I don't believe people who say it'll pass. I think I'm damaged forever. And it's all because I was too goddamn naive to consider what might happen.

Is this the real reason why major lifestyle differences are such an immediate turn off and cause to break contact for most? Once political views and beliefs and values stop being a barrier, EVERYTHING does. It gets to the point where you want to stand by someone no matter how rotten they become. What vile things they do. Because you're used to doing it. Because you believe it's the right thing to do. And you won't listen if anyone tells you otherwise. It's the cruelest joke in the world- because you find yourself so obsessed and committed, and willing to do anything at all for someone, you can't stop loving them and move on, literally no matter WHAT happens. I could not have less in common with her if I tried. And yet, here I am. Hopelessly in love with someone who is never going to love me back. 

I never want to get this close to someone. Ever again. I don't want to feel pain and shock fresh ever again. I don't want to carry any more burdens around. The fact of the matter is, there's probably only one person in the world I was willing to consider breaking my dreams of living the free single life for. And she's not interested. All that's left for me is the idea and possibility of a life that I always wanted to live. And it doesn't make me happy. I'd give it all up for her in a heartbeat if I could.

Luckily for me, I have surefire female repellent, as if my very existence in and of itself wasn't enough of it. Apparently those of the female race think very lowly of men who pay for sex and want nothing to do with them, and certainly won't date them.

Well, screw 'em. If they don't want to give it to me, I am going to pay for it, in places where it's legal to do so. And then it'll be a damn sure thing I'll never find someone who wants me. Because I am going to tell ANYBODY who gets too close to me what I did. And then they'll make faces and run. I refuse to lie. How can you possibly love someone you're lying to and keeping secrets from? The entire relationship has a rocky foundation waiting to crumble if word ever surfaces. That's why I find it impossible to approach women. How am I supposed to say ""Hello, I am interested in you purely for your body"" and expect it to go over well? Because that's all you know about a girl at first glance. It's the only thing you COULD be interested in. But you can't say that. But lying is bad. And thus... the eternal dilemma. 

I should be happy. I get to live the life I always wanted to have. Going off to have legal sex with prostitutes. Doing whatever I want without any extra baggage to worry about. Knowing it all ultimately doesn't mean anything. It only does for a night. I should be overjoyed. My dreams will soon become a reality.

But I'm not happy. Because it's not what I truly want.

I can't have what I want. It's all merely settling for what I can have. Almost nobody gets to have what they truly want out of life. Even if what they want isn't something atrocious. But maybe it was an atrocious idea all along. Unconditional love doesn't truly exist, and I'm a warped human being who wants to believe it does.

I hope they legalize prostitution in the rest of America, besides Vegas. Maybe this never would have happened if there was just a more accessible place you could go to turn in your virgin card once you hit 18. Maybe I'd have been satisfied with meaningless one night stands with women sooner. Maybe I would have been spared all of this heartbreak and pain, and maybe I never would have gotten as close as I did.

But maybe I was going to anyway. Maybe it was always going to happen, regardless of if I wanted it or not. Maybe it was fate. Maybe fate really exists.

Or maybe none of this actually matters.

First day of 2017 and I already hate my life and everything.

"I've had depression for a while now and I've slightly lost contact with most friends. I decided to throw a party to get back in touch with them. I had a great time before the party. I had pre-drinks with a couple of mates and it was chill, I felt calm and like myself. I should mention that last month I was dumped and cheated on during a long distance relationship that last 7-Months so the girl I'm about to talk about is the first girl I've had feelings for since. Towards the party I wanted to talk to my crush who was invited. We've been friends for a couple of years and in the past month I've invited her to a movie and surprised her with coffee before Christmas. I've been warming up to asking her on a proper date but when the party started. I relapsed. I've been feeling great up to this point. I shut down, I was a shell the whole night. She was surrounded by guys all the time and I didn't even get to say hello let alone have enough courage to. I was isolating myself for most of the night, even when it's my own party. Friend's comforted me and wanted to help but I just shut them out. The countdown to 2017 came and I left to my garage. I didn't want to see anyone. People left around 1:30am and I said goodbye acting really appreciative that they came. I'm happy they came but not during the night, I just wanted to be alone. The next day I apologize for not talking and just let out my feelings for her. She just thanked me for the night and ignored what I said about her. Now my day is ruined because I overthink.

I know if i disappear she would not care. We talk almost everyday, play video games, and from time to time hang out as a group, but i know these things mean nothing to her other than a social outlet.

"I used to have a great social life.  Everyday after school and over the weekends I would hang out with friends, I even had a ""girlfriend"", and when we weren't hanging out we would text.  It was one of the happiest times of my life.  It was great until the next school year.  Our whole friend group was separated into different classes and we all didn't hang out that much anymore outside of school. At the end of the year I found out that my 2 best friends were switching schools, one for personal reasons and one for sports reasons.  When I found out I was devastated and wanted to switch schools for next year also. I looked at the school one of my friends was going to and liked it, so I switched to that school.  Ever since then it seems my life is going downhill.  I have a few close friends but we rarely hang out or text.  I don't understand how they can handle not seeing their friends outside of school.  My best friend lives in another town, so we never hang out, and my other couple friends live in the country far away from the subdivision I live in.  In our classes there is also a huge gender divide, so chances are I will never have a girlfriend through high school.  I spend all the time not at school on Instagram and Snapchat looking at my old friends hanging out and having a good time while I'm feeling alone.  I feel like I'm missing out on what should be the best years of my life.  I don't think I'll ever experience going to parties, having a girlfriend, or doing other stuff teenagers are supposed to.

"Too many things have happened in the past few days, weeks, months. My parents lost their jobs, I lost my relationship with my gf and she just moved out yesterday. I had to say goodbye to my father because he's moved away and I don't know if I'll ever see him again because his girlfriend doesn't like me. I'm losing my apartment, I lost my job, my best friend moved away chasing some girl, I'm still a fat piece of shit, but not to get too far off topic. Today I sat in my room on the floor where my bed used to be because my ex took it since she paid for it. I loaded my gun and held it to my head for about a half hour and just thought about everything and how completely dead and empty I am inside. About how I can remember as a child wondering if anything will ever get better. Sure some things have been great but it's always accompanied by things that are just horrible. I'm miserable. I wish I had someone to talk to. I can't talk to my mom because she would get freaked out about it. My closest friends I can't really even talk to about shit like this either. So here I am posting on the internet about how much I hate myself. I know I'll never really commit suicide, i know I'd rather just float through life and hope something becomes of it. But every day is so hard not to just give up. I've lost damn near all of my friends. I'm getting older and losing time to fix my problems. I just think that if I can't find something to make me happy soon I don't know what will happen. I think I'm so stuck in my past I can't see my future. I normally can be self composed but fuck it's just getting to me. I'm miserable and I hate myself and i just needed to vent to something.

"2016 has possibly been one of the worst years in my life, at least emotionally-wise. Yes, I've been progressing with my exams, I even got a part-time job and started saving something, but that's all that I've been doing.

Last February my GF left the country to study abroad. Little did I know, I went to visit her in April and she broke up with me 10 days later. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions since then, and all I could do to keep me sane was studying and working. I didn't pursue any personal hobbies, apart from some sporadic gaming. I've been literally preparing exams and working almost non-stop and most of the time I went to bed very late. My soul has been sucked out; If I didn't have to work anymore and I finished studying, I wouldn't know what to do apart from staying on the computer. This new year poses some early choices I have to make. I want to do my thesis and continue saving money with my job, but I don't want to be working and studying without any free time anymore. I don't know how to live anymore.

I feel like I need help, but I don't want to jeopardize everything like I did with my ex by exposing my insecurities. I feel that exposing my sadness would repel everyone around me. I feel my problems are too silly. Heck, I've been putting off this post for months now and I stopped halfway my stream of conciousness because there are far more serious problems to discuss about here than some indecision, burn-out and post-breakup trauma.

"I've been seeing my boyfriend, let's call him Danny, for a few months. He's great, a real sweetheart, very funny and smart and communicative. I really love being around him. He's also severely depressed, and has been for years. He's on medication and sees a therapist.

The fact that he is depressed doesn't bother me, lots of people at my university are, and he's had a very hard life so it's not all that surprising anyway. But sometimes he does really reckless shit that I don't know how to react to in a helpful, supportive way. Specifically, tonight (NYE) he went and got suuuper drunk with some friends and wound up eating a bunch of vitamins and then forcing himself to throw up. I know this because after Danny sent me about a dozen completely unintelligible texts, one of his friends took his phone and messaged me to tell me what was up and reassure me that he was okay.

My knee jerk reaction was anger - that he would drink so much when he knows he's not supposed to mix alcohol with his medication, and that he would do something so reckless. I mean, I don't know how dangerous eating a handful of vitamins actually is, but I've heard it's bad and so has he. And he's been very suicidal before, before I met him, so the general behavior just scares me. But then again, he probably was just muching on them because they tasted good and ya know, drunk brain. 

Obviously getting mad and yelling at him or whatever isn't going to help much though. Is there a better way for me to react that still makes it clear that he upset and scared me? Some kind of general rule of thumb for dealing with this kind of behavior? General advice? Am I over thinking it? Is this the wrong subreddit (my bad if so)?

I love the guy and want to be a good partner to him. I just don't know how. Thanks in advance for any responses!",4,"Boyfriend severely depressed,  his reckless behaviour, knee jerk reaction anger"

WeÂ´ve been dating long-distance for 3 years. He used to love me to the moon and back. HeÂ´s from NZ and IÂ´m from Mexico, heÂ´s 22 and IÂ´m 31. He had already broken up with me 3 months ago saying that his feelings for me were fading away but he already had a plain ticket to come see me for November. 3 days ago he broke up with me saying that he needs to be alone, that he needs to figure things out, that the distance is too hard (We were planning on me moving there in 2 years until he finished university) we already had been through 3 years together, 3 very hard years as well where my father died and I lost my mind to depression and anxiety. He says he doesn't love me anymore at least not like a partner but that heÂ´ll always love me as a friend. Could this be the depression? he says he doesn't know what he wants and that he just wants to be alone. I don't know what to do here since I was working a job that I didn't really liked but that would give me lots of job opportunities in NZ i was planning my future around him. I battled depression as well and the last thought in my mind was breaking up with him. Which is why I canÂ´t understand why he broke up with me. He says he needs all his focus on himself to get better but I didn't need that when I went through depression. ",4,"long distance dating, broken up, dosent love anymore as partner"

"All of my life I've struggled to fit in, which coupled with lots of stress and anxiety drove me to depression. I was incredibly lonely, spending my days sleeping and staring into a screen.

This year gave me hope though, I met the most amazing girl imaginable - intelligent, funny, sweet/kind, romantic, sexy, same interests, everything I've ever wanted. She was the first girl I've ever dated, someone who actually saw me as something other than the ugly, awkward guy. I actually planned to kill myself around that time, but it all went away after that. I was the happiest guy in the world. 

That all changed though after she suddenly attempted suicide a few weeks ago. Now all she does is push me away when I try to be there for her (going as far as to dump me) and refuses to see anything beside the negative no matter how much I try to reassure her. She's like an entirely different person now, definitely not the same girl that told me she loved me every night. Meanwhile, I'm even worse than I was before.

"Well let's start from the beginning so at least someone will know the whole story. I've had depression since I was 8 years old. When I was a kid I was tortured by my entire school. I've been suicidal since I was 12, struggling with addiction since 14 and I am now 23. I've lived my life in a giving manner. Always making sacrifices to help others. I have been feeling lately that I have dug myself too deep to get out. Shit really started to go down hill when I was 17. I was in a happy loving relationship with a girl. It was fantastic we were best friends and shared everything. However she was 2 years younger than me and when I turned 18 her parents called the police. I did 180 days in jail I'm a registered sex offender until I'm 33 and on probation until next February. A little while after I turned 19 I feel in love again with a girl who I had a crush on since the ninth grade. We had a daughter I turned my life around I quit using and for a short period I didn't hate myself anymore I didn't even want to die. God I miss that. I worked nights slept a couple hours and watched my daughter all day while my fiancÃ© was at work while going to school online and managing all of our responsibilities. She left and took my daughter away just before thanksgiving just out of the blue. I tried to get her back. I fought I did everything in my power to get her back but she will not listen. I just want my family back but that will never happen. So tonight I will jump off a bridge into the Mississippi River. I'm done with all of this every time I try to dig myself out I dig the hole deeper. I just wanted to tell someone before I jump to get all of this off my chest and not feel so full of anxiety so I can live my last day with my daughter peacefully. Thanks for all of the laughs and dungeon ideas Reddit hope you all do better than I did.

"Hi, I'm extremely sorry if this isn't allowed but I have gone through depression all my life and this is honestly just a breaking point for me. I'm a 19 year old female going through a really hard 1 sided breakup. We were together for more than a year, I miss him more than you could ever imagine and my emotions are all over the place.. He stole around 300$ from me right before he left and has done so many horrible things but I can't help but love him. I made a few mistakes after he did and he said this was the reason. He wanted to have a friends with benefits relationship right afterwards.. I almost fell for it because I wanted him. I felt empty before and I just feel completely numb and empty now, I don't have 1 second of happiness anymore and I just don't want to live through it. The pain is so fucking BAD. I miss how he made me feel, physically and mentally. 

I take medication for depression, see a therapist, and have extreme social anxiety. He helped me so much and I have nothing to hold onto anymore. I'm seriously broken.

"I've gone through deep depression in university from being homesick, in addition to being in remission for testicular cancer for over 3 years. I met this girl through a close friend of mine out of state. We met once and connected really well, and wanted to stay together even through long distance. She told me her feelings were genuine and I shouldn't worry about anything, and that she would not be the one breaking up with me.


Fast forward 2 months to last night, where we met up again, to which i feel that she may be avoiding or distancing herself for me. I would ask if everything is alright to which she would assure me nothing is wrong. I see her texting a friend at the show we were at where she sent a text to a friend saying ""I'm a horrible person"". I kinda figured what may be the case, and confronted her to which she slowly admitted that she's not looking for a relationship. She booked the same flight home with me to stay with and visit me where I live with my family.


I don't know where to go from here. I'm 22, been through physical and emotional stress, and I wear my heart on my sleeve too much. I am going to talk to her soon about the situation but I don't know if I want her coming home with me now. It feels humiliating to describe this amazing girl you just met to friends and family, only to be abruptly let down before we could actually spend quality time together IN PERSON. I don't know if i can have her come home with me, it's so heartbreaking to know the person you fell in love with doesn't feel the same and is right in front of you.

For most of you, my thoughts might be nothing... it is very important to me.

I come from a very hard family. I grew up to hate alcohol because I saw my father drunk been horrible to my mother. And generally I was socially awkward. Even that, I was quite popular at the Uni. I dont know if it was the the long hair and my exotic colour but I knew loads of women were interested in me. But I couldnt do anything.

And that is what destroys me. As everyone had their crash in uni. What destroys me it is that, some of those crashes that I had, I knew they were interested in me. And I could even sleep with some of them.. but I never did. I was virgin and still was 2 weeks ago.

"I guess I'll start off by saying that I've been dealing with depression about eight years. It has peaked in the past, but I'd say I've been mostly positive since then. About one or two days out of every month it hits me with reminders that it's still there.


Today is one of those days. I woke up next to my girlfriend (who I absolutely love) and I just feel like I'm always worrying about doing/saying the right thing.  When something bothers me, I tell her. No matter how small it may seem. It just helps me get things off my chest and out of my mind. She hates when I do this, because she thinks I'm trying to pick a fight, and argue over something so meaningless. She tells me if roles were reversed, these things wouldn't bother her. 


So how do I even deal with these thoughts? I can't just hold them back, because then it's obvious something is on my mind. I can't just push it out of my mind by rationalizing it, because I'm constantly worrying. I also feel like there are so many guys that would love to have her.

"I want to help my papa, who suffers from obvious depression.

He had a pretty tough life: loosing his mother when he was young, my grandfather made him drop out of high school to start working and earn money to leave in the house. He worked from 16 to 45 years.

He had a meaningful job where he met my mom, who left the company a few weeks after starting dating him. At some point he was ""promoted"" but not really, and left the job shortly after.

Long story short: he popped from job to job until 45 yo, and have been unemployed since. My mom works and earn enough money to feed us (although some months this becomes an issue), but her job takes her away from the family for like 2 weeks straight sometimes, which obviously she hates.

At 55, and unemployed for 10 years, my dad feels depressed and guilty for not being able to give my family a better life. He tries really hard to look like he is ok, but he is depressed like noone I've ever seen.

Yet I hate myself so much. I have no energy for anything anymore. I usually sit in a chair by my computer watching my screensaver thinking of what to do with myself. I wanna watch a movie to pass time, but i find watching movies too boring to even bother.  
  
I work out at a gym and have for a few years, its a routine i enjoy while doing it but as soon as i step outside im all down again.  
  
All I want is love, a girlfriend, someone special. And I have tried. A lot. I ask girls out, I hit on them going out. I casually talk with girls I meet. But all I've ever gotten is rejection from those Im interested in.  
  
I have no motivation for anything, literally for anything. I should see a psychologist I guess but it costs money and it's a hassle to get to one so I postpone it.  
  
I dont see any point in anything anymore, I have no motivation. I find the few friends I have boring and cant bother with them anymore. I cut all the good ties I have because I dont find any joy from them so soon I'll be all alone, but I have felt that way for a while now already so there wont be a real difference.  
  
I see no point in bothering with anything anymore, nothing brings me joy anyway. The only one thing giving me happiness is the dream of a girlfriend, a relationship with love, but all I ever get is rejection, and Im probably not sending very good vibes so can I really blame them?  
  
Im not suicidal, I dont believe in God or afterlife so not living is a waste. But right now my life is just as much of a waste.

So I sleep in the living room while she is with another guy. That doesn't bother me at all. She cheated on me though that I didn't even care when we decided to split up for good. 

I can't get a job right now cuz when I try to she does something to make sure I have to watch the kids instead. Like leave town for 4 days. Her boyfriend refuses to watch them. So I'm such at the house. 

I barely talk to my family cuz of some issues we had a few years ago. Read my posts and you will know. So they won't help me out. 

I never get time to myself and when I tell her I want to get out of the house she pretty much threatens to kick me out and take the phone back they I'm using. So i rarely get to go anywhere.

My dad always told me in order for you to be happy, you must be positive. You need to do good things for other people. You need to be a good person. So, I decided to change who I am. 

Over the course of the last three years I've donated to several charities, I've helped in food drives, and much more. When I went to Africa a few years ago, I gave away several supplies and food to less fortunate families living on the beach. Every year, on holidays, if I'm doing something such as getting my haircut, I'll give them a pretty generous tip. (~$20 tip on a $14 haircut)

I used to run a depression help and therapy sessions for people who wanted to end their lives. I've met amazing people and helped many people get past their biggest fears/ problems. Don't get me wrong or anything, I'm very thankful for those experiences and friends I've made.

But really, the last three years of my life have also been the worst time of my life. I lost my first true love. A five year LDR, and we'd finally met in the fourth year. But ya know, of course, she ended up cheating on me with her best guy friend, that I told her I was worried about losing her to. Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯ FML. 

I just started college this year, got very close to my roommates. Felt very fortunate for the new friends I had made. Halfway through the year, we realized that one of our roommates had been stealing our shatter (for dabbing. thc concentrate). Which has account for more than $300 total. He also stole my friends juul (an e-cig), he won't admit to it and of course wouldn't buy him a new one and/ or give it back. The other roommate is very stingy with money, so of course, the generous person I am, I bought him a new one. Mind you I already bought him new juul pods (juice refills) a week prior, because I felt like I wanted to contribute and help him pay for it, since I've used it a few times before. 

This winter break my roommate, the one who owned the juul, let me take it home with me. Of course, at the end of the trip, flying home, I stuck it in my front right pocket and somehow it ended up gone. I always check the seat pocket in front of me and my seat after flying. So, yeah, I'm going to buy him another one. 

Realistically, the money isn't that big of a deal. I mean, I am a college student and my bank account is going down, down, down. However, it's really starting to get to me with all this negative-luck. Honestly, in the past i've wanted to kill myself, and with my luck, I wouldn't doubt I'd accidentally kill myself. 

I don't know how to get this shit to stop, but it's really starting to get to me. I don't understand how I can be a pretty good person, and be so goddamn unlucky; while people like my sister, who are complete assholes, do nothing but strive.

"the last year has been awful for me. my wife dumped me early in the year and moved with our son abroad for a few months. Subsequently, as a result of my bad emotional state, I lost my job. I got kicked out of the house we were renting and later had to leave a flat I rented (neither was financial reasons) and had to move in temporarily with my parents and have slept on the couch in the living room for a few months now, not getting enough sleep and having no privacy, but I have no alternatives. I got depressed and I'm on antidepressants. I also got pretty sick, some significant limitations, surgery was on the table, still might be, but hopefully not. Also, I had the worst phases of tinnitus in my life recently and it drove me insane. I have 2 favorite hobbies that I need my right hand for, but I got a nasty inflammation in my right hand, so I can't do my favorite hobbies. I lost a solid 35 pounds in 4 months because of depression. I felt better recently after being on antidepressants, found a girl that I like a lot and we had a trip planned, long distance relationship. I was looking forward to it for a long time, but I got sick again today and had to cancel and since this was the week when she had time off from work, God knows when there'll be time again. I also worry that I will lose her for some reason now, being pathetic as I am atm. And I feel like that was the last drop. I sincerely don't feel like going on after all of this, there is just no point in anything anymore. I'm so disappointed by getting sick again after struggling with health so much lately. Disappointed by not getting to spent intimate time with this girl again. I spent a month in bed just now and I'm already sick again. Wife started pushing hard for divorce on Christmas eve of all days (we were keeping this for when things calm down a bit, as it's just a formality to us at this point). Today she visited my parents and went full passive-aggressive on me, brought back bad flashbacks. My mom, who's my closest person in all of this... we have a slightly complicated relationship. She's kind of a low key feminist and she has a tendency to take my ex's side by default, identifying with her as she is also a divorced woman and she never entirely dealt with that. She was pretty cold today in communication with me after my ex's visit today and it got to me. And I apparently can't sleep, so I took sleeping pills and I'm starting to feel super sleepy as I'm typing this. Also, I noticed I suffer from forgetfulness and have trouble concentrating or falling asleep after starting to take antidepressants, which scares me. Overall, I'm just not sure anymore. The only positives in my life atm are my mom's support and being able to look forward to spending time with this girl and both things just went out the window and I feel like... what's the point in going on? IDK if there is any, IDK. I have to stop typing now as the sleeping pills are taking over, but just believe me when I say that this isn't even close to everything that has brought me into depression, it was just an awful year for me in many ways. Even with antidepressants and therapy, it's all too much now. Way too much. I find my self thinking over and over again that I don't want to have to do this anymore, I just wanna die. I can't get hospitalized or anything like that for this depression, as I need to financially support myself, my kid and my ex, since I'm the only one making money and I don't have anybody in my environment who could support me in any way in this regard. I just don't want to anymore. I wish I could get 3 or 4 good days, just a break and have things go well for a change. But I've been wishing for that since a long time and yet, here I am.

Thanks for reading.

_________________________________

I have been searching that particular person for years.

But apparently, I seem to be carrying a curse with me.

Every time I feel like I found someone *(and hopefully, not because I am desperate and because sometimes I want to say ""SOMEONE, NOTICE ME!"", and there were indeed times where I felt that she was ""the one"", so to speak)*, then all of a sudden ... **POOF** ... she is gone and out of my life

Could be because she found a spark with someone else.

Could be because that when I tell her who I really am, when I remove the mask to hide what I have to go through everyday, she slowly starts to become distant.

Could be because she was not who I thought she was

Apparently, I feel like I seem to be carrying a curse that whenever I feel like I finally have happiness, or finally have my own sense of peace and tranquility ... everytime that happens, I **KNOW** that it is too good to be true because after a while ... it just disappear and I am back to square one again.

*And this is not just about looking for a girlfriend only. I feel happy for a day and later, I am told that I failed a test or forgot to wash the dishes which later made me up fighting against my roommates. I thought that I found a friend, but later on, I found out that they only want to be with me when they are alone or when they REALLY need me. Or when I feel like I can handle my own emotions, all of a sudden, an accident happens*

It's almost as if fate itself wants to punish whenever I find that short period of happiness and tranquility. It always wants to find a way to take from me.

"How do you deal with depressed parents? Should I recommend they talk to a therapist or a doctor? She tells me the only reason she lives is because of me, her son. I know if I left, it would devastate her, but I want to live in a different part of the country, on my own.

"I'm young.So are my parents but I can't stop thinking that one day they'll be gone and so will my grandma whom I'm very close with. It brings me tears to me eyes every single day and night. I know death is a natural part of life but for some reason it tears me apart

I have depression so that doesn't help. My doctor has me on meds but nothing seems to work 

I know for a fact ,obviously, that if I don't die before my parents or other family members do I'm going to be alive for the death of them. It's just a really scary thought

I know I'm lucky to stil lhavd my parents as some people lost one or both of them. I just don't know what I'm going to do without them.  Even as am adult I would be so distraught and lost in life without them. It's killing me 

It's something everyone goes through so I hate to feel so shitty about something that will happen regardless

I try to make the most of every second im with them but when I'm with them I can't help but thinking the same thing- they'll be gone one day. It feels impossible to think anything positive and it sucks. 

I don't know how to stop thinking so negative but I pray and wish every day that these negative thoughts would stop flooding my mind so I can actually enjoy time spent with them because they could be gone anytime and I'd regret feeling so sad around them

"I have horrible depression and anxiety,  and have for as long  as I can remember (yes, seriously).  My friend has depression and anxiety as well,  though not as bad.  She is constantly texting me ""come over,  I shouldn't be alone"".  Sometimes I can't even get my own shit together enough to get out of bed,  yet I'm some how the bad guy if I don't come over to her place.  

I like going out alone if I go out,  she always wants to go out with her other friends and such.  That's fine.  But where are they when she needs someone?  I can't be constantly reassuring her that everything will be fine and agreeing with her so she doesn't flip,  when I'm sitting there thinking about ways to hurt myself when I get home or if I can slip off to the bathroom and find something to hold me over.

"Got married at 25 to my ex (then 23) after four years of dating back in 2014. She called it quits by March 2015 after less than a year of marriage. She moved out in April 2015, and I've had very little contact since last Summer. She finally got around to having us exchange divorce paperwork a few months back, and on Jan 12 we'll be having a quick trial for a no-fault divorce.

This was never a separation I wanted. I went from marriage counseling directly to weekly individual therapy last year, though I had found it unhelpful and stopped going after a few months. I feel like I annoy my friends when I try to talk to them about this, and there's always stuff going on in the back of my mind about this. I just want out of this mess, but I know in two weeks that even though there may be some legal closure, emotionally I'm not optimistic that things will be final. As a 28 year old guy, I hate that so much time has past and I still feel stuck and like shit.

"For the sake of brevity, I will not go into too many details here, but here are the basics.  Over the past few years, my mother's mental health has deteriorated drastically to the point of suicidal.  It is now at the lowest point and she has tried multiple times to commit suicide.  She had health insurance for when she had her double mastectomy early in 2016 but my father quit paying for it.  If she had health insurance, the doctor said she would have been put straight into inpatient care but instead she was urged to go to outpatient.  This is just not a possibility with her at this moment.  There is no way she is capable of going to get help herself and I do not know what else I can do.  I do not have much money as I am currently a college student.  I do not know exactly what are my options to try and get her some help and it has been difficult finding the right path to get her some help.  If anyone knows of a way to get some low cost options or even just a general direction for me to look, it would be much appreciated.  I am really struggling here because I can not give her the full time care she needs to get better.  Thank you for listening and have a Happy New Year.",4,"mother's mental health deterioarted drastically, afther quit paying for health insurance, really struggleing"
"Today I was sulking around because I really wanted ramen but if course, since it's New Year's Day, nothing is open. I was already hangry, had made myself some chicken in the oven, but set the heat too low, so it came out frozen. I was fumed and was ready to cry because I was so hungry and just really wanted some ramen. And, because all we've been doing this weekend is going to parties, we didn't have food at home. 

My mom was really annoyed that I was sulking and she asked me why I was feeling the way I was feeling. I just told her that I felt I was a 5 year old that wasn't getting their favourite food for dinner and that I'll be fine after I finish being sad. And then she said ""well maybe if you stopped sulking so much you wouldn't have depression."" after that I told her to fuck off and that what she said was an insensitive thing to say to anyone who was depressed and that she was lucky I'm not suicidal. 

I'm trying to let go of this situation now. Trying to cheer myself up by watching some Graham Norton, which usually works, but now there's this huge tightness in my chest and I can't breathe properly.

My mom has always been, and for as long as she doesn't open her mind up a little bit, she will always be the most frustrating person to talk to about my depression. I'm so happy I'm seeing a therapist, because in all honesty, I have no one to talk to who will understand without being frustrated.",4,"tried cooking ramen, it came out frozen, mom was really annoyed and sulking, said insensitive things "
"Ever since I started college (I'm a junior now) I feel so different than the person I was in High School. Back then people would tell me that I was funny, chill, nice, I was genuinely interested in people and made friends easily. But now I feel the opposite, like I'm just a dick, I never want to hangout with my friends and these are guys I have been best friends with since I was 5. We were literally inseparable, but now even keeping up with them in our groupme has become a chore, at this point my friends don't even want to talk to me anymore. Recently even the thought of having a social interaction is so scary that when it actually happens I feel like I seem distant and uninterested causing people to dislike me. I wish I knew how/why this all started, I just want to be me again, not this boring asshole who never has anything to say. I haven't told anybody this because I'm afraid they either won't believe me or think I just want attention, and I really just don't know what to do.

"I am 18, Korean. I have been suffering from depression for 4 years now. And things are just getting worse. Parent's are obsessed about my future uni and I can not give them what they want. No matter how hard I try, everything turns out wrong. I leave home at 7:40 AM and comeback home at 1:00 AM and during that time I study, study, and study. But my grades are not getting any better. I started dozing off everywhere, whenever since 2014 and it is not getting any better. I punched my thighs so hard during classes to keep myself awake and since then there are always bruises all over my thighs.

I think my depression started because I was lacking of affection. MY mother always wanted more and I couldn't give her what she wanted. She never encouraged me but scolded me because she thought I was not trying my best. She wanted me to be awake until 12:AM so I study like every other sons and daughters of my mother's friend but I couldn't. So I had to stand up and study in front of my mother. At school I took depression test (My middle school made me do that every year) and obviously my test's result said I have very low self esteem and I am suffering from depression. My mother found the paper and asked me about it and I could clearly see disgust in her eyes so I had to tell her I misread the questions.

I asked my friends for help at 2013 and my mother got so embarrassed about the fact I want to die so bad and I told others about that. And she screamed at me because I made her embarrassed. 

2014 I took depression test again and my teacher helped me a lot. He offered my mother to make me meet the counselor. My father disagreed, claiming everyone gets moody sometimes and I am acting like a baby. (But he never treated me like a baby nor child. I had to do everything by myself since my parents were busy taking care of my younger sister.) And my mother supported me for few months until my father told my mother it was a waste of money. I started to sleep a lot because I didn't wanted to anything and that's when I started to doze off.

My mother bought me liquid medicines that is good for my health (according to what she says) but I didn't want to drink them. So she grabbed my face and poured it into my mouth. She stopped doing that when I chocked on it and threw everything up.

I did cut myself few times and my mother was so embarrassed about my existence so I didn't have to go to church or big family meetings.

I also got bullied few times and my parents did not give a fuck. They claimed I was being to gloomy.

I don't have friends, I don't have any talent, my grades are getting lower, I hate myself so much and I don't even have courage to kill myself.

I am sick of my life.

"I've stood on my family's apartment balcony numerous times, grasping the railing and imagining the rush of air and short impact of the ground, sometimes, in bed, I imagine how easy it would be to just grab a knife and push it in. Other times, I put a pillow over my head and cryâ I hate myself for doing that; most of the time, I don't even know why I'm feeling that way.

I'm not feeling it though, I've put more effort into this rant than into any of my college essays, I don't care about my future, I've managed to achieve the lowest grades of my life in the first semester of senior year.
 I lied to my father the other day; he called me a ""fuckface"" and a""piece of shit."" He constantly reminds me of how lazy and spoiled I am, I never live up to his expectations. He always ends up shouting and swearing at me.
Water has always been a big part of my life, performing well in a recent meet brought me a feeling of elation I hadn't felt in a long time. I am lifeguard certified and teach kids how to swim.

"Well first off 2016 has actually been the worst year of my life, and not because of celebrity deaths (Although Bowie was my idol). To star off the year my special needs aunt who was only one year younger then I (I am 22) died of breathing compilations due to chronic pneumonia. She had the brain functionality of a six month old baby, but we all loved her and we knew it would happen sooner or later.
Then not long after that I had to quit my job, drop everything and use all of my savings to go help my mother because she has a bad heart and it has only been getting worse. At that point in time she was in the hospital and they didn't think she would last the month. She ended up OK and is still around. I really didn't want to go because for my entire life she has been an alcoholic and a drug addict, and how she got her heart condition is an overdose of meth that blew up her heart. Thankfully she has pretty much given up the meth.
I was living with her for about four months all of the while being belittled and degraded by her boyfriend who stole money from me all of the time despite the fact that it was me paying for everything. Her friends weren't much better. Eventually I had enough and I moved back here to to live with my grandparents as they needed help because my grandfather had a stroke and later became for the most part paradise. 
That was the next part of this year that destroyed me. My grandfather due to the strokes and a few other things ended up getting dementia and it got so bad that eventually there was nothing left of him. For most of my life he was the only father figure because my parents were terrible people. He died in his sleep in October. It was also around this time my battle with depression (something I have had a problem with my entire life) started to get much worse and I started to make plans to kill myself.
I only have a few friends and because I was having problems and was distant at times they all started to push me out of their lives until I pretty much begged to be let back in. These are still the people I hang out with, thankfully it has gotten better with them. At the same time my boyfriend (I am bisexual if that matters) dumped me because of my depression. We were planning on moving in together and I was going to propose.
I am writing this because I can't sleep or I don't want to sleep because tomorrow is my eighteen year old and four month pregnant sisters funeral. She was killed Christmas day at six in the morning trying to get to our grandparents house for Christmas. She was hit by a car and was dead on impact. She was the only person I could ever %100 trust with anything, and I am afraid my mother and grandmother are next to go and I don't think it will be much longer because of their health.

Summary: Aunt 21, grandpa 70, pregnant sister 18 died and I am afraid my mother and grandma are next because of health problems. Ex Boyfriend (I'm bi) I was going to propose to dumped me because of my depression. I was used by everyone I thought I could trust, and I tried to kill myself a couple times.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I truly don't know how much more I can handle. I have to be the pillar of strength for my family and I have been for all of this because I hide how much I am hurting. I just wish it would all end and honestly the only reason I haven't been able to kill myself yet is because I am terrified of death.

"April 2015. My sister took her life. 

It's been almost 2 years and I sought help a little after she passed. I fooled everyone, including myself, that I was slowly but surely getting better. Truth is, I just kept it locked away, like I always do. Recent events in my life have opened up some wounds, and I'm realizing the depression I felt 10 years ago in high school is still there. Feelings of being a failure, feelings of letting people down, feelings of not wanting to live are resurfacing. I'm not saying I want to take my life, but I don't want to live. Suicide would be cruel to my loved ones because they would have to deal with that twice. But if I didn't wake up tomorrow, I feel like that would be the best from everyone. I'm a miserable person, I'm selfish and I'm toxic. But I'm charismatic and I've hidden all this away for so long so no one knows my true pain.

The truth is, I basically killed my sister. I know that's what many family survivors of suicide say, but I knew my sister had some troubles. She was sad, she had been caught cutting and making suicidal threats for the past couple of years. And yet, I chose to ignore the warning signs because ""If I could get through it, she could."" My dad and her got into an argument one night, and I didn't help her. I even said aloud to my brother, ""She's going to kill herself one day."" A month later, she did. If I wasn't so selfish, I would have helped her, but I just wanted to get on with my life. I'm seeing now, all I bring people is pain. I'm venom.

"Hello I'm new here, I signed up in hopes to vent my feelings. Christmas has bought up a hole new wave of depression. Last year (2016) I lost my best friend 
, he was the sort of guy who I could talk to about this stuff. My bestfriend used this site daily so I thought  I may also find comfort in it.
What keeps playing on repete in my head, my daily  thinking is my best friend.
I wonder what happened to him on the day I lost him, what was he feeling?why didn't he call Me?
He always said he didn't want a dramatic death but jumping off a popular suicide spot in the south East of England seems pretty dam dramatic.
Did it hurt I ask myself? Was it quick, or did  the sea catch him and hold him hostage, like a rag doll he would have been thrown around and smashed up against the rocks. Did he think of me? 
Was he high?drunk?....IDK
Just why didn't he call me or leave a sign, just a week earlier he told me how I was his soul mate, and I  believed every word. He said how we would get a house together when we are 30 and still failing at life. 
I wish I could talk to him, hug him,hold him, smell him.  We were planning  on meeting up for a weekend, we hadnt seen eachother in 4 years...we stl called most night but life had just taken us to seprate ends of the country in different directions. If I didnt leave home at 16 to move further away would he still be here?
I know none can answer these questions but the pain crushed me and I just need to get my feelings out, perhaps one day I will look back at this and it will hurt less or not at all.
I have a tattoo for him, the delta actually. It ment change, I have no idear why I got it but at the time I wanted apart of him on me. Change? Why didn't it work why couldn't he use his tattoo and that way he would still be here. 
His mother told me he was drinking still excessively  and all he wanted was to be perfect for when he meets me again....but.i could have helped. I did not care I was his help why would he not trust that.

I moved to another city to live close to my university and she started to move in with me, because her work is very close to where I live now. I left my friends behind in the other city that is like 2 hrs away. 

My girlfriend has to do an internship in another country to finish her study. She will be gone for 6 months. She left 1 month ago and I knew it was going to be hard for me because we have been together almost every day for a long time. I feel lonely and sad because I am afraid that she might leave me. We are not that much in contact since she left. She said tons of stuff like 'I miss you, I love you' but this has stopped. She now ignores me on Whatsapp and she doesn't have time to call or facetime. She goes out at night like 2-3 times a week and she did not do this when she was home. I am too scared to confront her and ask her about this because I have always felt really insecure and she told me a couple of days ago that she is sick of me being insecure.. Which makes me even more insecure. Right now I have 2 weeks break from school to prepare myself for upcoming exams and one very very important resit. But I feel so sad and lonely and I feel nauseous all the time. I can't sleep at night and stopped eating. I am stressed about my relationship and I am stressed about my resits and it gives me panic attacks. I just feel like I have to tell someone about my story, this is why I put it here. ",4,"depression, lived with girlfriend, she went to another country for an internship,  acting distant, scared of losing her, panic and anxiety"
"I'm so incredibly stupid to ever think that this person would appreciate positive attention. I should've never cared about a person in the state that I'm in because it has made me so fragile. I know that this person receives a lot of negative attention, and it made me feel so bad that I started caring more about this person than myself. I would go to lengths that would have serious effects on my life just to help this person. It has always been hard for me to trust other people or even have interest in other people, but this person started to feel like a friend to me.

It shatters my heart to know that I was never appreciated even after spending so much of my life trying to be a friend for this person when a lot of others wasn't. I already had major difficulties showing interest in people, and after being rejected like this I don't know if I will ever be able to.",4," hard to trust or have interst in other people, shatters herat to know I was never appreciated, rejected"
"The notes that we exchanged during my last few days at that high school, as well as the hug that you gave to say goodbye and farewell stayed with me. I carried it in my wallet, travelling towards my senior years in high school to the end of college. 

Perhaps you were kind. Perhaps you were pitying me. Perhaps I misunderstood what you were trying to tell me. I can't speak or think for you. So when I wrote you a message telling you how I felt, you read it, and you never replied back, deleted me, dropped me; completely eradicating my existence a year after I left, I still held that note. Did you hold mine?

I would appreciate a response from you, even if it's this late in time. I just want to hear it from you. Why you spent time with me, and why you wrote me that letter. What was the use of being my ""friend""?

I told myself I'd burn this note that you gave me once I've become happier. I'm going to burn it soon, not because I've become happier, but because I don't think I ever will.",4,"would appreciate a response, want to hear , why spent time, why became my friend"
"I still remember that image of you and him so close together in that hallway alone. It burned itself into my mind. I get it though. I wasn't as athletic or good looking as him, nor was I popular. My grades were slightly below average, so that didn't help as much. I know my situation before and now isn't your fault at all, but my whole experience with you was just terrible. I tried to look at the brighter side of things before. So, from what I've learned:

1. Don't get close to anyone that fast
2. She doesn't have any interest in you
3. When faced with a difficult emotion, think of nothing and it will soon go away. Side effects may include lack of emotion of practised long enough.",4,"dont get close to anyone that fast, when faced with difficult situation  soon go away"
"I told myself to keep a fair amount of distance between myself and anybody back in high school, but you don't really change much when you get in college. I fell in love, and I tried to push out that thought. One sided on my part completely.

Before that, you and I were really close. But it turns out you were the same as anyone I tried to get close with. As soon as we get close, the further away we became. I wasn't oblivious to people pushing me away back then. I knew the signs, I know how to read in between the lines. So why give me mixed messages?

The amount of stress that whole thing caused me thinned out my hair. I already hate falling for someone, or in any case get too close with just about anyone, and then I had to trust you. I shouldn't have. I should have just kept you at bay like everyone else. Later on I knew that you slept with a friend of mine. 

I wish I hadn't met you at all. I wish that we never talked to begin with. Thinking of you only causes me grief, just like everything else.",4,"fell in love, one sided, mixed messages, grief"
"I'm starting to think about it a lot. I have no skills, I have no hobbies and I've never been happy with any job.

I was happy with her for three years and she told me she loved me like no other then five months later is dating some other guy, I saw a photo of them together before the new years.

She was probably just using me, she most likely cheated on me multiple times - certainly once since she gave me chlamydia. I loved her so much I had never felt so safe and happy or secure in my life until I was with her and I believed she was the most amazing woman I would ever meet or had ever met.

I was kicked out of school young and I lost all my friends with that. I have been trying so hard for this past year to put myself out there and meet people but got no where. I feel so alone. I feel so sad. I am starting to lose confidence that I would never actually end my life I've thought about it since I was a child and always told myself I would never actually do it, life is full of possibilities but death is death.

I don't care about possibilities any more and death is sounding more and more like relief and peace of this emptiness.

"I'm sorry if this post don't really make sense, I just feel like, I need to get this off my chest.


I am fourteen years old.
About half a year ago I was in the worst possible part of my life
... until now I feel.
I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and OCD, I was hospitalized for a few suicide attempts. 
Back then I used to feel horrible. I wanted to die.
When I was hospitalized I met this girl. I thought she was the most beautiful human being.
We talked one day, and I quickly found out, that she was the most beautiful human being inside and out.

Fast forward a few months.
We've been talking quite a lot, and I've gotten to know her.
I felt like she was losing interest in talking to me, if I would not start the conversation there wouldn't be a conversation at all, and so I decided to ask her out. We went to the city and just walked and talked for three hours. It was the best day of my life. She seemed so glad to see me, and I felt like she had a really good time.
The next day it went back to normal, she doesn't really answer me, if I talk to her.
I'm so scared, that she has completely lost interest in me and my existence, and I'm not sure what to do...",4,"depression, anxiety, suicide attempt, liked a girl, asked her out, went to city, best day of life, dosent anwer"
"My wife completely dismisses my depression and also tries to tell me its just an excuse. If I am having an off/bad day she says I am just being an asshole and am trying to ruin her day and sometimes she even goes as far to say that I am ruining her life. I have times when I am down that I cannot be as attentive or give her 100% of my attention, but if I try to say I am just having an off day she says I am just trying to find an excuse for my behavior and not taking ownership of it. There have been days where she says she wants me to get out or leave and I have wanted to, so that I can get away from the pain, but I never do and I end up staying and hoping to just work things out or that maybe I deserve how she treats me. The only thing I feel is really keeping me there with her are out kids, who are the light of my life. I am just not sure what to do and what is going on with me, maybe there is someone else who has been through something similar and can offer words of advise.",4,"wife dismiss my depression, only thing keeping me is kids"
I know I sound weak a d pathetic for this but my parents are splitting and I have no idea how to even cope with it. I am losing my hope and I don't know how even face a day. At the moment I think the only way out is to kill myself and I don't think anyone would care. There is really nothing left for me to enjoy maybe I deserve to suffer and kill myself...,4,"parents splitting, losing hope"
"It started around 3 years ago. When strange things happen just to make my life worse. Even if it affects others. 

My relationship with my family isn't that great. We never do anything, my dad is just lazy and for the most part only wants to watch tv or YouTube. My mom has a neurological disorder that makes her sleep a lot. But now I believe that she's just being lazy as she has gotten better. I believe that if she change her sleeping routines and go to bed and get up at the same time every day she won't sleep as much. Then she can seek a new job and start working again. She worked as a teacher before. It's quite stressful so that could've been the reason her disorder worsened.

When it comes to friends I really does only have two. But one of them is a bit shy and for the most part only wants to play computer games. And the other one doesn't have so much time to hang out with friends. Anyway one strange phenomena was about 2 weeks ago when we had the opportunity to choose who we would want to learn a ""Just dance"" dance with. We could choose to be 2-4 people per group. I didn't really get into any group so then I asked my closest mates if I could be with them but they were already 4. So they said that i could go to the group with 3 people. But I didn't, it did not feel right. So next lesson we wrote down who were in which group. And we started arguing in which group I would be in. But the group with three refused to let me be with them for no reason. It's strange because I used to hang out a lot with two of them before. Many of my class mates was on my side and started to get angry and upset that they refused to have me in their group. But they had already decided, it was impossible to change their mind. Soon a mate that I've known for a long time who has always been supportive let me in his group. And now we were five in one group. The strangest thing of all is that the two mates who were in the group with three. We are still going home together as usual, joking around and just having fun.

Now in Christmas time my cousins have been here celebrating Christmas together. First my younger cousins were here and just as they were leaving my older cousins came. At first everything is great and all but then my cousin who is two years younger than me is starting to get annoying as he always do and questions everything you do that he think is strange. And when you try to argue with him about it he's too stubborn. So you cannot prove him wrong. But what is most annoying is when he always does as you don't want. He's 13 years old but behaves like a three year old who always do the opposite as you want. And the worst thing is that I can't just leave him. If he comes to visit me he will stay for a long time. 

At New Year's eve. We were left at home with our grandpa while my younger cousin who's 11, my and their parents went to a NYE feast at my parents friends house. Me and my cousin needed to cook food for the evening so we did. Afterward we went to the city to watch a firework show. When we went home again we saw that my younger cousin was at home so we asked what she did home and she answered that their mom got drunk and dizzy. It was unbelievable because she never drink so much alcohol. Later at the night my younger cousin wanted to watch Netflix on her brothers iPad but he didn't allow her as usual and they started fighting I don't know what's wrong with him but he has some kind of disease. The fight went down intensively until my grandpa shouted at them to be quiet. Their dad hadn't got home yet so they called him and said that he needed to get home  instantly. We waited about an hour but he didn't come. We called again, he explained that it was hard to get a taxi at that time. But just as we hung up their mom came down and was insanely angry she almost threw our iPads on the floor. We instantly ran upstairs to go to bed. The next day my younger cousin was upset about what happened last night and screamed that she was an idiot. She didn't get angry and realized her mistakes to drink so much. 

I don't know what to do anymore everything just seem so meaningless. It feels like I won't experience a great life because of all the bad things that happen to me. I hope that you can find  solutions for my problems.

I'm sorry if I didn't use the correct grammar. English is my second language and I'm writing this on my iPad.

Thank you for your time, I really appreciate it!

"Im at rock bottom and I don't know where else to go with this so here I am

I've been depressed for awile now and there were some events today that got out of control, my sister broke a drone that I got for Christmas and my mom did nothing I got pissed and threw the controller and stormed back to my room my mom's solution tell me I'm worthless and she's tired of my crap &amp; shove my dog outside (which is the only thing that gives me happiness) we were supposed to go to town and go see a movie (just me and my mom) but my sister tagged along so my mom said we would go to Starbucks and then go to the mall instead which really pissed me off to begin with.

Christmas break ends for my school we go back tomorrow and there is more stress there I've been so pressured to get good grade my mom wants me to go to insanely good schools (Stanford, Duke, Vanderbilt) to name a few and they are good schools for engineering but the stress of keeping grades up is insane I leave school with a headache and a tight chest every day I have to get all A's &amp; B's taking honors and AP classes and if I don't I get punished

I really have nobody else to go to because my sister hates me for god knows why my mom doesn't care I've tried telling her I need help or therapy or something she just blows it off and I can't go to my dad because he passed away when I was 7 years old I just have nowhere else to go and I think it will help to just get this off my chest

Thanks if you read my problems I hope it will help to get this off my chest im just gonna try and get through these next few weeks and try to improve I know these are petty and dumb things to complain about but there has been a ton of stuff building up to this thanks for reading it helps me know someone cares

",4,"sister broke  remote control of drone received as present, mom shouted on me, screams on me, sister hates me, dad passed away"
"I don't really know where to start, because I literally do not understand myself, but I guess I just came here to see if anyone could make me feel a little better.

I have always been an anxious person, always one of those people who worries about the smallest things and blow it up in my head, and I have had bouts of depression but they seem to come and go. I think the problem lies in that I hid this well from my family having lived away for university for 4 years, and when I came home I felt so happy to be back with them, that they never saw me at my bad state.

I have been living at home since graduating, and all has been fine. But I feel I've completely fucked up christmas, having thrown a complete crazy on my family.

I arrived home from a trip to Slovenia with my boyfriend late on NYE - about 9:30pm. They'd waited for us to eat and mum had spent all night cooking. On the way home my phone broke, and for some reason it put me in a horrible mood - usually I'd relax about this but as soon as I came in the house my mum said to 'just chill out and leave it until tomorrow' and said 'it's because you treat these things badly' and for some reason it made me go CRAZY.

 I knew I hadn't treated the phone badly and for some reason i felt so angry that I wasn't allowed to be worried about it (because I worry about my family alot). But I completely overreacted, stormed upstairs crying and shouting about how much I care for them and how they don't care for me, and from then on the evening went MAD. They all ignored me which made me get worse, although from their perspective I probably looked a bitch so I get why, but it made me so mad so I started screaming and throwing things around (again, I have NO idea why I did this, I see RED when I get in these moods). My sister came up and tried to talk to me and said it 'wasn't worth crying over' which again made me mad and I was screaming and screaming about how they should care about my stuff too. She lost her shit then, slammed her door and went to bed. Then my Mum got really upset, packed a bag and went walking, saying she couldn't be around it (she has PTSD, and has struggled with it for ages). Dad followed her, they returned an hour or so later. When they returned, Dad came to speak to me, I confessed everything about my anxiety and bouts of depression and feeling sad sometimes, and that I was sorry. But then I heard my Mum and Sister whispering about me being annoying or something, and I saw red again. I stormed downstairs, started screaming and hitting myself in the head with scissors, and  screaming ""how come they don't give a fuck about me?"". Sister comes downstairs, grabs me by the scuff of my jumper, shouts ""if you don't fucking shut up I'll get you sectioned myself you're being pathetic"", slams me down on the sofa, so I slapped her in the face. I DO NOT hit anyone, never have, but I felt threatened by her and annoyed that she somehow just didn't feel at all supportive. But i get that it would have been a shock to her. She was pissed at me. Lots of crying on my part and we all went to bed. 

The morning came and everyone was so weird, although my Mum and Dad sat me down and said they would make me a doctors appointment. But I don't know if I need one? I have no idea why I reacted so badly, but 50% of the time I am completely happy. 50% of the time I worry like mad, constantly worrying about family dieing, or if they're happy, if my boyfriend is interested in someone else, if people like me, if I'm hated... alot.

But I have NEVER felt so bad now. I feel like I've destroyed the one thing I was certain on, my family. I feel like I've destroyed the happy, innocent view they had of me and I'm now seen as a crazy bitch. I feel like I ruined NYE and that was the last time we'll have together for a while, as my sister lives far away. I feel like I've just fucked up everything. I can't stop crying, I can't stop going over that night in my head, I'm not hungry, I feel hopeless, I feel like my family will never be the same.

And I know I am probably being irrational but I just feel so shit. I want everyone to be happy so badly and I feel I have hurt that, when they have other things to be worrying about and demanding jobs. Now they'll look back at NYE and hate me for it.

I know this is a really long story - sorry. But I feel completely alone and I want the tears to go away, because I feel very overwhelmed. I really wish I could go back to that night and act like a normal person, because if that was the case we'd all be sat around together watching a film and being happy, but we're not, and I miss that. It doesn't happen often anymore and I fucked it.

"Hello.

I'm not depressed, but my friend is terribly blue. Their life is crumbling and I can't bear to see them like this. I care about them very much.

I don't want to reveal much information and I hope you understand.

To summarize for you all: 

* They were involved in some deep stuff.
* Some time back, they got their house broken into and while fighting the intruder(s) off, they received an injury in their head.
* The injury increased the mental illnesses they had, one of them being Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
&gt; And this resulted a rise on violent seizures, traumatizing flashbacks, haunting voices that returned to the time they were in that deep stuff, not to mention that they can barely get out of bed.

* They tried contacting with their family and friends, they tried going to professionals for help for their bodily and mental dysfunctions, but to their dismay, they (the doctors) gave up in the last moment.

* Their friends just turned their back on them and they treat them unpleasantly.

I'm one of the few friends they have left and I'm distant from them in location and I don't think there's a chance I would be able to be with them.

What can I do?",4," friend depressed, house broken into, injured fighting intruder, PTSD, other friends treat them unfairly"

---


i had very much given up on feelings for people. a series of indifferent relationships and unenjoyable things had left me cold. i thought something was wrong with me, perhaps, and that i could not love or feel in love, whatever that means.

(i should mention i've had depression for the longest time (i'm mid twenties now)).

then i meet this person. they are the best at talking, we share so much in common; music, conversation, sex... everything. they're beautiful. and a weight is off my mind, i feel different about everything. i think about them all the time. i am creative again and i have feelings and the world is colourful again.

the only problem is, i know that they have to leave forever, and that my feelings are logistically impossible... there's no way to continue seeing this person at all.

we had talked about it. and i understand rationally that stopping everything right now is the healthiest thing to do... before any feelings get too strong.

but i can't stop fucking thinking about what might have been given different circumstances, though. i am torn up. obviously i didn't tell them all this. they need to be happy! and its not fair to make them feel any worse than they do... i want them to do what's right for them!

but at the same time... i want to see them again. i want to message them. i want to say all these things and hold them and see them and kiss them again :(

what do i do, internet?",4,"given up feelings for people, meet  this person, best at talking, share so much in comman, had to stop seeing this person, depressed"
"My life is a complete fucking mess. I don't know if this is depression, some undiagnosed mental thing, or just me being under the illusion I'm somehow special and need help even though my life is normal

I guess I've always felt some depression. I never really fitted in. I was always the most unpopular guy in school by a long margin and just kept myself under the illusion that I didn't give a fuck, I could sort my life out later and not worry about it. I have never had very many friends, if at all, in real life; and found myself turning online for people to talk to. I'm too fucking anxious to talk to people in real life. Over the past year or so I began speaking with a guy, my age, with similar problems to what I have now I suppose. We grew closer and closer, he told me he was transgender and wanted to become a girl. Cool, I'm totally ok with that, hey maybe I can support him during transition in the UK - he was in the US. Of course, it was kinda inevitable that since we were already so close we fell in love. I was 100% sure I was straight but it's the first time someone had ever shown love to me and I loved him so much, and we were determined to make it work. Over time we planned out our lives, I guess an escape from reality, and I felt I'd met my life partner. Over time though, I began feeling more and more shit. Some days I felt so damn in love nothing even mattered I was so happy and upbeat, some days I hated myself, didn't want to wake up, feeling empty. We broke up yesterday which, I'm not gonna lie, has contributed to this, but even before that, before then I felt bad, I was just trying to gloss over it. The breakup was on good terms and immediately after I felt relieved in a way. Now though everything is haunting me - thinking of anything we did together, listening to any music they suggested or even that I played while we were messaging causes me to literally burst into tears. I can't speak to them about anything without having an emotional breakdown. It's made me realize how alone I was, a reality check. It's made stuff worse but definitely hasn't caused it.

Right now I have one person I'd truly consider a friend in real life, and complete anxiety to speak to anyone else. I feel so damn lonely, this Christmas has been awful. I don't have many interests which makes it difficult, computing is probably my main and when anyone asks about that I honestly can't tell if they're being serious or just sarcastic. I used to trade stuff to make extra money but that became an obsession, buying and selling for even the tiniest profit, and now it all just seems pointless. I'm reckless with money, deep into savings parents lent me trying to ""start a business"" - ""I can easily repay them"". Nope, I'm thousands in debt already to a fucking emergency fund and I hate myself for being so naive into doing that. I've kinda lost my interest in everything now, everything seems pointless, and I'm just left browsing reddit pointlessly or watching youtube all day listening to the same repetitive music.

Even before then I had thoughts that I want to sleep and never ever wake up. That I hate living. Nothing truly suicidal - I could never face death, but mentally in a way - giving up, that everything was pointless. Sleeping is my only way to escape from the shitty thoughts I have, from anxiety in anything social.

Throughout the relationship I had what I called ""negative thoughts"" - what if I didn't love her, what if... etc. I put pieces together with something that has been going on throughout my life that I'm guessing is very mild ocd - pathetic things like triple checking the gas burners are off before bed, having to step on the same paving slab, type evenly on a keyboard - it's all very irrational and does not make sense but if I don't do it my mind says ""if you don't do it then so-and-so won't happen"". During the relationship this got bad as the thing I wanted most - the relationship - began to be the go-to for everything and I was literally double or triple checking everything, my mind insisting I did everything evenly. It's not happening as much now because there's nothing I want, inserting death into that situation has no effect.

These have also been complimented with always worrying about stuff, something I've had for a long time. Irrational fears. I can't tell which thoughts I have are real and which aren't. I've been worrying I'm gay, or I'm transgender, or I'm asexual, completely irrational since I've identified as straight cisgender all my life, and the thoughts will not fucking go away. I have so much anxiety speaking to girls it's making those arguments worse, and of course the relationship is like, even though I fell in love with her viewing her as a girl which she really is if he's transgender, ""you fell in love with her as a guy and of course that makes you gay"". I'm struggling to hold a conversation with friends for fear of going on or being judged, I can't even start a conversation with any girl about work or whatever.

Everything in life just seems pointless like there's no end, no point in working, no point in anything. I haven't done a single piece of homework, always excusing my way out of it. I can't concentrate for more than ten minutes. I have GCSE mocks in two days and I haven't revised at all - I just find myself getting distracted - then I cut internet and just fall into depression and crying uncontrollably. I'm gonna fail them, everyone is telling me I should be aiming for A*s but I'll be lucky to fucking pass them like this. We were meant to revise over Christmas and I've spent the majority of my time crying about self-pity, worries, loneliness in real life, regret, anxiousness, and lack of motivation; and then staying up until 4am to try make the mess that was a long-distance relationship work, not getting up until 2pm. It was fucking stupid, it's my fault, but I just keep putting shit off and once I do try to focus I give up. There's no fucking point.

I look awful, acne is covering my skin, I only started giving a proper fuck about personal hygiene properly as the relationship started so my acne is probably some of the worst ever, I can't see it ever going. (The only other treatment left that might work is this shit that has possible side effects like ""suicidal thoughts and depression"" and I worry shit like that is gonna push me over the edge). I'm stupidly tall, over 2m yet under 16yo, my body is a mess, I'm ugly as fuck and I can't ever see someone being attracted to me, ever. I'm awful at sport, I swim but have lost the motivation to because nothing seems to fucking matter anymore.

I don't even know why I made this post. It's a mess. I'm really hoping it's just getting over a relationship but seeing as this happened before it ended and in the past before I even spoke to this person I don't know. I just hate the fucking thoughts in my head telling me to do things, or irrational thoughts that I'm struggling to judge if they're even irrational anymore. I can't tell what's real and what's fucking with me. I can't concentrate on work, I can't hold a fucking conversation, there's nothing I'm good at, I'm the most unpopular guy ever and I'm worrying I'll never be able to get over this fucking mess I called a relationship let alone even initiate another one. Everything is pointless. My mood is constantly swinging between crying uncontrollably about everything, chucking everything on the floor, kicking shit with anger and self-hate, and then happiness and hope, rarely though. I started writing this post feeling awful, now I feel very slightly better, but I know I'm gonna feel worse in a bit.

I don't know. My life shouldn't be fucked up. This is probably just me being stupid and overhyping things like I always tend to do and I'm really fine but in the darkest times I know it's more than that. In the darkest times, every couple of days, I just want my life to end. Is it depression? I'm really not sure - I can't be sure on fucking anything it seems.

Apologies for this being an unjointed and unreadable mess, like everything I gave up halfway through but this time pushed myself to finish.",4,"always alone, met a guy who was transgender,  grew closer, wanted to spend my life, broke up feel empty"
"As the title states I think my wife is depressed. She won't admit that she is though, nor will she see anyone about it. 

We used to see a counciler together, but stopped because she claimed it was making things worse.

The whole story:
In March of 2015 we had to move for me to start my career, she was pregnant and the baby was due in a week. Before this we lived an hour from her parents for college and she went to her parents every weekend to visit, even if i had to stay to work. My wife was going to stay with her mom since they lived closer to the Dr we had been going to.

I started the job and my son was born the next day after my wife got rushed the the ER. Very eventful, but great day. Wife turned out okay and have a healthy son. After a week we got to go to or apartment, which is around a 2 hour drive from her parents.

Fast forward a few months, she started missing family, we've also been driving up to stay at her moms place at least every other weekend. Then in November after a few weeks in the hospital her grandmother dies. This drives her over the edge the first time. She talks about how much she needs to live in the country and not the city. How much she can't stand where we live and is crying most days.

We then look for a house in a rural area, I never planned on staying in the apartment anyway, but we were already in debt from moving down here, now we are moving again, luckily we managed to avoid a down payment and closing costs. We have nothing in savings, as we are constantly going somewhere, she thinks we need to go on a date, and she's to tired during the day to do anything so all we do together is clean when I get home from work. We are now living in the only house we can afford in a rural area. 

For a bit she is okay. Still need to go out, still visiting family(which is really just spending the weekend at her mom's house and she sleeps in, we don't actually go visit the rest of the family that she complains she misses and says that we don't see enough). 

About 6 months in she starts again. She's homesick. I don't know what to do. For a bit I was setting a psychiatrist and was getting help for my depression, but I just don't see the point anymore. The one I was seeing no longer works for the place I was going to so they canceled my appointment and I never rescheduled. 

We agreed to try and move to the half way point of here and her parents, but I don't think it's going to change anything, except put us in more dept and all she says is she doesn't care about the money. Only way I could think of to attempt to move was fix the crap wrong with the house we are living in and attempt to bring the value up. We still owe more than its worth and she just wants to sell it and buy a new place. We have a son who is about to be 2 and nothing in savings. 

Her mom does not help this either. They talk on the phone every afternoon and her mom always brings up how much she misses us and can't wait for us to visit. It'll only have been a day after we left their house. We don't really visit when we are there just stay over. Her dad works and her mom watches TV and gets on Facebook.

Honestly if it wasn't for my son I wouldn't want to be here anymore. My company offers life insurance and mine is at $20k that would go to her right now. That would be enough to bury me her to sell the house and get what she really wants which seems to be to live with her parents. 

She's also talked suicide and I don't know how to handle this. I feel trapped. If I say something the wrong way she snaps. I dread coming home from work in the afternoon. ",4,"wife is depressed, close to family, had to move, she miss her family , grandmother passed away, drove her to edge"
"I invited my friend Ryan to brunch yesterday since it had been a while since I saw him and I wanted to catch up. He is 16 and a junior in high school; I'm 17 and a senior in high school. Things were going great until he suggested we go hang out at my house. I drove him over and we went into my room. There was only one chair at my desk seeing as I'm usually the only one in my room so he sat on my lap - he is bi and I am gay so we're both ok with that. Then I started to go for his crotch and he told me to knock it off. I stopped for a while but then I went back in again, eventually getting all the way under his pants. A few minutes later he mentioned he had plans so I drove him back to his house and we went our separate ways. 

I just can't fathom how I could possibly do something like that. It was like my hormones just completely controlled me and my brain just turned off. What kind of person attacks their friend like that? And to top it off, I knew he had feelings for a girl at the time so i probably just fucked up their relationship. What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't normally have a high sex drive either. 

I feel so scared and guilty and I just want him to be OK. I don't give a shit about myself anymore. Now I understand why people self harm. ",4,"I'm gay, invited bisexual friend to brunch, touched him inappropriately, feeling guilty"
"I don't think I'm depressed but a lot of my very close friends struggle with depression and often times I am the one they tell their problems to. I don't mind this becasue i like being there for them but I feel like this in turn is affecting me and making me depressed. 
Now I often find myself contemplating suicide and other things in situations where previously I might not have thought so. Furthermore, I just feel generally depressed becasue I am constantly around people who have depression.
Is this a thing or is this just me not knowing how to handle my friends' depression? ",4,"friend depresed, feel depressed because constantly around depressed people"
"Hi everyone. I have a friend who has been diagnosed with depression. I have told her that I'm there for her on multiple occasions, but haven't been able to help her in any other way, at least one that feels like it's had a meaningful effect. Her performance in school has progressively been going down; the only thing that seems important to her is theater. Im sure you all know how high school theater is. Self-confidence can either thrive or struggle to survive in there.

I have tried to coax her into adopting a hobby like drawing, just anything to use her time constructively, but to no avail. Some days she simply chooses to stay in her room.

I'd be grateful if you could give me some advice. I just don't know what's going on in her mind and I don't want to lose her.",4,"friend diagnosed with depression, havent been able to help her, performance in school dropping, tried helping her, to no avail"
"Like woohoo life if awesome today cause I'm healthy, my team beat the blackhawks, I have a job, and the weather is nice.

"For half a year now I'm fighting a fight I can't seem to win. It's like I never even turned 19 this summer. I started university this fall and got together with the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. She was so supportive and caring that she was afraid to speak about her own problems. She broke up with me because of that a week ago. I made her feel worse, it's my fault she broke up with me. The whole second half of 2016 is a blur. Since I've been diagnosed with severe depression in August I tried medication and am currently in therapy. It kinda helps but over the past week I thought a lot. I don't think I can do this. I don't even know if I'm going to be alive at the end of 2017 - but I have to. It just seems so much right now. The break-up, depression, moving out, having no close friends at my university, no sure if I even want to study the subjects I'm studying. I don't know where to begin; where to start fixing this mess I made. I fucked up. I'm not sure what to do when I'm alone in my flat tomorrow evening. I don't even want to think about that situation. I can't do this anymore.",4,"got together wiith most beautiful girl,  so supportive and caring, broke up , depression, on mediaction and currently I  therapy"
"My friend keeps talking about his depression, but I can't tell if he really is depressed or is just going through a rough patch in his life. He still gets out of bed to hang out with us and he just graduated college. 

But he gets very emotional when he drinks, and is either really happy or really sad. When we all hang out, as a group of guys we all make fun of each other because that's what guys do, but are careful not to push his buttons too much. He broke up with his girlfriend who he cheated on a few times, but keeps texting her wanting to get back together with her. He always wants to talk about very sad things, and doesn't ever act happy when he comes out with us.

What I don't get is if he's depressed, wouldn't it be hard for him to get out of bed? He invites us over his house to do stuff, but then just wants to talk about how sad he is and it makes me and our group of friends not want to hang out with him anymore.

I've tried to help him the most, listening to him whenever he asks me for help, inviting him out, and offering advice when he asks for it. But he never listens to me, and just blames his ""depression"" all of the time, and it's really dragging my friends down (not so much me though because I don't let his feelings affect mine, but it does get exhausting having to listen to him go on about this.)

He says he's going to a psychologist for help, but that he hates going there. He hasn't talked to his parents at all about it, and refuses to tell his older sisters either, which is surprising because he does have a very supportive family. Their family isn't the best shape financially, but it certainly isn't the worst.

I feel like he's more so upset because he compares himself and his life to others, and granted things haven't gone his way all the time, but that's normal, is it not?

Please help me, is there a way to determine if he is depressed or not? Is there a way to suggest he find help? Or is my friend just playing a game with us to get attention?",4,"friend depressed, broke up with girlfried who cheated, did not inform family, hates going to psychologist"
"I'm not talking about someone saying ""Its all just in your head."" I mean how do you stop someone from flat out denying the existence of depression and anxiety.

My girlfriend's parents believe that depression and anxiety are merely excuses to be lazy. Unfortunately, my girlfriend has been diagnosed with both, and when things get bad, her parents actually are a road block to getting better. Her mother actually slightly understands, and lets her take antidepressants (which she hasn't actually been on the last few months because she is too anxious to go to the pharmacy) but when things go bad, she is on the brink of suicide, and her parents will yell at her for sleeping late, or taking too long in the bathroom, and it only makes things worse. I only want the best for her, and I think getting her parents to understand her situation may help.",4,"girlfriend has depression, parents dont understand, want her parents to understand"
"I'm 18 years old, been struggling with depression for about 2 years but it really surfaced the last few months.

I live together with my 3 best friends because my home is too far away from school. Turns out one of them stole about 750-1000 eu from my room + A LOT of weed.

I sell weed to get by because i was blown away by how expensive living on your own is. Now all of my money is gone and i'm 1300eu in debt by my dealer.

My gf was the only one  trusted and i (still) love her dearly. But unfortunately she broke up with me just now because she can't be with someone who has such a negative self image of himself, and because i was never there for her (i did everything i could but sometimes you just can't do shit because of the depression and she doesnt believe that). She also said that i am selfish and that the whole relationship revolved around me, wich was the saying that hurt me the most.

I completely lost track of my own to get her to feel good, but nah she wouldn't have it. Commenting on my best friend who is jobless atm but worked HARD everyday on roofs and such for 2 years, saying he's a loafer with no ambition and i will become the same as him got me running to my car, bawling like a little kid (wich is something that nearly never happened in the past 5 years, i'm pretty 'cold-hearted'). 

We just returned from a super nice city trip where everything was as good as it could get, wich gave me hope because i tought that might be the spark our realtionship needed (we've been struggling in our realtionship for about a month) but i guess she didn't think so...

Everyday i have this urge to just drive against a pillar or off of a bridge but i can always come to my sensen when i think about my parents, who support me A LOT.

But lately even that doesn't do the trick. I wake up and think about the best way to kill myself.

So; i try to escape. Benzodiazepines are my love now, but i know i gotta quit that shit asap. Unfortunately this can't be done atm. 

I'm too weak to do it sober.


I don't even know why i bother writing this because no one gives a fuck about me (except for my parents probably) and this'll get buried anyways.


I looked forward so much to celebrate my bday (14 january) with my gf in a cosy restaurant and its all gone to shit.


Sorry for the weird text, im fucked up on benzos and alcohol and english isn't my native language. This could be a goodbey, idk and idc frankly.

"So this girl and I have been talking a while and I slowly started liking her more, I have extreme emotions and the only one I learned to control was anger so my other ones go Willy nilly, I haven't been diagnosed because they don't know what to diagnose it as. She started off by giving very blatant signals, so we started being flirty etc I asked her out and the date is in a few days, she was my +1 to a new year's party and we cuddled most of the time and kissed and as she left I walked her to the car. Then I talked to her yesterday morning  and I haven't talked to her since but she has seen my message. I know I'm overreacting and over thinking but I can't get over all my stress and anxiety about it, I realize it's likely nothing but I'm very stressed out.

Update: were 17 so her mom found out there was pot at new year's and said she can't go on our dinner and movie date but we will be going on a lunch date",4,I haven't talked to her since but she has seen my message
"Hey guys, I am 16 and have been depressed for many years, but I started to make some huge progress a few weeks before New years. I started to eat healthy, lost weight, even went out a lot and hung out with some girls that I would have never had the balls to talk to before.

-

For some reason, I became confident, determined, and enthusiastic about life in the blink of an eye. Well that all changed when I woke up to an ambulance arriving at my house and carrying out my mom who had just collapsed. Me and my sister thought it was just a small thing, we did not realize that we would be in for the worst news of our lives when our dad got back from the hospital.

-

My dad arrived home with our grandparents and started crying as he explained to use that our mom had just died from a heart attack. She was only 49 and had no health problems. My whole family broke down crying as I just stood there in shock, I didn't cry, I didn't say a word. I just stood there with disbelief.

-

The second day of the new year, and I've already lost hope, as I'm sure my sister has too. I believe she died because of so much stress that a heart attack was caused, I know that she had been very down lately and I felt very bad for her, but I never said anything to her to explain that I was feeling the same. I feel like if I had just said something, maybe just maybe she would be alive, BUT I DIDN'T. 

-

Not only that, but I never got to say goodbye, I didn't get to hold her hand as she died. I didn't even get to go to the hospital or see her in the morning, I didn't even get to say goodnight the night before. All I can think about is how much I miss her, I just want to hear her voice one more time, go on one more walk with her, something. But I can't.

"  I have been adding to this regularly.   It has just become kind of a therapy thing for me.   So, I get if no one reads it.   If you do, I'm open to comments and suggestions.   If not, thank you for your time. 

  About 4 months ago,  the (39f)woman (37m)I love of 10 years went from ""I love you"" to ""I'm blocking you"" in the span of a week.  In a text at that. I have tried reaching out to her, but received only venom in return.  She was my life, my happiness, my fiancee,  and my drive. 
  The back story is long, and while I would love support and ideas, I don't really expect anyone to read this or care.  I just have no friends,  nor am I good at making them.  So, this is the only Avenue I can think of to try, nor am I a good writer.   Also,  this is on my phone,  so sorry if I miss any autocorrects.   So, here goes, it will be long, but, as this is more because I don'tknow what to do,  understanding would require a good amount knowledge of me.  While this is long, sadly,  it's only scratching the surface. 
  I suffer from depression and anxiety.   In the military is was diagnosed with Bpd.   I have never been popular or had many friends.   I try here and there to make them, I usually wind up being the target for people to make fun of.  It has become a place in life where I just fit in.  The doctor said my depression will never go away, and all I can try to do is mitigate. 
  To start, I was conceived due to my mom's depression.   While I was due in December,  she decided to force labor in Oct.   Unfortunately,  I lived.
  When I was 13, my parents divorced over drugs.  Both were in a bad place.  My dad told me if I didn't go with him, he would kill himself.   So, being a child,  I chose to live with him.  At that point,  we moved around to the point due to his contract labor,  I went to 17 highs schools.   Making friends became impossible.   
  Because he was strung out.  He was making me pay rent to live at home at 16.  My mom would not let me go with her because she was bitter.   So, went to school and worked full time.  Until I turned18, and joined the military 5 days later.
  In the military,  people come and go all the time.   So, I didn't make friends because,  well, I was used to that.  However,  I wound up being made fun of regularly .  Mainly because I liked to read dungeons and dragons books to escape reality.
  I went out and met a woman,  who I dated for 3 months before making the mistake of marriage.   While I was out to sea, her and her boyfriend cleaned out my life savings of about  $30,000.   I flew home for us to transfer unawares to ""here's the keys to your truck, I want a divorce,  goodbye.""
  I moved because I had to.  And met a girl who thought it was a fun game to mess with me.  Cheating and coming back crying.   Because of this,  I used to sleep with a loaded shotgun pointed at my head.   Finally,  one night, I was getting drunk and ready when.  When I had the gun in my mouth,  someone walked in,  and called the cops.  So I spent a while in the hospital. 
  I then met a different woman who got pregnant. So, I married her (46f)so she would have insurance for the baby.  Which was my oldest daughter.   The wife quickly got pregnant again and had my son just before I was out of the Navy.  She was from Texas, so when I got out, after 7 years in, we moved to Indiana.
  In the need to find work,  I took a truck driving job, where I received a letter in the mail that I had a 10 year old son.  Long story short,  the girl who took my virginity had gotten pregnant and never told me. I was hammered with support and much back support,  putting me in a position where I lost everything.   The woman only wanted the money,  and while I get I did the deed, after 10 years, I had made many choices this knowledge would have impacted greatly. 
  The wife, knowing I loved my children,  would then cheat on me regularly,  always threatening to take my kids away to texas if I didn't like it.   By this point,  I made little working in customer service.   So, I couldn't afford a lawyer.   And in Indiana,  men never get the kids.  So, she did whatever she wanted,  virtually holding me hostage to my kids.
  Then, I met this (39f)woman.  We became best friends.   She was engaged to someone outside the country.   We would sit and talk for hours.   We did everything  together,  and our kids did things together.  We actually had everything in common.      Her new husband,  wound up being a lazy mommas boy.  And while she tried over the next couple of years ,  he just couldn't be motivated to...do anything.   She then while I didn't notice,  started doing things for me like dying her hair blonde. 
  Her and I decided to try to make better futures,  so we went to ITT together.   After class, always talking for hours.   At this point we had known each other for roughly 6 years.   One night however,  it hit me.  Where I accidentally told her I loved her.   I knew I thought it,  I guess,  in a way where it wasn't my active thought,  but, I guess I didn't realize how powerful it was.  
  Some back story on her.  She grew up being made fun of also, suffered from depression,  and had a rather uncaring mother.  Her first husband who fathered her children abused her, and the second took advantage.   When I tried to make more friends,  she got upset.   So when I talked to her about it,  she preferred it to just be us.   Once I understood,  I complied.   More people meant more chances of getting hurt.  Once she felt someone hurt her, nothing mattered, they were the enemy.
  Over this time,  there was never a time she called me for help i didn't come running.   I actually liked helping her.  Seeing her smile,  just...made me feel good.    From helping her find a place to live,  to mowing her lawn because her husband couldn't be bothered.   I never once told her no.
  After I told her I loved her (call her k), with my wife being pregnant again,  things changed.   She told me she loved me.  We spent hours discussing it.  Like fate brought us together .  The wife, who had had more boyfriends,  one who's wife got her fired I believe got pregnant on purpose so I wouldn't leave.  I work, I pay bills, and I have nothing I can do about it. 
  I talked to the wife, and she agreed to let her move in for a 3 way relationship.   K then left her husband who moved back home,  and moved in with her and her kids.  This was not a bad thing until the wife got jealous.    I spent my time with k, letting her do what she wanted,  but anytime I was happy,  it made the wife upset.  So, eventually things bored over and k moved out and in with her mother. 
  The wife went back to her ""other"" friends while still threatening me regularly.   The relationship with k became mostly by phone and weekends since she was now an hour away.   Also complicated with poor Internet at her mom's, so messages didn't always get through.  Sometimes having to send multiple before she would get the notice.  This continued for a couple of years.   Though,  any time she told me she needed me I was there.   Bringing her and her kids with us anytime me and my kids did anything.  Hell,  if she wanted anything,  I would jump through hoops to try to make it happen.  To be honest,  anything that made her smile, made my day.  Our love, and friendship was what kept me going.   K also became attached to my youngest.   
  Before my daughter came, this year I was planning for a divorce as my kids would be old enough to choose.  And support for my son ended. However,  a couple of lawyers told me a judge won't split the kids, so she would get them. Then I wouldn't be able to stop her from moving back to texas. 
  So, in March, k told me things needed to change,  and she gave me some rules.   Like no ""relations"" with the wife.   I think I understood what she was wanting.    So I came up with a plan to give her what she wanted.   K was going through some rough times.   I had to give her what she wanted without stressing her out.  So, I didn't tell her about it. 
  I spent the next six months in solitude in the bedroom.   The wife sleeps in the den.  I needed to do a few things.  Make it easier on the kids to move away from me by making them indifferent towards me.  Make it easier on me by getting used to not talking to them so much.   Then buy time for support for the other child to end.  While having time to talk to a lawyer,  and start preparing for a divorce. 
   I checked with k regularly in order to be sure we were good.   For I was going stir crazy.  I ended up stressing out k.   I didn't realize that even though I grew up alone, how much being around her regularly meant to me.   Right at a time when her work and kids made seeing each other difficult.   I'm sure I was driving her insane.   I was trying to protect her, and in doing so screwed up.  I got jealous she was talking to her ex husband.  Jealous over trying to get time with her.  
  She was having trouble with the relationship with her son, problems at her underemployed job, car problems,  problems with money, among other things.   So I set out and worked on getting her a job that would have started last week that would have paid double what she was making. 
  In August,  support was over, I set up a date with her.  I had this big dinner planned.  Ready to tell her everything,  ready to tell her I was about to give her everything she asked me for.   I was as excited as anyone can be.  She canceled the first time because her son wanted to do something with her.   Since she was working on building a relationship with him, I got that.
  The next week was my son's birthday,  which I checked everything with her.  She promised everything was fine, that she was ready for us to finally be together,  and she loved me and we made love.   So I made plans for the next weekend with her, for telling her everything.    A couple of days later, I got into it with a lady from work to the point we were yelling.   I went to smoke to calm down, with a text telling me she was canceling because her son just made his first girlfriend and her family invited her over for dinner. 
  I screwed up.  I called and asked if she was blowing me off again.   She hung up.   So I screwed up again and called back like 20 times.   Finally,  we talked.  I apologized.  Then, that Sunday,  we're were texting and she just disappeared.   I sent a few messages over a few hours tryingto reach her.  One, my youngest wanted to talk to her, two, I wanted to tell her about a show, and 3, I wanted to remake plans to tell her about everything, that everything she asked me for was coming true.
  I woke up to a text, that I was smothering her, and that she was done with me and blocking me.   I was lost.   I tried to explain,  but was blocked before I could.   We had been best friends for 10 years.  Lovers for 4.  And all I got was a text.  I tried emailing from a couple of different addresses.  Sending flowers.  She told me to fuck off, and stop being a stalker.   
  I let the wife read my emails to her.  So she understands I will no longer be held hostage.  However,  k never either read them or cared.  She just went 180Â°.  I've never let anyone..in before.   It only meant pain.  She said I was a manipulating controlling jerk.  But, I never didn't do anything she asked.  Ever.  I wasn't allowed to question her, so, I just complied.  I didn't mind, except like anyone,  I can get emotional,  and at times had trouble not asking questions. Her love was worth it. 
  We used to sit and talk all night.  About anything and everything.   We would sit on the porch,  and talk from sundown to sunup.  She became part of me.  Part of my every thought.   We had everything in common.   Most people thought she was my wife. When we were physically together,  the world was good.    She was going to be my only support in losing my kids.
  Now, I sit here, having given up everything for her, and she will never probably speak to me again.  I love her.  I wasn't depressed when she was around.   I have no friends.   I have no outlets that don't make me think of her.  I have nothing.   I never got to tell her, because I wanted to protect her.  My depression has drove me back to drinking.   I can't afford therapy.   I don't have anyone in the world who cares.  
   If anyone actually read this.  I'm the type that ""everything will work out"" is just empty words.  Fate I believe meant for me to be with her.  I no longer know what to do,  or how to continue. 
  All doors are closed.  I can't seem to find an open door anywhere.  I'm broken.   I'm worthless.   I'm having trouble finding reasons to not end it.  I wasn't supposed to survive being born anyways.   My life insurance would help set the kids for life.  She was everything to me.  After a lifetime of being made fun of, people hurting me, she broke through and made me feel human.  Now, this is gone.  No explanation,  on a text.  I must be worthless to throw away that easy.
  
  This is just more details.    Adding on as I go.  Maybe someone can help me.   Or, maybe my story will make someone else feel better about their situation.   Either way,  I'm laying it all out there.    

  The job.
 
    I explained earlier that k also suffered from depression.   She did the cutting thing.  I won't say I don't understand as over the last few months,  I have considered it.  We spent a lot of time discussing our depression.   Going over the ups and downs.   She had been mistreated by family and the men in her life.  I made her a promise to not be on that list. 
  When we worked at the same place, we made one hell of a team.  She always had the best evaluations.  Right up until our new auditor made a mistake,  took it to our new boss, who was prone to jumping the gun before understanding the situation.   So she was let go.  This crushed her confidence.   While I was able to later research and show it was an error on their part, it was too little too late. 
  Then she had a period of unemployment,  being turned down for various positions.   As I watched her fall apart,  all I could do was comfort her.  Always reminding her how awesome she was.   Though,  she quickly became numb to me telling her so.  Then she took a position as a security guard just to pay the bills.   Totally underemployed.   All I again could do was try to remain positive for her.  Reminding her how amazing she was.  However,  she started to reach the point where she felt like it was the best she could do.  Knowing she can run circles around most everyone in almost any type of analytical work, it was not easy to watch.
   A few months later,  I was let go for much the same reason.   I got lucky and found a good position in production logistics analytics.   While she was happy for me, well, you know.  
  Then she called me up telling me she was done with her current job due to b.s. she was dealing with.   Then she was fine with it.  Then she was done again.   I didn't know whether to push or what.   Push too much,  she would get angry.  Don't push,  I'm not helping.   She means the world to me.   Not an easy spot to be in.
   Honestly,  she's better than me at everything.  So, after I had been here for a while,  I just happened to report to a plant manager.   While I'm on good terms with the other plant manager.   I'm also good at my job.  So when I told them I knew someone better,  they were very interested.  However,  she doesn't think she interviews well.  So, I worked out something awesome with my plant managers.   They would help her resume, then give her a ""mock"" interview  to help her out.  Let's just say , the job paid much better,  and it was hers.  This was part of what I was working on that I never got to tell her was set up.  She would have started today on January 3rd.  
  I work for great people,  so while it's a fast paced job due to ""just in time "" production.   So the job especially since its a larger corporation really a diamond in the rough.   Not to mention,  you literally decide your hours based on your responsibilities.   Making things like doctor visits easy.  With full benefits from day one. 
  This was huge since when support for my kids kicked in,  I wanted us to be able to support ourselves without having to scrape by.  Also, allowing us to do things for her kids and mine.

  Anxiety. 
  When we started school,  she had major anxiety issues with being in a small room with a bunch of people.  So, I had to work hard to make her focus on me, and not the room.   My issue is the same yet different,  as I have trouble with moving masses.  Like the mall is overwhelming to me with tons of people going all different directions.   She was the only one who ever helped through things like this.  Keeping me focused on her.  
  My other issues are more like just missing her.  In ten years,  we hadn't ever been not around each other for a full week.   She was my .....Center.  when she was around,  my back pain stopped,  and I could relax.  She was amazing. 
  
  The move out
  The night she moved out was a messy night.   The wife had been pushing her to find someone else.   So, she started talking with a guy several states away.   K was very...inebriated.   My daughter  admittedly rudely, read some stuff over her shoulder.   
 She yelled at her and went downstairs.   I was told something was up.  When I asked, all she yelled out the door was for her kids to get in the car.   So, I busted the door open to stop this.  I was not going to let her drive, especially with the kids in the car while wasted.   I argued with her to call her mom.   When I went to stop her, she went off (I don't blame her, the wife made the situation unbearable) and started hitting me.   So, I grabbed her and held her through biting me enough to leave a mark for years.   I let her up when she agreed to call for a ride.   I was probably wrong here, but, I was worried about people I loves safety. 
  Her memory of the night is completely different,  as I held her against her will.  She just wanted to wait in the car for her mom whom she said she had already texted.   She didn't tell me at the time, nor did her mom when I called her.  But, I guess I was wrong?
  This was the only physical encounter.   To be honest,  I was amazed at myself.   I think I would have lost it with anyone else in this world.  This by the way,  made me realize how much I love her.
  
    The ex

  I don't know why, but I would get jealous when she would talk to her ex.   He's half a world away.  So I get I'm being dumb.   But, it was still painful to me.   She didn't understand why, I couldn't explain,  so it was a running issue.  While he was not husband material,  she did want to be friends with him.  Have to admit,  I can't be all wrong here, since she found it so easy to get rid of me.

  No one will probably read this much.   But, I want to get everything out there.  Again,  there is more, but, I'm having trouble typing this because my anxiety has me shaking.   I wish I could erase her from my memory.   I just don't know how.   
  
  The bubble.
   She has a personal bubble that she lets very few people in to.  I get this as I have it too.  If you see her in general, she would prefer you just pretend she didn't exist.    I also usually feel the same here.  Our bubbles,  oddly seemed attracted to each other.   We could both deal with someone when we were together.   Split us up, and it was right back to square one. 

  The breakdown 
  At one point,  I had reached my breaking point.   Now,  I'm used to back pain from anxiety.   It's become part of my life.   There however was a time I just completely snapped.   I don't remember much but crying.   Expect that at one point,  and Angel showed up and took me in her arms.  The pain stopped.   Problems stopped.  The world was a new place.   When I realized it was k,  I knew at that moment,  all movies and stuff aside,  she was the one.  The you wait a lifetime for.   The one who is that other half of everything wrong with you. 
  She also had a moment like this,  and wrote me a letter expressing fate, and that I was hers forever.   I agreed and she had me promise to stick by this.  I did, and I will say I have never broke a promise to her.
  
  Now for tryingto email her, she has labeled me a stalker.   While I would never invade her personal space without invitation.   So crazy, she went from ""I love you"" to ""I'm blocking you ""   no explanation.   No quarter given.  I'm just supposed to walk away.  Like nothing mattered.   Like naming my daughter after her, always being that and dropping everything for her didn't matter.   I question.   What's the point of trying anything anymore.

I know school is important but I'm disencouraged to pursue it. I can't seem to do anything normal teens do like going out, clubbing or partying or even casual picnics. For as long as I have lived I've never really done something with friends.. At first, it was because of family problems I ended up hating wanting money or needing it so I created a lifestyle for myself in which I don't use money or ask my parents for it. My life has always been sitting behind a screen watching people enjoy life and thinking to myself that once I get a bit older the family problems would be gone and the coast would be clear but I was dead wrong.
Now I'm 18, a loser no lifer, worthless, socially unwanted and ugly and the reason I say ugly is because I truely consider myself ugly.. I reckon the last time I actually bought new clothes was in the summer like january 2016.. I have been thinking a lot and maybe this is my life and I should accept that.. I can't really see a way out of the situation I'm in because weither its now or in the future, I will have to be in situations where the same family problems still present themselves..

They know that majority of the time I'll refuse to hang out so they just hang out without me most of the time. It's strange but it still feels really shitty like it's some sort of betrayal.

I met this girl over the new years, we were talking and talking, her friend said we looked like a cute couple and gave me signs that this girl likes me. I felt as happy as anyone could be, we started hanging out almost every day, I feel so happy seeing her, hugging her, when she looks and smiles at me I felt like this was the best thing that has ever happened to me. But this faded. After a week of hanging out I noticed that me didn't talk as much as we would, that she wasn't smiling at me anymore, I wish I could tell her my feelings for her. This was the girl I could spend the rest of my life with. I am a complete fucking loser, I want to ask her out but I can't, rejection is an every day fear of mine, I love this girl so much, and this feeling will never end.

I know breaking up was a good thing because he was very controlling and only cared for himself, but I'm still so sad. He was the only person in my life that told me he loved me. When I was alone and broken he fixed me. Now I have nothing..",4,broke up
"I'm not insinuating suicide here, in any way, though I have had the thought. 

I'm stuck with controlling parents. Not to mention they are completely in denial about this subject. I don't trust them with ANY problems I have, big or small. I have never even been able to walk up to them and say ""hey I'm feeling down"" without it turning into a massive sprawl for outside help I don't want. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't want their help. It's not that I don't care about them, I just like talking to my friends a lot more. 

However, with parents such as these, they're constantly not allowing me to have the friends I want, do what I want, or make my own mistakes. 

They're keeping me trapped in an endless cycle of stress and sadness. My grades have failed because I simply can't keep up with my severe depression. But they don't get that. To them, I'm ""not trying hard enough."" And can I go to someone to vent, who I actually know and trust? No. They're a bad influence, weed smoker, etc. 

Not that I have a friend to run to, anyways. I mean, the only two people I even talk to are based solely on my comedic factor and emotional support(by that I support them) and so to them it seems like nothing is wrong with me. 

I want to be in a relationship, I do, but even at the age of 16 I've never had a girlfriend(serious, at least) and all my recent attempts have been met with rejection and then failed friendship. 

So I just don't know where to go. I can't keep up with grades, have no one to talk to, have given up on family, love, fashion, hobbies, school. Where am I to even go?

Not to top the traumatic shit that has happened to me. I have never told anyone, even complete strangers what has happened to me, because I don't trust anyone. 

Depression has made me way too critical of people's ulterior motives, so trust for me is an issue. Those two friends I trust wouldn't listen to me if I had a problem anyway. 

Not to mention my parents keep trying to send me to therapists and the like, even though I can't tell them what I've done, for fear of getting shamed/disowned/arrested etc., and even though I've told them this they don't care. They're trying to shove help down my throat, but with good intention. 

So, all in all, my life is in shambles right now. I just don't know where to run. Maybe someone will read this whole thing and listen and relate, but I doubt it. 

Sorry if this is jumping around. I can't organize my thoughts properly right now. I'm sorry. ",4,"struck with controlling parenst, dont trust them, not allowing me to have friends, keep trapped in endless cycle of stress and sadness, grades have failed, no friends to turn away to"
"For the past few months I've been going through a tough period of depression, but a month ago everything changed. Warning: long.

For the past year my parents have been fighting constantly. Their fights slowly grew in number and severity at the beginning of 2016, peaking in the summer and falling afterwards. January-May, June-August, August-December.

At the beginning I tried hard to not let it affect me, I genuinely believed I was fine, and that the fighting would pass. After all, my parents have always had a rocky history. Unfortunately the fights only grew, and I began fighting my mom. My mom invested a large amount of time into alternative healing, something I am strongly against. I hated it, I still hate it, I still get angry at my mom for falling into these traps. I want her to realize that her problem has nothing to do with toxins, imbalances, alkaline levels or mindfulness, the problem is her. Her as a whole.

I tried arguing this for months, to no avail. Overtime I guess it all got to me. The constant stress, the hatred towards my own home.

The mental problems first began at the beginning of the year. During this time I had constant racing thoughts, I was unable to maintain a clear head. I also felt extremely anxious at this time. Little things would cause me to become extremely anxious, such as being out and about with my own family. I was always afraid someone was watching my every move, even at home. I guess this counts as paranoia too. This affected me physically too, I was uneasy, my stomach hurt quite often. I was exhausted easily.

These feelings slowly disappeared, replaced with new ones in the summer. At the beginning of the summer, around June, I created a list of things I wanted to learn over the summer. I wanted to be productive over the summer. I never completed a single task on that list. Over summer I simply failed to complete anything. I would start projects, and never complete them. Iâm not sure if it has anything to do with procrastination or depression. I wasnât necessarily sad, I simply failed to function. I would like to note that the fights both with my mom and between my mom and dad were at their worst during this time.

Fall and winter were the worst. I slowly became more and more depressed as the realization that my parents were officially going to divorce. My inability to function fully carried over. I would come home, fail to do my homework, or any work for the record. Even sitting at my desk and wasting time became exhausting. My parents fights decreased in number and in severity, but they affected me more than ever. I âblew upâ often during the summer, exploding in anger, but around this time I couldnât feel anything but sadness and hopelessness. I was too tired and too depressed to care. Not just about my parentâs situation, but about school, about life. There were some rare times in which I had suicidal thoughts. I hardly cried, but I was completely broken on the inside.
(READ LIST)

-------------------

*Ups:*

**High energy**

* Shaky

* Hard to stay still

* Lack of need for sleep

* Pacing

Example: Once on a trip to Malaysia, my family was eating dinner, I wasnât. It was around 8:00PM that day and all I had was a red bean bun, one cucumber sushi roll and lots of water throughout the day. That night I felt so energetic that I had to get up out of my seat and walk around the restaurant in order to calm myself down. I was unable to calm myself down substantially, and was still highly energetic but I was a bit calmer.

**Paranoia**

* Loss of trust in others, even close family members and friends

* Believing others to be plotting against me in some form

* (Mixed with delusions) Thoughts of monsters trying to hunt me down

* Thoughts of people trying to kill me

* Government surveillance

* Loss of trust in those close to me

Example: On the way to the airport in December my mother, sister, grandparents and aunts split up in different taxis. My mother received a ride from her married friend. (This friend also has children.) My mom came a bit later than us, as she got lost. However I strangely acted out in paranoia, accusing her of having an affair with the man, accusing her of cheating on my dad. I lashed out, and raised my voice in the middle of the airport.

**Strong, Sudden in Self Confidence**

* Arrogance

* Godlike feelings and delusions

Example: Once when I was feeling up I texted my friend the following(each line represents a new text, this is unedited):

&gt;I feel another late night coming up

&gt;See nobody understands

&gt;But you fo

&gt;Do

&gt;I'm a fucking genius

&gt;You know I was watching this show

&gt;This guy

&gt;He says

&gt;""I always ask myself if I'm the most powerful man in the room, and I generally always am. That's what drove me for years.""

&gt;Great great quote

&gt;And I'm reading this book

&gt;On prioritizing what's important

&gt;There's so much for me to clear out

&gt;Tonight I'm hammering out that surveillance essay

&gt;My paranoia's also back

&gt;You know when I get home there's so much for me to do
	
&gt;I'm so fucking amazing

&gt;There's so mich

&gt;I'm only here for 100 years tops

&gt;I better be fucking remembered in 300

&gt;I'm going to meet Snowden

&gt;I'm going to get essay published

**Feeling out of touch with reality**

This one requires a longer explanation, when I feel this itâs as if my life is a movie, and Iâm watching it. I see everything I do and though I may regret it immediately afterwards, I canât stop myself. Itâs a strong feeling and loss of self control.

**Increased agitation**

Once again a feeling that requires an explanation. I get really easily angry during this state, and tend to lash out at people, even yelling at them. 

**Strange delusions**

This one also requires an explanation. One constant delusion is the idea that my life is specifically a greek tragedy. In a way this ties in with my self confidence boost, as I tend to feel like I am extremely important and a guaranteed powerful, historical character.

**Racing thoughts**

**Anxiety**

* Sick stomach feelings

* Shaky self

* Feeling of âbombardmentâ mentally

**Work motivation**

* Feel the need to do a ton of work

**Increased mistakes**

As was shown in the message transcript, I made several spelling errors, and in texts thatâs something I rarely do. For the past year or so Iâve refrained from making spelling errors and using standard text acronyms. Making mistakes in texts and emails is a rarity for me. I also tend to misread things.

Example: One Monday my dad reminded me to take our water bottles outside for a refill on Tuesday, the next day. He texted me this reminder. I immediately misread the text and assumed he wanted me to take the water bottles out that day, which made no sense to me as the bottles are collected on Wednesday mornings. I ended up engaging in an argument with him on this through text, freaking out and getting extremely angry with him. Only later did I realize the mistake I had made. Mistakes like this have been made several times.

**Memory problems**

* Tend to forget things more

**Feeling disconnected from self**

I really need to write this one out. Iâve been looking at old pictures and videos of myself, and while I know itâs me, I donât feel like itâs me. I feel as if Iâm losing myself. I donât really know how to put it, but I just feel like Iâm not myself. I know my name is OneAnonDepressed but I donât feel like Iâm me. 

**Loss of hunger and appetite**

**Lack of sleep, but still energetic**

* This has led to several bad experiences, one detailed below.

**Strong, strange, dangerous urges**

* Urge to jump off of high places, but not suicidal

* Urge to throw my phone down in anger, happiness while laughing for no reason

* Urge to punch things randomly, but for fun, not out of anger

**Increased creativity**

====================

How this has impacted my life:

Iâve been more sociable, more likable in a sense. Iâve also been lashing out at people more, which is a negative. Iâve lost sleep and become unhealthier at the same time. I also tend to act on impulse, which has affected my social life both negatively and positively.

One time, on December 30th beginning in the early morning, a really scary and strange incident occurred. My dad called at around 1am asking when I was going to sleep and to be quiet. I could hardly speak, what came out was a garbled unintelligible mess. I spent about two hours listening to music and feeling ""high""(my sort of strange high). Then this intense paranoia kicks in and I'm afraid to close my eyes, I brought out my knife, prepared to stab something, some sort of monster I was convinced was in my room. Then I locked myself in my bathroom. I spent nine minutes in there but it felt like an hour.Eventually I run out of the bathroom to eat part of a cold burrito, which I was obsessed with doing despite still being paranoid about the imaginary monster. My mom sees me, I ignore her and run back upstairs to lock myself in the bathroom. My dad comes upstairs banging on the door as I was far too loud. I then start yelling and run downstairs trying to clean things for some reason. I eventually freak out downstairs, pacing and knocking down chairs. Then I start crying like crazy and my mind is racing and I'm screaming. Then I calmed down, it was 5am. I went to sleep, and didn't wake up until 8pm. The scariest part was that everything I did and felt was involuntary, and a part of me was rational and questioning myself, but that was overpowered. This is one clear example of these ups negatively affecting my life.

Iâve lost control and have developed a bad temper as well. Outbursts occur often, I canât control them. Once in an argument with my mom Iâve said some things I regret.

====================

Duration:

Generally lasts from a few hours to multiple days. Minimum of three hours and maximum of three weeks(ash?). First began in early December after a month of depression, continued for three weeks with a few hours of depression at random days in between.

-------------------

Downs:

**Apathy**

* Loss of interest in activities

* Lack of motivation to do anything, really

**Fatigue**

* Even after getting plenty of sleep

**Increased hunger and appetite**

* Eating for the sake of eating, intense hunger

**General feelings of hopelessness**

* Feeling like things donât matter, like nothing matters

**Suicidal thoughts**

* Self explanatory, wanting to die

**Hatred for self**

* Hating myself due to my inability to work well, constant cycle, falling deeper into well

**Loss of energy**

Most days I didnât want to get out of bed, and hardly anything motivated me to do so. The thought of failing school was all that kept me going, but it only kept me from failing, not succeeding.
Feelings and hope for nonexistence

Not exactly suicidal, but some days I didnât want to exist in the first place. 

====================

How this has impacted my life:

Throughout the month of November I was depressed. The problem with this is it led to a downfall at school. As soon as I got home it was insanely difficult to push myself to do any work, and I mostly just ended up doing nothing for a few hours until I ate dinner and fell asleep, repeating the cycle again the next day. Because of this, in English I wasnât keeping up with the weekly vocabulary work and reading a book we were supposed to read. When finals came around in early December I was unprepared, having only read around 10% of the book and studying 40% of the words. (Each week we received a new set of words and I stopped studying words as soon as the new ones came in. This ultimately led to me doing poorly on my English final. In my Japanese class I also slacked off, not completing work and so my teacher informed me that I would take the final when I returned after winter break. I also stopped talking with my parents, communication fell and I didnât really want to see anybody.

====================

Duration:

Generally lasts from a few hours to a few days. Minimum of one hour and maximum of one month. First began in November, long period ended at the end of November and occurred randomly in December.

-------------------

Mix:

Twice this has happened. The two feelings above have collided twice. Once, on December 8. Below is an exact, unedited copy of what I wrote down that night at around 10PM, I ended up forcing myself to go downstairs and ask my dad to walk with me around the neighborhood, as I felt horrible.

&gt;December 8

&gt;December 8

 &gt;I am not okay


&gt;Combining the two things I felt these past few months

&gt;The depression and the mild insanity

&gt;Iâm filled with high energy but I want to calm down but I canât and my mind is racing and I feel like screaming but I wonât

&gt;I swear Iâm at war with myself right now

&gt;Iâm isolating myself before I do something I will regret

&gt;Iâve already slipped multiple times, filter for speech gone.

&gt;I want to break stuff out of anger but Iâm laughing and happy and crying inside

&gt;Iâm not okay

&gt;Iâm bouncing back and forth and I hate it

&gt;I want to do so much but Iâm hollow

&gt;A THOUSAND EMOTIONS AT ONCE

&gt;HELP

&gt;NOTHING HELPS 		

&gt;I m isolating myself from my family for tonight I canât go downstairs Iâm too unstable

The other time this happened I failed to record anything.

--------------------

To Conclude:

Iâm not the kind to self diagnose myself, I donât overreact when it comes to medical problems, and most of the time I brush things off. But lately Iâve been searching around and researching what Iâm feeling. I came across a few interviews of Stephen Fry, where he describes mental illnesses, specifically bipolar disorder, and it explains exactly what Iâm feeling. I looked more into bipolar disorder and what people describe fits everything Iâm feeling.

My mother told me that these feelings are normal during hard times, such as divorces. But I donât think so, this just doesnât feel right, even in my condition. Iâve already gone through what I would consider to be normal emotions during hard times.

My father told me that Iâm fine, and it was just a clash of puberty and the hard times at home. I seriously doubt it. Iâve experienced teenage hormones, and even though some parts of that match what I feel when Iâm up, including mood swings, itâs all very mild by comparison. After confessing to having had suicidal thoughts my dad has been working on scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist.

If anyone wants clarification or has questions on anything please ask.

If anyone has had similar experiences and would like to share please do, I really am scared and am in desperate need of answers.",4," parents fight a lot, mother went for alternative therapy, mother is the problems, impacted negatively, mental health issues, depression, anxiety panic, mmod swings suicidal thoughts"
"A bit of background. There's this guy who I used to be great friends with in high school. Now we go to same college and we still have some of the same friends, but he's no longer in our main group of friends. 

I still talk to him from time to time, but we're not the ""talk everyday"" type of friends.

I was bored on Reddit recently so I decided to check his profile because he posts his own music and some stupid (in a good way) jokes sometimes, and I wanted to check it out.

I found his post here from a few weeks ago and I realized he broke up with his girlfriend, flunked a few classes, feels like he doesn't have anyone to talk to, and is really depressed h.

He didn't show up to a party we threw some time ago but we assumed that it was because of his grades. Now we found out he's going through issues.

We resolved to invite him to more stuff and reach out to him. We're also putting together a ""grades rehab crew"" to help tutor him next semester. What else can we do to help him through this?

For example, is it wise to ask people we know in his college block about the situation?

Do we tell him we saw his post?

I really wanna help my friend out. We would really appreciate your advice, reddit.

Here's his post for some more info.

"A good while ago back in college, there was a guy who joined our friends group. Me and him had a lot in common, and while a number of us found him to be annoying, I stuck up for the guy. I told him about my past - my first love was a long distance relationship and when i went to visit her, it turned out to be nothing more than a huge joke on her end and that gave me trust issues.

Time moves on, we end up becoming roommates with another mutual friend. Eventually, introduced into my life is this other girl.  She's a bit of a depressed wreck, and given my past, her being into me as much as she was, made me a bit hesitant to label the relationship.  We slept together a number of times, and eventually my friend found out, much to my dislike.  They got along a bit TOO well for my liking, to the point where i told him that if he ever slept with her, it would end our friendship.

A couple weeks ago, i saw her leave his room and our apartment ever so casually without making eye contact with me. Knowing immediately what was up, I questioned him about it.  I went into his room, saw the condom, and what really, REALLY hammered in the betrayal, the breach of trust wasn't anything they did.  It wasn't the fact that something was important to me that he knew about and selectively ignored. 

It was the lying.

He's been tossed out of the apartment since, but he is coming back once winter break is over. But in this process, i'm done.
Earlier, i was an apathetical cynical wreck who no one cared about, but now I can't bring myself to trust anyone, even the other roommate.  My friend was the more outgoing of us, so of course he has more friends, but I can't involve myself with any of them, much less anyone else because I can't...trust them.  In one fell swoop, it feels like he's taken everything from me. 

I don't care for my job anymore. It's means to an end, and that end is a pretty pathetic life. I'm at the point where i'm done with everything, because as far as i'm concerned, I don't see anything positive anymore.

"Hey Folks,

I feel that I really need a place to vent. This past September I was accepted into a program I've always dreamed of being in which was a great win for me. Unfortunately, it turned out to be bitter sweet because my grandmother passed away after a long battle with cancer shortly after starting. It really tore me up because I had to move away in August and didn't ever call her before she passed. I guess always felt I had something higher up on the list before calling her and might have been scared to call her too so just avoided it. The next time I saw her in person she was on a ventilator and heavily sedated, a shadow of her former self. 

The next months I kept busy with school which kept me from dealing with this event properly. Things just got worse from there though as one of my aunts was found dead in her house (heart attack) and another underwent surgery and ended up in the ICU. I feel I buried myself in school, shutting myself out from my emotions and told myself I would work through everything when I got home for Christmas break. The first day home, however, my mom got a call saying that the aunt who had surgery took a drastic turn for the worse and was on her death bed. This takes me up to now. This aunt who meant the world to me died and I just have lost all energy to function and have shut down. I'm scared to go back to school with all of this stuff still unresolved and I just want to feel appropriately for all of these losses. I've had a few complete breakdowns this last week but the grief hangs over me still. 

I think this is a first step to dealing with these issues but I'd really appreciate anyone else's perspectives. 

Thank you",4,"grandmother passed away, one aunt died due to heartattack, another due to surgary comlications, , had breakdowns, unresolved, grief hangs over"
"Backstory: I'm 21. My dad just turned 73. I have the typical father / daughter relationship every girl wishes to have. I was spoiled growing up. Yes, he's old. Yes, I was an accident. Yes, my parents are still together. Let's continue. 

Last year was big for me. Was promoted as the youngest employee company wide to have my position. I moved out. Travelled a LOT. Last year I also learned my dad's cancer had spread and it was a lot more serious this time. I was on my own, living my own life, for 6 months. I realized how bad things had gotten, and I broke my lease and moved back home to help assist my parents with things around the house. In May, he stopped treatment. He was given 6-9 months. We are now at the 9 month mark and he's on his way to a hospital bed in our living room. Meanwhile, my mom is a chainsmoker who is  coming down with pneumonia. 

Back to the point. My father is old, and has lived a very good life. I cannot be angry that his time has come. What I am angry about, however, is the fact I am now lost. Here comes my thought process.

Watching my mother take care of my dad in ways I would have never thought possible, how will she handle this when her husband is no longer on this earth?

He will without a doubt pass in my childhood home. When is the appropriate time to move out again? Will my mom be okay to take care of herself? 

I'm taking a lot of time off of work, and my boss is okay with it under the given circumstances. What if I'm not ready to return?

My mom lost her mother during the summer of 2015. Now she's losing her husband Spring of 2017, if he makes it that far. As far as family goes, it's just me and my brother, who has a family of his own. 

She's the type of mom who will spend hundreds of dollars on presents if it means not having to keep in touch daily / be a babysitter etc.. Not because she dislikes us, but because she has always been an independent, introverted.. er, bitch. When she does connect with you, it is something to be adored. She has a very unique way of showing love and it's the only love I have ever known from her. 

I keep having to remind myself that I am 21 and have my whole life ahead of me, but is that selfish? I'm not looking to abandon her after this is all said and done, but I ~feel~ like I need to return to my life as soon as possible. It's taking a toll on me mentally, and as a result, I'm isolating myself from friends and social gatherings. I just have no desire to do those things anymore. Some days its hard to get out of bed because I can't do anything. It's not that I don't WANT to get up start my day, I just lay there and think, ""whats the point? I don't need plans."" That's new. My parents are in the other room together 90% of the time, while I spend my entire day in my room trying to find things to distract me from my current life. I don't like thinking about the future because I feel exhausted trying to make those thoughts seem realistic. I'm either very irritable or so quiet that I don't think I can talk. The thought of going back to work to make money to resume the life I had seems unpalatable. 

I guess what I'm saying is, I'm stuck in a very large rut and I don't know what direction to go in, I just know that I need to get out of it.

TLDR: My dad is dying of natural causes, I put my life on pause to spend time with him, I realized that my mom might not do too well alone, and I don't know how / when / if I will go back to my life before I moved home or how I want to resume my life to move on.",4,"21 years old, parents very old, good job, promoted as youngets employee, travelled a lot , father diagnosed with cance, hospitalized, treatment stopped, 6-9 months given, worried about mother,mom a chain smoker, coing down with pneumonia, in a rut,"

"I've been going out with her for a little bit. She's told me she loves me a lot, but the past couple months i've made her feel unwanted. After she told me this and basically hinted that she wants this to be over, I realized that I have some deep rooted issues. I'm not happy (with myself), I haven't been happy for over a decade. I've faked it for so long, but I just hid all my unhappiness and now it's starting to come to me. I haven't wanted to wake up, I don't want to kill myself, but I don't care to live. Being alive just feels like my punishment for being a bad person. 

Here's this beautiful and great girl who loves me, and I've pushed her to the side and made her feel unwanted. Just so I can spend time by myself, alone, with my thoughts, because that should be how I feel. Alone and awful. And I hurt her in the process. She may be over me soon....but I won't be over her for a long time. And I need to let her go, I need to let her out of my toxic orbit. It hurts to know I've lost one of my best friends, but it's the only way I know how to get over someone. She deserves better than me anyway.

"This post is a mess. I don't care about structuring; I just typed in the words as they came to me... sorry for the mess...

---

I've been thinking about this for a while... then again, I stay in bed or sleep through most of the days, so I have a lot of time to think.

I talked to one of my friends (an increasingly rare species) last night and it got me to think.

I can't help anyone. As much as they keep saying things like how kind I am to them (""dude... if you really just said that, then you're not paying attention"") how good I am at listening, how much I helped (with what?)... nobody comes to me anymore when things happen. Unless I ask first, but by that time the damage is already done or they are already out of it.

So this friend and I talked and we talked for hours. Things got emotional at some points and eventually I just said ""Thank you for trusting me, but please, for your own sake, don't... you may come to me for help one day, on a day when I'm sick of being alive, and I will hurt you. I will makes things worse for you.""
Did I just say that? Really? Damn you, Bluerain12ya, what the hell are you doing?!?!

It hurt me. I'm on the verge of crying as I'm typing this and I don't know anymore what I'm supposed to do. Why am I even here? Why am I alive?

My mum recently told me about her depression which I knew nothing about. I didn't know how to react...
My crush was hospitalised due to a failed suicide attempt and despite how much we talked and helped each other in the past, she went to that other friend I talked to last night. I didn't even have the chance to help her. People who know about my depression, my medication, my self harm stopped talking to me. Sure we talk when I meet them, or if I message first, but for them to come to me first?
Hell, they are probably right. I'd just let them down anyway...

The only person I do talk on a semi-daily basis is someone I've met on r/selfharmpics
I have my doubts if I should message her any more, or rather if she should come to me and trust me with her problems. Every time I say something positive, every time I try to help, I feel like the biggest damn hypocrite on the planet. But I'm mostly worried that, especially recently, I just put my worthlessness for her to deal with, my constant whining, and I end up hurting her more than the suffering she already has to deal with. But I promised her, that I will not leave, I won't push her away and I won't let her push me away. That I might keep my distance if she needs it, but I will always be close enough to reach me. But I'm terrified that I'm just making things worse!!!

And I tried. I though if I try to help others, maybe I can take my mind off of things, and if they feel better, than I feel better, too. But I can't. And nobody wants to come to me. Nobody should come to me, anyway, since now I realise that I'll just be worthless... I'll just end up hurting them even more.

"It's been 6 months now. some days, she crosses my mind and I hate her with fiery rage and passion! Then some days, I don't think about her at all.....but then there are some days, where as much as I hate her...I still miss her like crazy.

I miss being able to end my night  with your voice. I miss the way my heart would light up when you spoke. I miss the way you burn with passion about the things you love. I miss you. I just miss all of you.

"Does anyone else struggle around this time of year? I find myself fluctuating massively from being optimistic and determined to make positive changes, to feeling totally hopeless and unmotivated to do anything. 

I was dumped out of the blue in the beginning of November, and whilst it took it's toll on me at the time I felt like I could push through. By December I really was ok. But now the new year has come around and i've gone back to the usual routine of work, eat, sleep, repeat, I feel more lonely, useless and unlovable than ever before, convincing myself that 2017 is going to be awful. I wish there was a way I could just permanently stay in the positive moments where everything seems to have purpose and promise, but it seems as soon as I start feeling ok, I tumble backwards and feel worse than ever again :(

"She saw it in her mind's eye like a movie playing, the haunting memories from her childhood she couldn't seem to shake blending together into one raw, aching image. Her mother lying in a darkened room for days, her face swollen with tears. The inevitable ashtray overrun with ashes, the acrid scent of pot smoke in the air. The bed or couch or futon may have been different from year to year as Evie moved them around from apartment to commune to funky cottage, but her mother was always the same. Falling hard for some man, immersing herself in romantic fantasies that were crushed when the guy left. And the guy always left. Her mother's inability to get a grasp on reality had too often left Mischa to care for her younger sister, to care for her mother, from too young an age. She remembered shaking Evie awake, trying to get her to eat. To get up and take a shower, take her and Raine to school. No kid should have to do that.

"I have beaten depression before! I really have! But this time for the life of me I can't! 

I have so much going on. Too much. A lot of heavy burdens but I also have lots of good too. My dad is living in the hospital. My mom had angina. My dad is a VERY COMPLICATED case. My mom's attitude is ""whatever"". And I have two older brothers, one who can't help through no fault of his own he has heart problems.

"Somebody I care very much for has been on escitalopram for years due to crippling depression.

Now, for the past week and a half, he's been feeling very emotional and out of control and the past 3 or 4 days he just can't stop crying, even at work. Every little thing upsets him to the point of tears and when he talks, he almost sounds like he's drunk. Of course, him being so emotional, he won't go to the doctor because he feels like it would be wasting the doctor's time.

"On Christmas night my boyfriend of two years broke up with me over text message. I didn't quite figure out what he was saying until the next morning.

We had gotten into an argument because he felt that I wasn't paying attention to him. I disagree. I was paying attention to him. Of course my six year old sister was going to act more excited to see him than a I do on an average day. He's a novelty to her. She thinks he's awesome. She loves when people just exist. She's six. And I made an error with the time that I went to his house, so we only got an hour and a half rather than the two hours I planned for. When we got to my house, he didn't make any effort to do Christmas dinner stuff with me or talk to me. And then he was mad at me for not spending that hour with him when he didn't try spending the hour with me. I tried. I tried to make everything fucking perfect. I was nervous. His family does Christmas differently. This was my chance to show him my traditions and we'd mix our traditions together in our future. I felt like we didn't get to be together much, so I invited him to help my sister try out her telescope. Apparently he didn't want to, but there was no communication. He didn't say anything. I sent my sister inside when we couldn't figure out how to use the telescope. He wouldn't come inside. He quiet-whisper-yelled ""no"" when I asked if he wanted to go inside. He told me that he never wanted to go outside. That I had been ignoring him all day/night. I don't remember everything that I said, but after he accusingly told me that my sister seemed more excited to see me then I have in a long time, I got angry. I told him that he could either come inside or stay outside. His choice.

When I came back outside after composing myself a bit, he was gone. The gift from my parents were sitting on the front steps and he was gone. I was terrified. I am terrified of people just leaving and disappearing without a trace. And he did just that. I texted him to ask where he was while trying to quell the rising panic. He could get hit by a car or get sick from the cold or just completely vanish forever. He replied that he was a good distance down the road. I panicked for a moment while formulating a plan. I went inside and grabbed my keys. I was going to tell my parents and grandparents that I'd be back, but they seemed so happy. I could totally handle this on my own while everything was falling apart.

I drove to the intersection and pulled into an empty parking lot nearby and got out. He was across the street and I wouldn't be able to safely cross right away, so I screamed his name. I'm not really the kind of person to scream, but I was angry and hurt and still panicking. I don't remember everything I said on the drive to his house. I did tell him that no matter how angry I was in previous arguments that I have never and would never just walk away like that. I told him that I wanted to in one, but I purposely left my purse and maybe my shoes so that I couldn't make a rash decision out of anger.

When we parted, he said, ""Over next few days, you should think about whether we should keep fighting for us or not,"" which I responded to with, ""Are you going to?"" I guess I heard it in a condescending way or something. He said of course. He said ""I still love you"" and I told him the same. Then he went into his house and I left and went home absolutely destroyed. I cried a tiny bit, but it wasn't hitting me. Then I got home and saw that my grandparents had just left and I was just devastated. When I came inside I cried into my stepmom's lap for like, ever. When I looked at my phone to say goodnight and send my love, I saw the following...

""I'm sorry the night had to end that way.""

""We're two totally different people and we don't seem to work well together. All we do is hurt each other anymore and it's getting to be draining. I need to get better and you need to get better and we spend too much time working against each other. I'm sorry. I tried. And you did, too. It's time to focus on ourselves.""

And that was sent at 9:15. I got home around 8 or 8:30. It felt like he had already decided early on. That wasn't the couple of days. It was barely an hour.

He then unfriended me and my family on Facebook. This was like, the 27th. We officially broke up on the 26th, I guess.

I don't know if I forgive him. I don't think that I do. I feel like he put the entire night being fucked up on me. Like I should have done better. And I usually tell myself that. I usually tell myself that I should have done this or that. But not this time.

I don't know how to move on or push through or whatever. I miss him and I still love him and I don't want him out of my life forever. I've never been so heartbroken. I feel empty and I am depressed. I've always gone to him. I trusted him. I'm telling myself that now he can go find someone who isn't stupid. Someone who isn't afraid of intimacy. I don't know, someone better. Maybe he wants to just forget about me with my fucked up brain and chemical imbalances and mood disorder like everyone else should. I don't know what to do and I'm really trying to just be happy but I can't. I barely got through New Year's Eve. I tried using positive images to get to sleep last night because I couldn't sleep, but all I could think of was love and how I was a fucking idiot to think that I'd ever find it. Why did I let myself feel?

There is no one to help me look after my dad because no one likes him, not even me. I can't stand the asshole. He throws his urinals at the nurses! 

My oldest brother has heart problems 

My middle brother doesn't act like he cares about family but his friends have out right called me a liar.

I can't handle life. I just can't. I try and ask for help and I get no where.

I could write a book on all that's bothering me. But it's this depression that is killing me. And when I'm feeling ""better"" I really fear that in my low moments I might actually kill myself. I live with suicidal thoughts at any given moment of the day. I can be laughing with someone then as soon as the smile fades I'm back to thinking about killing myself. Most mornings those suicidal feelings are so intense that I'm not sure what I'm going to do when I get out of bed.

"My mom who's 57 years of age has fallen into depression. A choice I made that involved who I want to spend my life with has really hit her hard (girl from different culture). For a very long time she's had her views on things and it was very hard to convince her otherwise but I'm scared that the depression this time is really getting to her and might shorten her life. This is the last thing I want. I love her to death I don't want to force her to accept any decision I make I just need help in trying to get her out of her depression. We've tried as a family to get her to go to the doctor but failed. She's always been creative and outgoing but since we talked about my decision, she's barley left the house, gained weight, and is in constant anger. I don't know what to do and to add to all of this I'm not there with her. I live away from my family and that's made it even harder. Any advice would be appreciated.

"
This summer I was very depressed after a break up and existential crisis. I ended up isolating myself in my room by not leaving often and my friend that stayed for the summer happens to be the one that loves belittling me, so they loved to see this. For some reason she is always so competitive and went out of her way to show that she had other friends and made fun of me for being in my room all the time. She was also the friend I was rooming with for the summer. I ended up failing my classes and taking the fall semester off because my depression became so bad. During the fall when I was at home I was fine, but now that im back at school all of the feelings came rushing back. I'm back at school by myself while my old friend group are probably getting together having fun somewhere. They didnt even contact me over the fall so i doubt that they care. I don't want to succumb to my depression again. I want to fit in somewhere this semester and do well. Any advice for this would be greatly appreciated.

"You promised to never leave me, literally a day before you left. You promised me you loved me no matter how much I bugged you and asked you over and over if you really did. You wanted to spend Christmas with me, yet a day later you left me. 

You promised you'd stay. You were mine and I was yours. You were always my one to talk to, my only one to talk to. The only one I could be myself around, the only one I've ever loved. For once in my life I didn't feel this horrible feeling I never wanted to come back.

I'm nothing but a distant bad memory to you, and the most you wanted from me in the end was pleasure. How fucking dare you. We haven't talked in 3 days, It's killing me inside. The most we have ever not talked in over a year.

As many letters or messages I write to you, to Reddit, or to even myself you will never want me. I will always want you, desperate for even just a message from you. I want you to miss me and love me again. It's all I will ever want.

You wanted me for so long, you fought for us, you wanted me. I'm guessing it's my fault. I wore you down, I'm so so sorry. I'm sorry to myself for making us end up like this. I love you so fucking much. You took money from me, oh well right? Too bad that money was worth more than I ever was. I will forever regret trusting you, maybe we would still be together.

I want the pain to stop. I want you to get out of my mind. I want you so badly and it's eating away at me. I will never get better. I never want another guy to love me or to care about me just to leave me like that. I never want to get hurt again like this.
I lost the only person who made me happy. I fucking hate myself, but I guess that's what you wanted. We both made mistakes but I am always the one to blame.

Please miss me.

I was broken before and now I'm shattered. 

I will never trust or love again. No one will ever get to make me feel this way again.

"For over a decade I've been suffering from this disease. Since middle school I've been telling my mother I need help and all she's ever done is dismiss me. Tell me I'm looking for attention or that I just need to snap out of it and be positive. It always made me doubt myself. To this day I question my sanity, is this real or am I just exaggerating?

It sure as hell feels real having been dumped two days ago. When my ex tells me I'll never be happy. When she tells me I make her miserable and I get in the way of my own potential happiness. She told me I ruined our relationship because I never did shit about myself and I'm a miserable asshole. She's right I guess.

I feel utterly worthless and alone.

In my senior year of high school I went through my worst and only other breakup. For almost a year she cheated on me and only told me after she felt guilty enough to do so. It completely destroyed my sense of self-worth and fucked my ability to trust anyone. That definitely had an affect on my relationship with my now recent ex. 

My dad left when I was 10. All I ever saw between him and my mother was constant fighting. That's all I ever knew growing up. My mom tells me I remind her so much of my dad. She seems to hate his guts. 

I have a great job and I'm making great money for someone my age. But because I'm not in school I'm doing nothing with my life. According to my ex I'm doing nothing to better myself because I'm content making the money that I am, I'm okay being financially comfortable instead of wanting to be filthy fucking rich. I have no debt at all and have a sizable savings and putting money towards a retirement. But I'm a lazy asshole because I'm not working towards something bigger. 

It's starting to affect my work life. I barely have a social life. I'm always down and no one wants to be around that. I try to be polite but I'm sure it comes across as disingenuous. I don't even know how to meet people or pretend to be happy enough to try. 

Please excuse my ranting.

The point is, I need to do something. I don't know what. I tried therapy before and it was awful. I can't bring myself to believe that the person sitting there with their notepad gives a fraction of a fuck about the chump feeling sorry for himself. They're just collecting a paycheck. I've always been determined to do things on my own but it's very clear I cannot. I'm doomed to a life of loneliness and emptiness. And I don't want to do this anymore. I can't.",4,"depressed, mother never paid attention, ex accuses of making her miserable, worst break up in senior year of high school, cheated on me, dad left at 10, worst feelings, lost"
"I am so lonely that its depressing me. I've been lonely for my whole life and I never really noticed it but around August of 2016 I got put in a team for a teamwork project I had for uni. There I met this girl and we started chatting. It was wonderful. We were basically inseparable. We were sending selfies and stuff and chatting all the time almost every day. We met irl(she lives in another town) and we both had loads of fun. 

This continued for some time and then something happened... She stopped chatting to me like we used to. She told me that she had some problems and stuff. We still chat but I really dont know how to describe it. Our conversations dont last as much as they used to and dont happen that often in general. I really got attached to her. And I really like her. But too shy to tell her how I really feel. 

She showed me what it feels like not be lonely and I really miss that feeling. I have almost no friends its only her and one childhood friend.

And now I am sitting alone at home. Everyday is the same thing. I sit at home in bed and sometimes go on my computer. And this repetitiveness of my life is really depressing me. I dont have a job yet. I will be at home for the rest of January.  I dont know how I can do anything productive when there is a massive hole in me. And some might say why dont I just go out and socialize. Well its not that easy for me. I am a very shy person and its tough for me to talk to somebody. I am just awkward. 

I just dont want a lonely boring life. 

I know that others have it worse. I wrote this just to share my story and hopefully feel better by doing so.

"So, my husband (25) was diagnosed with depression/anxiety and put on meds at age 11. He hardly knows life without depression. Aside from a few isolated episodes, it's been mostly under control. He's not suicidal or super moody, but he's not living life to the fullest either. He's just...there.

For the last few months, he's been unemployed, still trying to find a solid career. No degree past high school, hoping to get into bookkeeping (trying to take the learn by doing route). Luckily, we get by just fine on my income alone, but I still want him to find a career or something fulfilling to do outside of the home. 

I'd understand if there just weren't any jobs out there (but the job market is pretty good where we live), but we both know full well that he's not putting in sufficient effort to get a job in a timely manner. So at the very least I expect him to be helpful around the apartment, doing dishes, laundry, etc. Or at least try developing a routine so he can feel better (regular exercise, good diet, meditation, structure, etc.) But it's a struggle for him to even do that. He's just constantly drained.

I understand that this comes with the depression package. But I am still conflicted. I'm trying my best to be patient and non-judgmental. But I have a hard time telling if it's his own dang fault, or if it's depression that he can't help. I don't know whether to be angry or compassionate. Is there any way to tell the difference? I fear bringing this up with him too often for fear of making him feel even worse about himself.

Also, I understand that with the current state of depression medication, there is no cure, only things to make depression bearable. We're also apprehensive about changing meds too much since that can bring on a lot of emotional turmoil in the weeks it takes for the new medication to work. But how do you know or judge what is an acceptable level of functioning and what's unacceptable (and calls for a prescription change, therapy, etc)?

TLDR: At what point do you see a therapist/psychiatrist? How much depression (after meds and such) is acceptable? And how do I as his spouse strike a balance between pushing him to be better and being supportive?

I am a failure i am ugly as hell,i am being told i am fat so manny times,i have no talent,i cant even write (i can but almost no one understands),i am usually thinking about ending it with a gun but i dont even have the power to do it.I feel like I will never have a girlfriend just because of how stupid and ugly i am.I am pretty sure no one cares about me at all(my parents maybe).I dream about suicide almost every time.I just..im done
I hate myself 

My only hope is a miracle of me being perfect like everyone else and not a stupid fat guy when I grow up

Every girl i met and i try to start a relation with just says that i am fat and i ugly.i guess I could workout to get rid of my overweight (77Kg 1,80m)
But i can't get rid of my face

My grades are dropping really fast i had only 9-10 sometimes 8 but now...it makes me feel bad only thinking of them

I feel like a hug could help me(from someone who is not obligated to love me) like from a friend(boy or girl does not matter ) but everytime i try to hug a friend they say mostly ,,Ew"" (Girl) or something about my man boobs (Man)

An example would be for about 4 days ago.At the New year party were pretty much my friends,one was missing he was ill.I was all the time with a girl(also friend of mine)and she and me seem to like each other.I was having fun with her and just found out she chose the guy who was ill(my best friend since pre school).I never tough of me being with her ever since, but since that night i cant sleep anymore

"I was a loser's loser. I was 20 years old, never kissed a girl, weighed almost 270 pounds, got arrested twice, and almost flunked out of my major in school. 

The 2nd arrest was the last straw. I hit rock bottom and I was so embarrassed. In literally ONE SUMMER, I hit the gym every day, lost over 65 pounds and saw a therapist. When I got back to college, I got a 3.9 GPA the first semester back. I also figured out a way to be popular with the ladies, finally having a real sex life and I got a long-term girlfriend (today I've slept with about 15 women, a feat that previously seemed impossible). I was amazed by my hard work and success, I truly felt like I was on top of the world.

Unfortunately, the girl ended up ruining my life. She thoroughly mistreated me, and I took everything she threw at me because I was just so thankful for the attention. She got a job in a new city, and I decided to get a job there too so that we could begin our life together after college. Unfortunately, said girl went to Mexico on Spring Break and cheated on me before I ever even moved. But, I got a great job, and I decided to make a go of it.

Now, I'm almost 24 and since I made this move, the depression has been back with a vengeance. I can't shake this feeling of inadequacy because I let this girl walk all over me, and now because I moved for her, I still have to deal with this breakup even though it's about 1.5 years later. Something about the way I'm feeling comes out in my actions towards people. Everybody walks all over me, I feel so awkward in everything I do... I have not been effective at my job, which I'm sure comes from the lack of self-confidence.

The worst part is that I feel completely powerless, unlike how I felt before. Every day is such an uphill battle, trying to be normal and feel happy. I work so hard at my job, but I keep making mistakes that I should not be making. Therefore, I feel like I'm spinning my wheels, which hurts the confidence even more.

"Title. Just felt like punching shit while I was in the car on the way back, just wanted to lose control but I didn't. Felt like cutting, going back to the drugs I just got free from, felt like just going back to my old self, just wanna shut myself away. Why does this shit affect me so much. Guess it's just cause it should be easy yet I can't not fail at least once first. Same happened with my permit, I failed the first time and felt worse then than I do now. Guess it's the embarrassment, my family didn't think I would pass anyway, they said they did but I could tell. My friend told me it'd be fine cause it's **easy** so I'd do fine, so where does that leave me. Just makes me feel stupid. I can't retake it for like 3 fucking months either cause I'm going back to school soon. Hopefully this doesnt come up when I'm there, less I talk to people less chance it will happen right, that's just how it is with everything tho. It's fucking embarrassing cause everyone else has already been driving for like 4 years and I just started last year, lucky them, I didn't live here until last year. 
This just sounds more and more stupid the more I talk about it, which it is.

"Side story:
I am never been diagnosed. However, I always remembered back when I was a child that I had some happy moments, but really sad times too. Until I started school at the age of 6, I was always feeling sad and alone. I was bullied often. 
Three years ago, my mom tried to kill herself. She had undiagnosed depression and had been living with it for years. We got her help. We all blamed the depression on her mother that abused her as a child. She is now on antidepressants and is learning to cope with it. 

I'm now 30 years old. I moved to a middle eastern country for work. Been here for 3 years now. I am a huge mess. I have never felt so alone before. I don't have any will to do anything besides just work. I have no family here for support.  I do have 'friends', but they will not understand nor will they really bother to care.  I know that I need help, but in this country, I'm too scared to seek for help. I don't want to end up like my mom. I know I should be grateful for all I have and all the opportunity that life has given me. I should not be selfish, but I still feel dead inside. 
I wish I can move back home... but I will come back as a failure. I won't be able to get any respectable job. My parents would be disappointed in me. I don't want to tell them how I really feel because they will feel like it is their failure as parents that I am this way. They worry too much and I want them to believe that I am happy. 

What the hell am I even saying anymore? 

Point: I know I need help. I have no one to support me. I'm scared to admit to someone I know that I have a problem. I can't go home. I have to make this job a success. 

So i ask: What was the first step you took to get help?  
How did you overcome the fear of being stereotyped?

"I've been depressed for more than a year now, I am a teenager and self-diagnosed but I'm absolutely sure what I've been going through is depression. I confessed to my mother I was depressed once and she felt really awful, asking what she did wrong and it made me feel terribly guilty... so when she asked if I needed to be on medication and get professional help, I lied and said no so she wouldn't feel bad. Anyways, I've been going through these periods where I feel really good. Most of the time I'm content and sometimes I even feel happy. It lasts for a little while, last time for almost a month, and then I start slipping again. It's like a cycle, I'll feel good, then I'm depressed again and then, it gets really bad to where I'm seriously contemplating suicide. I don't want to die, I really don't, even when I say I do... but in those moments, it's serious. I hope you understand what I'm saying, I'm also extremely self-conscious, I've read this over a hundred times. Anyways, currently, I feel good again and I know soon that I'll probably return once again to a depressed state but, I feel really optimistic. This makes no sense, I'm sorry.


WHAT I'M REALLY WONDERING IS: I'm not sure if I should be concerned or not. I want to ask a professional but, I can't tell my mom... so, I came here to ask if anyone knows what this could mean.

"Hi. i need to post this. For the first time in my life i'm feeling lonely, i have always been extroverted and i have a lot of friends that i can call and hang out with but the last week i have been feeling lonely and depressed, manly because of a girl I like. 

I figured I needed to tell someone about it because iÂ¡m pretty shy and i don't want to tell any close friends of mine this. 

First of all, iÂ´m fat, and i feel bad about it I am trying to change it, I donÂ´t like it and i know how bad i look. I have never had a date before and i guess the main reason is because of the way i look, and because of that i haven't gathered the courage to ask anyone out. So, this girls just started working with me and i we started to talk to each other, many because we sit next to each other at the office, and because we both love reading and writing. I figured we had a lot in common so we started to talk about it. Last week I realized i like her a lot, i have never felt anything like it, but i'm really self conscious about the way i look and that if i tell her how i feel i will not know if i will be able to handle a rejection. I will still have to work with her and talk to her and i don't know if i will be able to do that. 

The holly day season didn't helped me either, this new year i spent it with my father at a restaurant and did absolutely nothing. I guess thats when i started to feel this way. 

I thought that telling anyone about this could help me understand why all of a sudden i'm feeling lonely and depressed and know what to do to change it.

"It seems like I was put into a family and city I don't belong in.  So of course I tried to move around to find the right place but since it was right after highschool , I never found a good enough job to sustain myself, so I came home and went back to school.

I've been back half a year, got straights As, and was pretty proud of myself.  The hardest part for me is that I can't find a job, even though ive tried.

Holidays are over, everyone's back to their own life , and I get hit with the backlash.  Saying I'm useless and lazy because I'm not a working and productive person in the world.  My dad basically told me I was a loser and if I'm not working by tomorrow I'm out of the place.  Being told your useless , a loser, losing your place to live, for something you are working for , is a horrible combination to hit someone struggling with anxiety and depression.

This time tomorrow Ill be homeless, and I don't have basically any friends from moving back, so I have no one I can turn to now but my own head is driving me into a downward spiral .

I have been doing good depression wise.  Doing the right things and the next best step, but now I have lost all motivation to even open my eyes. The past 2 days have been me waking and falling asleep crying knowing tomorrow I have nothing and no one, and contiplated ending it .

"SO i think i'm depressed. Like i feel really shitty the time and i honestly want to die. I don't know if i want to do that to my friends and family, but there's a really great girl out there and i wasn't good enough for her. I just turned 16 and i don't think that now is the time for me to leave. I haven't lived a full life yet and that's something i want to do. 

It's all about love for me. I loved that girl so much, and she loved me too but i was too fucked up. I needed more than she could give me and it was too much and she's gone and I get this feeling when i see her in my chest and stomach because when i see her she's happy and i'm just sitting here wanting to die. We still talk and she still likes me, but it doesn't help. I was too much and not enough at the same time. We broke up almost a month ago but it feels useless to try. I don't think she even loved me, even though she may have liked me a lot. If i killed myself she'd be destroyed and that's really why I can't. 

I feel really unmotivated I can't do my homework and midterms are in a few weeks but I honestly don't care anymore. I think I'm going to do everything I can to live for a while. By that i mean live as in experiences. I want to smoke and drink a lot which I've started to do in the past week because it's one of the only things I can enjoy. I used to be able to wrestle which I think would have saved me but I got an injury about a week after my breakup. I have friends that will listen but they don't hear me. All they do is give me advice on things they know nothing about and I'm sick of it. They only do that because they don't want to feel guilty. I know I'm becoming more of a burden than a friend as recently and it kills me.

I haven't really known that depression was a real thing until 9 months ago when i became friends with this really cool girl that to be honest sometimes annoys me, but she's my friend and i love her. She cut, and I honestly didn't really get it. I get it now though, and I wish I could go back to my old naive self. All my friends are naive. I think a lot of them think I'm fine now because the breakup was a little while ago and I don't like to talk to them about how I'm feeling. They're all guys and they're the type of guys who just focus on either school or girls or drugs or video games. My girl friends are the ones that give me shitty advice. A lot of them are depressed too so they can't help me as much and I get that.

I just want to feel her in my arms again. I want to feel the rush of saying I love you and hearing her say it back. I know It won't be the same, even if we do get back together because it wont be because I love her it will be because I need her. 

She's the only thing that makes me happy right now. She knows that, and for some weird reason she still talks to me and she still likes me and misses me but i know i'm not good enough. I feel like because I need her to feel happy, It means I'm not whole. I guess i'm not, like i feel really empty but even more than the empty lost lonely things is the feeling that i'm not good enough. I guess that's why i want to kill myself because i dont think i'm good enough. All i do is start stupid drama because i can't just be happy by myself. I know it's all my fault; I needed too much i gave too much I couldn't be enough for her. I'm just not a full person. I need her for my own happiness and I can't function without her. I'm so co-dependant and i don't know how anyone puts up with me anymore. 

I know a lot of that didn't make much sense, But if anybody read all of that thank you.",4,"feel unmotivated, loved a gril, she loved back but Iscrewed things, she's gone, broke up, smoke and drinkgot into an injury after break up, depressed, alone , confused"
"I'm a people-pleaser. I like to fix, serve and help them, anyway possible  
  
That's kind of how our relationship started. I saw a complex, interesting girl hidden underneath all the darkness surrounding her and decided to help. It was not romantic until a month into knowing each other when I realized that I have just opened up to an almost stranger in a manner I never did.  
  
So, I knew it would be difficult from Day 1. There were so many things wrong with her behavior and I would spent days, weeks, months explaining some things. Sometimes it helped, sometimes it didn't, I never gave up on caring for her. The amount of times I heard from others (her family, friends, herself) about her getting so much better, that it was visible and how they believed in me helping her with day-to-day life. It made me feel that none of my sacrifices are going to waste.  
  
However, she went back to school, last year and she started to revert back to her old ways. I didn't say much at the beginning, hoping it would pass shortly, but it only got worse. She would be disrespectful, mean and cynical towards everything. Cold and cruel. You could say I was almost waiting for my turn, but instead I decided to not be too critical for the moment.  
  
It got worse. To the point where I believed I was going crazy accusing her of any bad behavior. I started to believe her saying ""it's all in your head and your imaginary worlds"". I couldn't take it anymore, the amount of hurt combined with both my heart and mind being broken, it started to affect my work, my lifestyle, my want to live like I used to. I told her about everything, criticized her behavior and in the end all I got was a ""Go fuck yourself. If I'm so terrible, leave me"".  
  
I broke mentally at that moment. I didn't know whether i was going insane or not, I even suggested going to a therapist for both my, her and the relationship's sake and to get some help because clearly I was being overwhelmed, but in the end she said she didn't feel like fixing my problems and that she wants to end things. She grew cold, distant and apathetic in a matter of days and continued to be like that for a month until we broke up.  
  
The breaking up itself... she refused to meet me in person, even after I said it was disrespectful. Again, I was told to fuck off via text and told to finally think about this relationship (like wasn't thinking about it and improving it 24/7 since Day 1...). I told her everything that I thought she could work on with her behavior and said my good-byes. Her last words were ""you finally thought all of it through"".  
  
Not longer three days after the break-up I found from her, now ex, old friend that she started dating another guy and has been hooking up with him for two weeks.  
  
After a few days, she had the audacity to ask me how I was doing. My first question was quite simple ""was any of that real or did you just need someone to help you get back on your feet?"". Her answer crushed the goddamn soul out of me: ""Don't mind it. I already forgot. Just forget it. But take my advice: don't jump into a new relationship instantly, you will be only pouring your old problems over"".  
  
I didn't even bother answering, didn't want to get cruel towards her, I told her friend about this and she cut contact with her in a matter of days saying that she couldn't believe the hypocrisy and that two-faced, disrespectful behavior.  
  
You might be asking yourselves: what's the moral?  
  
I didn't give up on loving people, I still want to help them as much as I can, started volunteering a few days ago. I think the moral is: no matter how shitty life or others treat you, no matter who they are, don't lose love for life and people. I was close to falling back to hate, way too close, probably closer than I ever was my entire life. Never had I had my heart shattered that badly, my psyche that confused, but I also met people with same or worse sicknesses than her and they would never act the way she used to.  
  
I know it's a bit of a stupid story, but I just wanted to emphasize that there are people who genuinely love you for who you are, even when you might not be well or great, even when you are not too nice to others. There will be people along the way, good people, ones that will make you not feel alone ever again.

"I do not consider myself as ever having had depression, but issues of conformity vs individuality, agnosticism/skepticism and romantic love vs. unconditional love for humanity have turned me to a dark place over this winter break and today during the first day of school. 

My relationship between me and my parents isn't close where we say we love each other, make physical contact, or talk a lot, and I fear it is my fault because of how difficult I was in the past possibly, and I also just don't feel love, give love, or subscribe to the idea of love much, only to helping people for the sake of helping people. I guess emotions really are a weak spot for me as an INTP. Many people upon meeting me have noted that I'm very cold and aloof. I was feeling angry at them recently for going against what I believed to be my personal and innate way of living, but now I am not sure. Today at school my teacher said ""how are you"" to me and this girl who had been bothering me for a long time, who I would get angry at but I had never talked to, who seemed to keep smiling at me and looking at me subtly as I would also look at her because I wanted to know what was going on, turned around slightly when she heard that and probably smiled. I still don't feel sure about her intentions but I think she was employing satirical techniques, which we just learned about in class today, and she is in my class, to try to prod me in the right direction, seeing how lonely and disconnected I was. (TO PUT ME OUT OF MY EGOTISM AND WEAK BUT DEEP TOXIC SENSE OF COMPETITIVENESS.) Today in psychology my class also started learning about motivation and emotion, and that was eerily attuned to my situation, because in the past few nights I didn't have motivation to do the work I needed to do, so I failed to do it. I also was going through a lot of different emotions. 


I keep getting sudden feelings that my life has just significantly changed, like today, and I feel like I am so stupid and I don't know how I was able to feel normal before, how I could be blind to it, but it is just so confusing. I find it kind of hard to look back on the past few months and remember what I was thinking. I see myself as just kind of having been a zombie in the past.

So I felt very stupid today, and I was going through my classes in an obviously different mood, which I now regret because I think I looked weird in front of one of my teachers. I kept seeing different ways how I had failed to accept love and integrate it into my life, and how I was nothing without it, how I was such a failure in so many ways. I was considering seeing a school therapist, and I talked to the few friends I had about the day's events, causing stress for them probably. I was skeptical of the idea of love for a long time though, as I wanted to study it in psychology before deciding what to do on that subject, and I kept feeling like I should only love certain people, and not really like or dislike other people but just want to help them when possible. I was always very individualistic and recently I had this silly thought Satan would visit me one night because I could relate to Lucifer. I didn't want to put my faith into anything, not some god or even unconditional love really. But we trust our intuitions all the time anyway, and I don't know what to do. It might just be a kind of unnecessary and bad thing to care so much about being skeptical of everything, and doing so could be egotistic. I have had the idea in recent times that maybe I could completely get rid of the ego and not care how I did compared to others, only focus on being the best I could be. And I don't think that was an idea I didn't accept, I think I accepted that idea.

I should note I had loving feelings for a teacher I have and I was scared to ever interact with her besides just being in the class, but this was something I was holding on to and I had feelings of wanting more of it. Not being able to love makes me feel guilty all the time, and I think I was labelling my problem as not being able to make friends and being lonely but really it was not being able to get and give love with friends and people. I couldn't make friends because I didn't have the right view of people.",4,"issues of conformity vs individualism, agnosticism vs skepticism turend me into a dark place, realtions with parents not close, no , not being able to love meakes me guiltyreal friends, deep toxic sense of competitiveness"
"Graduated from high school in '13 and everything went downhill. 
Lost a significant other of 2 years to a ""best friend"" who enjoyed sex with her, as well as a few other ""friends"" of hers. I was in ""love"" I guess but that spiraled into excessive drinking, partying, drugs, suicide attempts, and problems at home. 

I can't believe I'm still here today, but I lost a lot as things went down the pit. I had some true friends who I ended up abusing their kindness, and there's no chance of them coming back. On top of that, I made a fool of myself to my entire demographic in my hometown. It's a surprise I'm still here today, but at the same time I cannot help but to think of how much less pain I would be in if one of those attempts were successful. 

I'm not considering doing it right now, but I wonder when I'll burn the last of my rope. At this point there's nobody who can help me other than myself, but it's going to be a long and lonely road. 

Here's one for those who tried, and an apology to those who simply had enough.

"Earlier during dinner, my parents were discussing an acquaintance whose son was recently diagnosed with cancer and is currently undergoing treatment. Due to my (secret) lack of willingness to live, I said something to the effect of: ""If I was diagnosed with something horrible like that or even a terminal illness, I wouldn't do anything about it. I'd refuse treatment.""

Of course, like most good parents, they didn't like the idea of their son choosing to die in a situation like that, so we began arguing back and forth about it.

It got pretty heated. I was trying to express that everyone should be allowed to make that decision for themselves and have that decision be respected. I still stand by this, of course, but I've always done much better with written words than spoken ones, and so I wasn't able to express my point very clearly. My emotions easily get the best of me, and it's really hard for me *not* to argue, even if I simultaneously believe that arguing usually hurts more than it helps.

And then, despite the argument getting a little more than heated, my dad calmly said something to the effect of ""I understand why you'd make a decision like that, but as your dad, I'd try my hardest to change your mind anyway. I'd never just let you kill yourself. I'd do whatever I had to do to keep you around. I don't know what I'd do if you were dead.""

I got blindsided by that, and I was almost in tears. I could see it on his face. He was truly, deeply terrified of the idea of me not being around. He wants me to live and be happy. For the first time in a long time, I was able to differentiate selfishness from somebody actually caring about me.

After dinner I spent the next half-hour alone, crying in my bed. My parents have no idea about the depression and anxiety I've suffered from the past six or seven years and how I think about killing myself every day, and how much it meant to me to hear that someone actually cared about my well-being.

I've said some bad things about my parents behind their back, and I feel bad about that. Really bad. None of this is their fault, and I need to do better not to blame them for it.

Realistically, I'm not sure if this changes my situation much. It was a simple reminder that there *are* people who care about me, people that are going to be really hurt if I commit suicide. Up until now, this never mattered to me. I was entirely selfish about it. I can't explain it, but hearing and seeing the concern my parents had for my well-being just *made* it matter, I guess. Maybe I do have a heart after all.

For all the time I've been on this board, I don't think I've ever made a positive post, and I just really wanted to share this with somebody. I actually feel a little better, a little more stable after today's events. Thank you for reading.

EDIT: Thank you everybody for responding. I'm glad this resonated with all of you. I'm going to push myself to be more open with my parents from now on.

"I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a while just to see how other people deal with their depression in hopes that it could maybe help me but for the first time I feel a need to reach out to the community. 

I'm a 21 year old 5'6 asian male adopted into a white family living in the predominantly white New Hampshire, so I've always felt like a bit of an outsider. being adopted I've always felt more indebted to my parents than a real kind of love, so to tell them that I'm unhappy with my life seems like I would be a disappointment to them after all they've done for me. please don't be mistaken, I love them more than anyone else in the world but it's a conflicted and strange kind of love that's hard to describe and hard to understand even for me. 

Being in college I have friends who are mostly tall white guys who are either in relationships, or have sex with random girls fairly regularly. I have nothing against them, nor can I fault them for this however when I hear things like ""getting girls is easy"" or ""I can't believe you're never with a girl"" like it should be easy for me. I feel I'm a social guy, I go to parties, drink at the bars, and hang out with my friends every weekend, but at then end of the night I go home alone. It's not for a lack of trying, I try to dance with and talk to girls but being short and asian almost always leads to immediate disqualification in their eyes. I get a lot of ""I have a boyfriend"", ""you're not my type"", even ""I'm a lesbian"" i've heard it all. I'm constantly described as a nice guy, and I genuinely believe myself to be as such but the constant rejection night after night crushes me. It feels like I'm playing my life on extreme difficulty, and its constantly weighing on me.
(-as a side note I have dated a girl, and we did have sex a few times but it ended rather quickly and wasn't anything serious)

recently I got some real shit news, there was a problem with my transfer of major some 2 years ago. So I found out at the end of my second semester senior year that my transfer into the neuroscience program never went through and since then the required GPA has risen from a 3.0 to a 3.3. As a senior my current GPA sits at a 3.04 so it would be impossible for me to raise it to a 3.3 with the amount of credit hours I have left. As such my only option would be to settle for a psych degree, and I would have to take additional classes. I would not describe myself as a naturally smart person, so I have only survived as a neuroscience student through effort and hard work, something I have always forced myself to do. My entire life I have believed that if you work hard enough things will go your way, however now that I'm faced with this situation I have found out that all the hard work that I've put in for the past 8 years (since start of highschool) has been for nothing. I have all the required classes for a neuroscience degree but administration has told me theres nothing I can do so tough luck. So now the only thing that I have any real pride in has been taken from me and I don't know what to do. 

Depression has always been something that I've battled with for the reasons stated before, but it has never felt heavier or more destructive than it does now. one of the most memorable quotes that I have ever heard is ""Suicide doesn't make the pain go away, it just gives it to someone else"". This has always resonated with me, and has always kept those thoughts at bay, but lately they have become more and more real. I don't think I could ever do it purely based on how it would destroy my family but I'm wake up every day hating myself. 

Honestly thank you to anyone who listened, this is something I have never told anyone, but I needed to tell someone about this monster I'm fighting.

"I created a throwaway just to tell my story. Iâm not sure what else to do at this point. Iâm so upset I canât eat, canât sleep, canât do anything productive, and have nowhere to vent my frustration and no one to vent it to. 

Start with a little about me. Iâm a 38 year old female. Iâve been suffering from clinical depression and anxiety for many years now. Iâve tried treatment, but that only makes me more listless and tired, so Iâm really trying to self medicate with vitamins and exercise, but that doesnât always do the trick. My first thought every morning when I wake up is to put a bullet through my brain. Thankfully, I donât own a gun, and probably donât have the balls to do it, but nonetheless, that is my first thought every single morning. But every day I drag out of bed and continue to live, except for on my days off, in which I rarely make it out of bed, and if I do, itâs just to drink for awhile.

Now a little back story with what I am dealing with tonight. I fell in love at first sight about 25 years ago. Many things happened that made a relationship impossible, and we never acted on our feelings until about 8 years ago. At that time, he had a girlfriend. He left her for me, but due to sticky circumstances we never officially got together (aka living together, etc.) We did spend a really great few years spending almost every day together, travelling a lot and falling in love, or so I thought. Things came to a head after a while, it was a âforbiddenâ relationship from the start due to the aforementioned sticky circumstances. 

About 5 years ago, he met someone else and fell in love with her. She is a very possessive, controlling, manipulative type. Sheâs gotten his head so twisted up, there have been times he has wanted to commit suicide, and comes to me. He went almost a year in the relationship without telling me at all. Once I found out, he continued to break up with her (or her with him) every few months for a week or so and would spend it with me, just to go back to her and drop me like I was nothing. She is a horrible person. From the very beginning I tried to be cordial with her, because I never blame âthe other womanâ when a man cheats. But she treated me like âthe other womanâ from the start, even though we were together first.  As a matter of fact, her first words to me ever were to taunt me saying she âhas my man all the timeâ. At one point during one of his suicidal episodes, I sat right next to him as he texted her saying he wanted to kill himself, and her response to him was âDo itâ.

The last year or so, the break ups have waned, and we honestly have not seen or talked much at all. Our split broke my heart, and I was really just starting to get over it, starting to âlearn to live half a lifeâ like the song goes.  
Two months ago, he called me and asked me to take some time off over the holidays because she was going out of town and he wanted to spend a few days together. At first I was reluctant, because in the past we only ever did this when they were broken up. But I agreed because I just miss him so much, I canât even describe it. I knew I had to end it, but my plan was to spend a last few days in happiness with him then to tell him to let me go. Let things end on that note, give me some closure at least. 

So I took some time off. He called me a few weeks later to tell me he had the dates wrong, and I even went so far as to change my vacation time (even though my boss is not open at all to that sort of thing). I got new tires, got the car serviced so we could take a trip. Itâs really been the only thing keeping me going the last few weeks, knowing that I was going to be happy for a few days. 

Well, the time comes to take the trip. He calls me the night before, telling me he will call me when he wakes up and we can leave. The next morning, Iâm packed, just waiting for his call, could not even sleep the night before because I was so excited. 

That was yesterday morning. I still have not heard a word from him. I finally called his phone tonight and another man answered, saying he was him. Of course I recognized the voice and knew it wasnât him. The man asked me who I was and when I told him my name he said I have the wrong number and hung up. I have sent him a couple of messages with no reply.

So here I sit now wondering how I let myself fall for this, how I let myself go so far out of my way and get my hopes up so much just to be crushed. Again. I wonder if he did all this intentionally just to hurt me, or if something came up, maybe she came home early. I know I have no right to be upset because it was I who was planning on running away with another womanâs man, but I am still upset. Devastated. So let down I donât know what to do with myself.

I know whatever the outcome, a day from now I will be in the same situation I would have been anyways. I would have ended it for good, and still will, but I guess I had in my mind how that was going to go, and this is not what I had planned. 

I just need to know how to get this weight off my chest, this lump out of my throat, how to force myself to eat or even get out of bed (except to drink which makes it worse). I thought about using the rest of my vacation doing something productive, but I seriously cannot even. I just donât understand why he would do this to me. I never asked for this, he planned it all, just to let me down again. And for what? And I canât even yell at him, because he wonât speak to me. Half of me just wants to tell her everything just to get revenge, just to hurt him too. But I know that will only make me feel worse. 

I wonder what I ever did to be treated like this. I wonder how I can keep living. I was in a very bad mental state before this, and Iâm afraid this might just put me over the edge. I guess I just needed someone to hear my story. So here it is.

But, he got back with his second ex who then abused him some more. She would cut if he wouldn't talk to her, laugh at his misfortunes. I was the one he went crying to every damn time. I was there when nobody else was.

They broke up, big suprise and he asked me out. I said yes and entered two happiest months of my life. Followed by the 4 most miserable months until he finally showed me mercy and dumped me.

He would constantly mock how skinny and pale I am. How my scars are easily noticeable, gee I never noticed. Laughed at my stories of abuse. But I loved him. I was stupid and I deserved to hurt.

As said in the title, I am 14 years old. I am struggling with terrible memory. I will give a few examples.

At school we were passed out tests. Since we share tables, we got 4 papers on one table. I wrote my name down and was waiting for further instructions until I heard someone say ""wow you are fucking retarded"" to me. I was in shock. I asked why acting like my feelings weren't hurt and he held up two papers to my face. I wrote my name on two papers. I didn't know how it happened and nobody else wrote it because it was my writing. I know I did it. And to be honest, I was about to write my name on a third paper. 

When a friend pours out his heart telling me about his problems and personal problems, I forget them within 10 minutes and when I asked him what it was again he thought I was a terrible friend. I didn't know what to do. 

There's not a day at school I have kept one pencil throughout the whole day. I always forget and I can tell the teachers are pissed because I am constantly asking if they have one.

I constantly ask my friends about questions in class and I asked him so many times he told me to shut the fuck up. He apologized and was just angry I was constantly bugging him but now that I can't ask him it is affecting my grades.

Speaking.of which, my grades are plummeting. My father asked if I am studying and doing my homework and I am, I study every night even on breaks and I still fail. I once studied for a quiz for three hours and got a 46 percent. 

I can't remember my childhood. I forget I had one. It's almost like I was born at the age of 12 because that's as far as I can remember. I have no memories of my childhood.

I loved my grandma. Ever since I was a baby I constantly went to her house on the weekends and she was like a parent to me. We were tight. When she passed away from the evil hands of cancer I couldnt remember her face. I cried to god because I could not remember her. I asked what was wrong with me. So far, religion has helped me none.

I have not told anyone this but I still don't know my multiplication tables. I'm not even good with addition. If you asked me what 8 * 9 is I would take a calculator for me to figure it out. A high school teacher pointed it out to me and I have been hurt ever since. I remember I forgot everything over the summer of 5th grade, and when 6th grade came along I had to ask my teacher how to multiply. She thought I was an idiot. All she said was ""Ha, you don't know yet?"". Looked at me like I was an alien. I looked at her for a minute and said nothing. Then went back to my seat, sat down, and thought I was a fool.

I told him, ""I can't wait until you fucking die."" What i said to him haunts me every fucking day. He called the cops on me and I was admitted.

I start my paramedic class today. I don't want to stop there. I want to be a doctor like my dad. He's literally everything I aspire to be. I wish I could let him know how much I look up to him now. Sadly, it's what I said to him when I was admitted that I remember. 

I just really wanted to vent. I know we all got to the point we're at in a different way, But we're all fighting the same condition. There's a reason you guys are still here. You want to fight this shitty fight. It's not cause you're to scared to die. You think fear would prevent you from escaping? Fuck no! I love all you guys who fight this hellish condition. Keep it up! I believe in all of you! Thanks for reading. Sorry if this looks like shit, alcohol.",4,"prozac 60 mg,depression, dad dying,  want to be a psychiatrist like father,just want to vent"
"I'm sorry if this seems to be a ramble, but I need to get this out. I've been reading this sub for a while, but made a new account to comment. Sometimes I find it helpful to get everything out, and I don't have anyone left to get things out to who won't try and pity me. 

Depression runs in my family, but I'm probably using that as a crutch or an excuse. I think I'm depressed.

I go through stages of downs and (sort of) ups, though those usually manifest themselves as drives to fix the problems in my life - while never working out and making the situation worse.

Today my girlfriend called me selfish. Truth is, it's her birthday tomorrow and I haven't gotten her anything. She knows this, I haven't even gotten her a card. The reason is, I have a lot of personal debt - we both do. I spent my last Â£2 on a sandwich yesterday so that I could eat, and now I have to hope that the rest of the month ""works out"" somehow. It's 13 days until pay day.

I don't have a bad paid job, but circumstances this Christmas left me short for cash - I usually run out a few days before pay day not two weeks.

She knows about my debt, some of it's hers, but I she doesn't seem to get it, how bad it is.

I used to hurt myself. That was a long while ago, and I couldn't do it today for fear of actually having to explain myself. So there's no risk there. I'm just ready to...I don't even know. I'm broken. Help.

"A lot of really crappy things happened to me starting around this time last year, but I still felt alright because I had my friends, my band, &amp; especially a really great boyfriend. I have never felt as happy to be alive as when I was with him. But my band broke up, I fought with my best friend &amp; we don't talk any more, I lost more &amp; more friends, then eventually found myself single. I can't think of anything I've done to deserve losing everyone like this &amp; no one will tell me why it all happened. So now I have no confidence. I constantly wonder if I'm a good person because I don't understand why this happened if I am good. I'm afraid to make new friends because I don't think anyone will like me or that the new friends would eventually leave me, too. Probably also without an explanation. I also can't seem to get booked for any shows (playing music). I've struggled with depression &amp; anxiety my whole life, but never like this. I don't know what to do. I don't want to burden what few people I can still call friends with this because I want them to be happy &amp; I think it would just drag them down. Not to mention that I don't really trust anyone anymore. Just feeling so discouraged &amp; lost &amp; trapped.",4,"band  broke up, fought with best friend, dont deserve losing everyone, afraid to make new friends,new friends will leave me, dont want to burden people"
"So girl I like is very flirty when she's drunk. Actually that's the reason we're not together. She knows that it hurts me and she doesn't wants that. Recently she found someone and thought he was the one, even started to avoid me I'm guessing cuz she didn't want to hurt me. Well he didn't last and was only using her and we started talking again. 

Last weekend we went out with some friends she got drunk and flirted with some random guy again which it didn't affect me much. When he left she flirted with one of my friends. That actually affected me. The weird part is that she wanted to dance with me but only in private but she has no problem dancing with some guy or even friends.

I don't know what that means. Damn it girls are complicated. She keeps treating me different idk if that's good or not. She won't text me but gets offended if I don't text her for long periods. Is she playing with me? Wth is going on? 

Thanks for reading this long. It sucks being me right now. I've become so confuse and insecure just from one girl.

"I'm sitting here just reading all your guy's and girl's posts feeling like all you are. Let me just share whats going on in my life for a moment...

I'm 25 living with one of my grandparents taking care of her because she's old and can't get around. I love her to death and would do anything for her, but I would never tell her any of this because I feel like I need to shoulder everything. She is battling her own grief due to the loss of her closest sister and sister-in law. It was two weeks ago when one of my aunts past away (grandmas sister-in-law) and four months who I was closest (and my grandmas sister) with, who was my whole world. The hole in my heart just keeps getting bigger and I don't know how to stop it. She use to be my compass and now I feel completely lost without her. I also took care of her for about the last eight months of her life and felt like it just went by so quickly. I traveled with her when I was younger and had so many memories... now knowing shes gone I can't help but cry whenever something that reminds me of her pops up in my head.

I also got out of a six year relationship about two years ago which was horrible and I have a lot of scars (emotional) that I still haven't shaken off. I've been battling with loneliness and depression for a long time now. We would constantly fight towards the end of our relationship, but there was a time she showed me what it was like to have a real connection with someone. I pursued one or two other women after the one, but they never were looking for anything serious. I have friends who complain about their girlfriends/boyfriends and I just sit their sometimes thinking to myself...at least you have someone. I would give anything I feel to have a connection with anyone now a days, I feel like when it comes to being by myself I go into a dark corner in to my mind I can never escape. Almost feels like I'm sinking into a giant ocean and I can see the light slowly fading away and this huge amount of pressure keeps crushing me. 

I have a few friends and a lot of family members, and their company is like a drug that I try to cling on to. Two of my friends are kind of close, but they have their own lives and we don't see each other often. Most of my other friends are gone in other schools far away. My family also is kind of disconnected. When we get together it can be amazing, but their something inside myself that clicks and I hide my depression with them. They always can have a blast with each other but I feel so disassociated with them I don't feel like I belong. When it comes to parting ways I know what comes next when I'm by myself. I've told one of my relatives once, but they couldn't understand what I was going through. I've told my mom also, but she just doesn't quite know exactly what I'm feeling. She tries, but it just hurts me knowing I'm misunderstood. My friends wouldn't understand so I never tell them. 

I try to keep myself busy by going to school, reading, video games, leaving but the escape is only brief. I can't find a permanent cure for what I'm feeling. I just find myself laying in bed most of the time....trying to battle myself and never winning. Its been a few years...and I'm still depressed. I know this may not be intense as some of your guys's battles but thanks for reading if you got down this far.",4,"living with grandmother to care, lost two aunts, got out of a six year old relationship, batteling with lonliness and depression"
