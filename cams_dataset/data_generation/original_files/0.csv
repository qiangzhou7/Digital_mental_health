I now understand that the possibility of taking my own life would be the most brainless decision I could ever make and I am thankful that I didnât no matter how bad shit may be in my life.

"Hi, I'm Jake. I'm from England where it's currently 00:06 and I'm not sure why I'm writing this but I guess I need to put my thoughts somewhere (like a diary of sorts.)
I've felt dreadful for about 3 years now, progressively getting worse to the point of hating every fibre of my being. I've never really spoken to anyone about my thoughts or feelings, so maybe I'm not depressed, maybe it's normal to feel like this, but something tells me it isn't.
However, I am not here for sympathy. I'm writing this because I intend to turn my life around in 2018, I want to lose weight, put more work into university, maybe pick up some hobbies and TRY to be more social. So I intend to return to this post in 3 months or 6 months or a year when I've hopefully managed to change my life for the better, and I hope YOU can do the same, whoever you are, wherever you are.

"To me, depression is a gaping pit I always spiral down into, further into darkness. It's not something you can rid yourself of JUST with a positive attitude, but I'd like to believe that it helps. My reasons for posting this is to vent, but also that someone may feel that they can get something out of this.

So I wanted to write something with the emphasis on that ONE thing I got going for me in 2017, and that I hope to bring with me to 2018. I internalize most things, but I do realize how others have a very strong impact on my well-being, and for the first time, I got some warm feelings.

but that doesn't make it any less true

It's the new year nothing and I still ain't got a clue,

depression is alive in whatever place I lay and hang

hoping for a miracle, but I think that one is you,

stick around to witness, I'm starting something new

caught up with my shadow, the myself that I once knew,

I gotta say, you got me feeling great through and through

self-pity was the norm, but now I look foward to

So, you know those people that don't really have depression but pretend they do? Yeah, this is me. It doesn't mean life is easy for me, everything is still very difficult and was like that for the past 5-6 months. It's just not bad enough to be called depression. Everybody else has it much, *much* worse. I just don't really feel good anymore. And I just know that I'm pretending and I don't really deserve anything because of this. I'm just in this gray zone where it's not bad enough to remotely think about getting any help I don't deserve but not good enough for me to be happy. And everything is just getting worse.

"This is quite difficult to talk about with people I know, or therapists for that matter, so I'm hoping this platform of strangers will make things easier...

I've had these thoughts for roughly 5-years now, with the exception of a 4-month stretch, when I felt happy (literally for the first and only time). 

The thought of killing myself is not only terrifying, I know that it's wrong (in every sense of the word). I'd never want to put my family through that, nor myself; however, I can't help but fantasize about the idea of some freak accident occurring to put me out of this misery.  

My struggles with my happiness stem from a very young age, and things simply have not gotten better. The 4-month stretch was beyond surreal. It was when I realized I had never been happy before, and unfortunately not since. 

The idea of some freak accident ending my life is so appealing; it would end my depressing thoughts and feelings, would take the guilt off of my hands (instead of doing it myself), and while it would still be crushing to my family, it wouldn't have the added drama of ""what could we have done to help?"" The idea of living life for another ~50-years with the absence of happiness truly sounds awful, not worth it in the slightest.

"Why do you think you don't deserve to be happy?

Is it because you think you are a bad person or that you made a bad decision?  Is it because you think you have nothing to offer to the world?  What if I told you that you don't have to be a bad person.  Forgive yourself for making a bad decision and promise yourself you won't do it again, what good is it to continue to beat yourself up about it?  It is not making you a better person, you are not becoming happier.  You may think you have nothing to offer; but I bet when you convince yourself you do, you will have something to offer.  If you think you don't deserve to be happy, you are wrong.

Being happy isn't just going to come to you.  You aren't going to wake up feeling like you are on top of the world.  You have to make it happen.  You have to decide to get up and be the best you can.  It takes practice to be happy, you have to work at it.  

Depression, atleast from my point of view, has been highly self inflicted.   I chose to stop eating, I chose to stop trying, I chose to stop caring, I chose to stop talking to those around me, and I chose to stop doing the things I once loved to do.  

I and you need to choose to to be happy.  You need to choose to get healthy.  You need to choose to get out of bed. You need to choose to start caring.  You need to choose to love those around you.

Someone loves you, if you don't think that then I believe someone will love you if you put yourself in the position for them to love you.  

You deserve to be happy.  You REALLY deserve to be happy.  Try to be happy, no matter how hard it may seem.  Being happy is the point of life.",0,choose to love those around you

My emotions have been getting out of hands lately and I'm so tired.,0,
"Hey, first post on here!
I feel weird. I don't feel bad, just weird. I've been feeling like this for quite a while. Like two years or something.
Let me give you some background. I'm a 16 y/o dude living in Norway. I have it well. Life is good to me. 
I get good grades at school (B/A), I have (some) friends, I have a nice family (my parents got divorced ~3 years ago, but that's fine).
Everything is just fine.

But somehow I feel like my whole life is ""meh"". I don't see any point in doing anything. 
I have hobbies; I like video games, I play the piano, I make videos, I do some photography. I have interest in politics. 
I go to a school where I do things I like; photography, video game design (yes, Norway is weird and privileged), video editing etc.

I just lose motivation so quickly. ""Oh, I'll play this game."" Ten minutes go by. ""Uh, this is boring/unrewarding/I could be doing something better/etc."" 
Or; ""Oooh, I'll make this video game."" I work on it for 2 days. ""I could just go back to not doing anything, and not have to do this.""
I've been trying different things. I don't know why this happens, really. Do I think long-term before I think short-term?

One good (recent) example of this is New Year's Eve; everyone is emotional and screaming ""Happy New Year"" like it's some sort of rebirth. No. 
The number in the calendar is different, and there's gonna be another Christmas in 12 months. That's all there is to it in my opinion.

I don't know, is there some secret to life? Am I just gonna one day wake up, feel completely different, and have endless energy to do everything?

(P.S. I don't know if this qualifies as ""depression"". If this shouldn't be posted here, could somebody direct me to somewhere this can be posted?)",0,

Should I tell her I wanna die ? Or will that lend me in a ward ? 

Should I take pills even tho I keep reading how people regret ever getting them and want to get off them and the withdrawals are the worst thing they have ever had to go through ? It kind of discourages me..

"Since ""obviously"" we depressed people are just ""helpless souls"" who need to be ""saved"" by the ""normal people"". ""Obviously"" you get to delegitimize this entire space just because there aren't ""normal people"" here trying to ""save us from ourselves"" and ""enlighten us"" and ""teach us the true way to live"". They say ""just be happy"", GOLLY GEE you think I haven't fucking thought of that yet?

Sometimes depressed people don't want help. Of course, help is absolutely necessary sometimes, but quite frankly it's none of your business to come into our spaces and tell us how we have to act or what we have to say. If you have depression sometimes you need a place to just rant. 

It's nobody's obligation here to ""solve depression"". The point isn't to ""save"" depressed people. This is not the place for non-depressed people to try to ""save us"" and feel good about themselves in the process. This is a place where people who are trapped in suffering get to scream into their pillows and maybe have someone there who hears them and understands them and maybe even responds to them. This isn't a clinic and it doesn't need to be.

I hate this, I should be happy, I should be enjoying my winter break and not sitting in my bed at 3am complaining on the internet. I wish I had the confidence to ask the girl I've had a crush on for the past year out, or at least be self aware enough to be able to convince myself that she's just not interested. Fuck this. I hate feeling like shit all the time while my life is actually going alright and then feeling fine for months at a time even though everything is falling apart.

"Im shocked. I didnt realize how much I had lost. Im not thin by any means, but... Im not really that fat anymore. I think im one of the healthiest people in my family (though most of them are obese or suffer eating disorders). Ive gotten so used to my diet, but now I need to maintain what I have. Losing much more would affect me negatively... But it makes me sad that I still dont like my appearence.

I expected I would just suddenly find myself attractive if I hit the right weight, but I still dont. I dont know how to feel about it... I know I should be happy that Ive fulfilled something ive been working on for 3 years, but I still dont feel good enough. Hard to believe people when they say you look good when you cant even get a girlfriend, you know? Guess that counts as a rant. I dunno.",0,
"I recently remembered this very vivid moment from my childhood: I was probably 9 years old, and I distinctly remember feeling hopeless and wanting to kill my self. I was crying and screaming that nobody loved me and I wanted to die.

"I'm sorry.

My entire life, until recently, I thought depression was merely another word for being sad.  I had thought it was just a feeling that would quickly go away.  I had thought that depression was something that was not a big deal, that it was more of a joke than anything. Whether it be society telling me that it wasn't serious or if it was just me being nieve; I need you to know I'm sorry I held these beliefs. 

Until you experienced it, you can never really understand just how terrible and debilitating it is.  I read some of your stories and a peice of me breaks.  I can't even start to begin to comprehend how some of you must feel.  I don't want to downplay my own experience (because I now know depression, no matter the severity, is serious) but it seems so miniscule compared to some of your struggles.

I can't believe there was once a time where I would even ask my self, ""Why can't these people just be happy."". If only it was that easy.  I really wish it was.  From the bottom of my heart, I wish you the best in 2017.  Merry Christmas, happy holidays and make this year great.

I'm sorry.",0,
"You see, I work as a horticulturist, we deal with shrubs, weeds and other shorter plants. My job is so-so, but I hate the idea of working.

So how do I stay sane? Well, there are plenty of red ants from time to time, and those little rays of sunshine loves to attacking anything in their vicinity, even if that thing is there to tend to their home.

I've been bitten several times now, and it hurts quite a bit. So, these days I love repaying the favor, it'd be selfish if all I do is take without giving right?

I'll stomp on them, crush them with my gloved hands, and my personal favorite, after they manage to climb onto me and bite me... Is to smack them lightly, enough to cripple and disorient, then I pull them apart, limb from limb... All the while asking it, ""how does it feel to be the one getting hurt?""

If I were to go and see a GP and they prescribed something, how much would they usually prescribe? Is it a large amount of medication? Does it state whether they are anti-depressants usually?

"Today is another really low day for me.

I was forcibly admitted to the hospital twice for attempted suicide (pills, and cutting respectively) and eventually got hooked up with a sliding scale office that had therapists in the West Seattle area that got me on a biweekly visit and eventually prescribed antidepressants. 

Over the past three years, I have moved multiple times, to different states, and recently moved back to Washington State. I had a counselor in West Seattle that got me the recommendation for antidepressants and they seemed to work for me; but after moving around (and losing most everything I owned in the process) I am thinking I need to get back to both therapy and medication; however, I donât remember her name or phone number. West Seattle is a long distance from where I currently live in Federal Way, but I donât know anywhere else to turn to.

Does anybody have an idea of how to find a sliding scale clinic in the area? When I google sliding scale clinics, I donât get many, if ANY, therapists, just dentists and pediatric doctors.

"I have been depressed for the past 3 years. In the last year my mind descended into the darkest depths. I had thoughts I never could have imagined myself having. However, after a few marijuana-induced ego killing trips, I realized that I was the cause of my own depression. I always thought that this was the hand that the universe dealt me and I would have to continue living a life with no joy. However, this was the way I looked at life because THIS WAS THE WAY I WANTED TO LOOK AT LIFE. I realized that my perception actually created my reality and that all the help that people were offering me was actually genuine. My ego just didn't want to accept the fact that people actually cared about me and therefore I continued to spiral down deeper into depression.

Now, its a New Year and I know what I have to do to better my life, however I need help figuring out how to do it. I am wondering if anyone has any experiences with depression and could give me tips on what they did to slowly rehabilitate themselves to their former mental space before depression. I know I will never be 100% and perfect but right now it's like my mind is a fog and it's slowly clearing but I haven't seen sunshine in so long and part of me still wants to stay in the fog because it's comfortable and I am used to it.",0,
"I've personally thought about it -- several times a week when times were bad, and each time it was ruled out as a non-viable solution. I do, however, consider it an option on the table if circumstances call for it. 

The issue I want to address is the stigma on suicide.

I know people that have been clinically depressed for decades, and I've watched them take no joy out of life. Why prolong it if you've been dealt a shitty hand? Is society being selfish in wanting to see that people can change for the better just to affirm its own views of the world? The mere mention of suicide brings throngs of people trying to ""help"", and often instilling false hope. Will we ever ever say, ""yeah, it's a shitty situation. Offing yourself is probably the best option.""

There is no cure for clinical depression, and I bet those who eventually do kill themselves were dragged through the mud before they did it, effectively prolonging their suffering.
