"   Itâs been a good break so far, as school is the source of most of my triggers for depression and Iâm also in Florida which helps combat seasonal depression, but somethingâs off. I just feel unsatisfied. Like, now that Iâm feeling better, Iâm seeing how bad Iâve been living. I see what I want to improve now, but itâs overwhelming. Iâm so close to having energy to take on these challenges, but right now I still hardly have energy to get out of bed.

"18 years old and have been depressed for almost 5 years now. My dream is to be a professional singer or actor. So many people tell me that the chances of making it is literally one in a million. I always feel depressed because I realize that they may be right and this never leaves my mind through out the day. I look up to the musical artists and actors, and I always just wonder how they became who they are. I feel like there is no reason to continue living when what you want the most in life isn't there. Appreciate if someone read this and could give their input. Thanks",2," dream is to be a professional singer, or actor, no reason to live,what you want the most in life isn't there"
"Iâm tired of worrying my friends and loved ones by posting things where they can see them so I just made this account to talk here. Talk of self harm to follow, sorry. Also itâs kind of my life story lol.

I started thinking about killing or hurting myself in high school- the summer between freshman and sophomore year I just took a fucking nosedive. I totally retreated into my head, cut off every friend I had made my first year besides literally two. I took an exacto knife from art class and started cutting my hips (because no one would see them there.) The only person who saw was my best friend while I was changing at her house. Sheâs not someone who shows a lot of emotion, but Iâd never heard her gasp like that or seen her as shocked and hurt as I did right then. To this day, sheâs the only person who knows I do that. (Also, somehow, she was willing to date me and we are still together 7 years later.) 

I barely passed high school (I think the only reason I didnât go to summer school is because they literally forgot about me.) I remember once admitting to the guidance counselor I hurt myself, and it was a huge force of effort for me to admit that. All she said was âThatâs not good,â and I never saw her again. I have no idea why I told her and not the actual therapist I was seeing at the time. The therapist might have done something. 

Then I tried college. I somehow go into a decent art school. My freshman year was absolutely fucking miserable. No friends (well, one, but we never did anything besides hang out in our rooms), horrible roommate, tanking grades. I just stopped showing up to class at one point near the end of the year because I knew it was pointless. The small scholarship I had somehow managed to get (which I think was just a result of me coming from an inner city school) was taken away within the first semester. I had just thought I might not have been able to do traditional school, but maybe I would do well in art school. Clearly, I was wrong. Obviously I dropped out. I told my parents I was taking a gap year but...lol. We all knew it was a lie. Three years later and I have zero plans to go to any college at all. 

I constantly make jokes about me dropping out around my friends and parents. Iâve always done that; deflecting my pain with humor. I guess I think if I joke about it enough itâll stop hurting so much. Whatâs even harder is I am still close friends with my one college friend- and they are graduating in a few months from what I view as my biggest failure. 

All my friends are going to college and doing well. My girlfriend is getting an accelerated masterâs degree. Sheâs very school smart and has always done very well. Iâm going with her to a networking party in a month or so as her plus one- Iâm going to support her but Iâm afraid Iâm just going to start crying being surrounded by all these successful people because I know I will never be that. Iâm so scared Iâm going to drag her down for the rest of her life. Sheâs so smart and driven and is going to be very successful and I am going to work a shitty retail job like I have now for the rest of my life. I know she loves me but every time she tries to compliment me and tell me that I have value I just get angry because I feel like sheâs just saying that. My brain shuts down when people try to talk to me about my future because I can barely picture myself being alive tomorrow, let alone in a few years. 

I never cut every day, just when I was feeling intense emotional pain that needed to be let out somehow. Iâve never made it a full year without doing it- but some years Iâve gone 6 or 7 months without. But lately Iâve been thinking about it constantly. I just keep a knife in my room now for easy access. I had a party with several friends last week. After they all left, I felt lower than I had in months. It was Christmas Eve, and I was just lying in bed sobbing and bleeding from my hips. I have several plans for events and trips in january- and yet I canât get excited for them or feel anything at all. I feel like things are going to get very bad for me (even worse than they have been) very soon. And the worst part is that itâs almost a comforting thought.

"4 am, can't sleep, as always. I really need to get this out of my chest. I apologize for the long text, but I really need some advice. My life is s complete mess atm and I don't know what to do.

Long story short, I'm 20 years old uninteresting guy, whose future has no purpose at all. I've never had a girlfriend, I'm studying a degree I don't like all and I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, with minimal chances for getting better.

It all started when I was 15. I went to the hospital because I thought I was having some sort of heart attack. After many cardiac exams, I was later diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder. Although, the fear of dying still haunts me constantly. 

 Due to this fact and some other conditions, my grades started  gradually decreasing. At the moment, I'm at the 3rd year of my graduation, studying retail management at a small university. I hate the subjects I'm studying. Every time I wake up and think about needing to the classes, I get more and more demotivated. Needless to say I already failed several subjects and my grades are shit. I can't see myself doing this professionally, but it's too late to give up now, my parents paid for 3 years of studying and I can't disappoint them and waste their money completely. Back in days, I really like Informatics Engineering and Psychology, but due to my awful high school performance, my grades weren't high enough to ingress in any of these graduations. 

My only interests now are music, sports betting, writing, photography and videogames, but there's no real way I could make money and live on that. My self-esteem is as low as it can be, no girl seems to find interest in me. I might be really ugly or I lack some serious social skills. I can count my friends with a single hand, and we usually spend most of the times playing videogames, so I don't go out that much. I find to make a good first impression sometimes, but then I always screw everything up. The only things keeping me on track are drinking, smoking, gambling and occasionally doing drugs.

I wish I had the guts to pack my things up and start a new life somewhere else, but I'm a coward. Every day is a fucking nightmare, I feel slowly getting  physically sick, depressed and more hopeless as the time goes by. I can't stand myself and my life, but I lack the power, energy and motivation to change it.",2,"hate the subjects I'm studying, failed several subjects and my grades are shit, suffer from anxiety ,"
"i ended 2016 as a recent graduate from a top notch university with a degree in probably the most unemployable field, 30k+ in debt, back at home, and cut off ties with all friends.

i predicted that 2017 would bring me a mediocre job i could've gotten in high school, that i probably wouldn't last a few months at that job, that my parents would be paying off my loans because i can't, and that i would probably stay in my room 90% of the year.

it all became true. i lasted only the training period of my job and resigned 1 week into the first full week of work. my parents' have paid 8 months for my student loans. i'm not paying rent. i'm well fed. and despite having only seen friends only 3 days at the beginning of the year then ending them off with an argument or complete silence on my end, i'm okay with it. birthday and holiday greetings unreplied to. concerned voicemails and texts gradually decreasing from daily to weekly, to monthly, to never.

as for 2018, i only predict the same. no contact with friends. me still leeching off of my parents. maybe they'll snap one day and tell me to go back to a job that i'll only end up resigning yet again because of anxiety. maybe i'll stay at the job out of guilt.

it's gotten to a point where i'm not even sad for myself. i've just accepted it. i'm just one of those examples of the ""smart"" kid growing up, following the rules, the teacher's pet that becomes unsuccessful because they only know how to live by what others tell them to do. yet, i can't even succeed in the system because once i finally made mistakes, i never knew how to cope, even up to now. and that's where i'm at. in this limbo of being an ""adult"" yet living as if i were a toddler. maybe the saddest part is my parents tolerate it.

i know at some point things will have to change. it's the in-between of not knowing what the next step is or what will fix my situation that leaves me feeling like there i don't have a reason to exist.",2,"most unemployable field, in debt,cut off ties with all friends,stay at the job out of guilt"
"I have a long story but don't feel like giving all the details right now..

I graduated high school 6 months ago. I was supposed to move elsewhere and work for about a year before deciding whether I should go to college. Those plans didn't take place, so... I've been staying at home since then.

Yet, long before that (Perhaps for the past 2 or 3 years), I've been really declining, just barely passing my classes and even failing calculus twice. Slowly spiraling into depression although I was never  sure until now.
And now that I'm out.. I'm pretty much depressed. So many things that stress and worry me. I can never get anything done, I never feel interested in anything, I always feel tired.. And yet my mom has kind of been pushing me into getting a job while the move situation gets resolved. It really seems like the right thing to do.
Yet the idea just feels terrifying. Like I KNOW I should find one, bu I also dread the idea. Probably my anxiety acting up, but also because I worry it'll only make me worse. I'm constantly on-edge and just about anything can ruin my mood for the rest of the day. In my mind, I tell myself that I'm in no condition to work full-time but then I feel guilty because that might just be an excuse.  
And just a few minutes ago, a cousin messaged me saying there was a spot I could take at a hotel that he works at. And again.. That feeling of dread, the guilt for even feeling like this, and overall just wanting to decline but not knowing how to say it.

"I am a line cook, I have been for five years. At this rate, this may be my fate for the rest of my life. 

Iâm currently getting a marketing degree, but Iâm honestly not too sure what I will do with it. Iâm pretty anxious, so talking to people and selling things can be tough, though Iâm pretty good at talking when I know what Iâm talking about. 

Working in a kitchen is such an easy trap to fall into. I can make about 25,000 a year doing it, and cooking is a passion of mine. Iâm afraid that I wonât be able to get a âreal jobâ and Iâll be stuck here the rest of my life.

I'm nearly fucking homeless, just barely making it by the skin of my teeth, with little to nothing going for me, with mounting debts, and somehow the majority of fucking people aren't dealing with this shit. I just don't fucking get it. How on Earth did my life turn out to be so fucking shitty, yet somehow most of everyone else is doing way better than me. I know a lot of people in my situation too.

"Been having some weird stuff happen to my personality/mood and I think that it might be depression. The only thing is that I donât really feel sad? Here is a post I made earlier describing what is happening to /r/askdocs


I have noticed or been told things about myself recently that I donât feel are consistent with me in the past. My feelings are dulled, I talk in somewhat of a monotone (people tell me, I canât hear it), and sometimes I donât make any facial expressions so people think that I donât like them when I really do. Often I will be in a social environment and people will say my name to pull me out of a kind of thoughtless trance where I stare off into the distance with a blank mind, I never remember it starting, just being pulled out of it by someone else. I sometimes get asked if I am high when I am stone cold sober.

I have also been having some weird thoughts, like to jump off of a balcony to my death, or violent ones like to stab someone with a knife I am holding or to crash my car on purpose. (I donât want to do either of these things, I will just get a thought like âdo it, stab them in the neckâ or something) I would like to emphasize that I am not suicidal or even unhappy at all. Sometimes I look in the mirror and something looks off about me that I canât put my finger on, I look like someone else. Also different people often ask me âare you ok?â This bugs me because I am always ok, do I have a weird look on my face or something? I never hear them ask other people that, what is wrong with me, it makes me think that I am mentally challenged or something and everyone has been told except for me. There might be more stuff but I canât remember.

All of this stuff has happened in the past year, maybe because of stress? I am a 19 year old male, moved away to college this year so big life change but these things were happening before then also. Help/suggestions much appreciated.

"I know this sort of post isnât original or whatever but here it is. 

Itâs New Years Eve today where I am and honestly... I donât think I could care any less. 

Iâm so tired of pretending to give a shit about everything. About people about things about university and assignments. Mostly Iâm tired of other people pretending to give a shit about me because they donât. Thatâs it. They donât. 

My family say they care yet constantly bombard me with all of their problems expecting me to have a magical solution. My friends are going through their own shit and whilst they try thereâs nothing they can do for me. My girlfriend well... thatâs something else entirely. I know sheâs not happy. I know sheâd rather not be with me. Sheâs been down this road before got the T shirt she shouldnât have to deal with my bs too. I love her so much I donât want to put her through this. 

But the issue is I canât ever see myself getting better. It feels impossible. All I want to do everyday is stay in bed. I want to sleep all of the time. Half the time Iâm not even physically tired I just... everything is too much effort. I canât win. I really canât. Iâve been trying for years but it never gets better. Not for people like me. Weâre destined to suffer and bleed and cry forever. What sort of life is that?

"This is really long btw. So if nobody reads it I understand

I donât even know how to start this off. Iâm just in so much pain. My mind has become my prison. I have so much self hatred. Iâm also self destructive. 

I moved halfway across the country after high school cause I thought itâd make me happy. Start new and leave all the negative behind. Move in with my dad and start working full time. I eventually move out to my own place. I was so unhappy about my job. I would also feel embarrassed to tell people where I worked. 

So my new mission was to find a better job. Family member hooked me up with a really great job. For a 21 year old kid with no degree this job was great. I was prob making too much money for someone my age lol. A lot of dumb spending and lots of drunk nights. 

The job really did help me out. I use to live in this duplex that had nasty carpet. I had no furniture and I had no plates or anything of that nature. Just my bedroom stuff, one entertainment center with a tv in my living room, and some rickety old stained blue recliner. 

Eventually I put down wood floors and furnished my entire place from top to bottom in a matter of months. I even opened up a good credit card and started building my credit. Was the first time in my life I was able to save money and not live paycheck to paycheck. Lol I even had a health savings account that later paid to have my wisdom teeth removed. I really went far and I was proud of myself for once. 

It just wasnât enough though. I was still in so much pain. A job I loved turned into a job I loathed. I think I was genuinely happy for a couple months max. I ended up working there for two years and some change. 

I left when I decided I should go to school. Iâm in a town with a great school and my family has gone to this school for generations. So I put in a month notice at my job and started taking steps to get myself ready for the college life. 

My first semester was a breath of fresh air. I loved it. I loved going to class and doing something I actually wanted to do. That lasted for a whole semester and a minimester. My next full semester? I almost failed this semester. I was very close to getting out on academic suspension. I stopped going to class halfway through. I donât even know if I want to do it anymore.

Iâm just running in circles. I think something will be good for me and I go and do it. It helps for s couple of months then Iâm back to square one. The amount of hate I have for myself in just ridiculous. I donât think I hate anything even remotely close tot he way I hate myself. 

At my school getting your ring is a big deal. Man I cannot fucking wait to get it either. But after I get it then what? Will it really make me happy?What happens when I finish my degree? Will I be happy then? Will I want more? What happens when I get a job I want? Will that be the turning point? Nothing is enough for me. It just keeps going. Itâs a never ending pursuit of nothing. Fucking nothing. 

Iâm visiting my friends in another state right now. 
Reconnected with an old friend. (Not the one Iâm staying with). Things went well and things kind of flames out. Wasnât good. This year comes around and things actually go through. She was very standoffish though after we were with each other the first night. I thought maybe I did something wrong. She continued to be short with me the next day. Then I went and got hammered for the football game and sent some dumb ass drunk texts and I think Iâve really fucked it up now. She didnât even want to talk to me the next day after.

We are suppose to do something tonight for New Years. However, I feel that wonât go through. I just went a fucked it all up with some stupid drunk texts man. 

I just canât get a win and if I do get a win it helps me out for a month. 

Iâm a hypocrite, a liar, selfish, and just about everything else. Iâm just out here dying and Iâm getting closer everyday to just saying âfuck itâ.

Itâs always a normal day until something small wedges itself in my brain and turns into the storm of anxiety. Weâve been married for a little over two months. 

Itâs time for me to find a job in my new location. I have a degree in Education, but it only took me my last semester to realize how I had made the biggest mistake of my life. When I was in my student teaching, I was teaching seniors (which was bad enough)- but then my mentor teacher bullied me and long story short- I absolutely donât want to teach anymore. I tried my absolute hardest but I guess I wasnât cut out for it. 

The last two years Iâve been substituting. It hasnât been the worst. Itâs an easy enough job. But I donât think I should be doing it. I feel like I need a better career. One I am cut out for. Besides, teachers always make fun of the person who claims to be a âprofessional substituteâ. I feel so depressed when I start looking at jobs. Itâs taxing to try and find something you can do when you donât know what you want to do. Before long into looking, I feel like Iâm just going to vomit. Now Iâm laying in bed- trying not to cry again and writing this Reddit post. This is such a fun way to go into the new year. Helpless and depressed. 

I donât expect anyone to comment and give me any sort of resolve, but I honestly just needed to vent this out because Iâm a pathetic human being.",2,"teacher bullied me, find a job in my new location ,made the biggest mistake of my life, Helpless, pathetic human being"

"I remember the first time I ever had suicidal thoughts, it was 4 years ago and I was living away from home for university. I remember coming home that weekend and breaking down in front of my parents straight away. That experience was horrifying especially because the thoughts were really severe and that was the start of me being depressed.

Now, 4 years later I have periods of severe depression where these thoughts come up again. However, now whenever I get these thoughts I am able to keep them to myself for an extended period of time and just carry on as normal. A major difference between then and now is that I actually want to die now whereas before that thought was completely alien to me. 

My desire to die is pretty strong right now mainly because I am scared about the new year and the last few months have gone really shit. I love my family so much but I feel like my anxiety and depression is going to win very soon. 

I was thinking of going to my old therapist and showing her my diary with all of my suicidal thoughts with the intention of getting hospitalised but that comes across like attention seeking and that I don't really have a desire to die. Part of me doesn't want to go and show it to her but then another part really does. She is the only one I would show this to. 

I am a coward though and don't really have the fearlessness needed to actually commit suicide which is another negative for me. 

Sorry for the long post!

"Hi, 
do any of you have practical advice and methods on how to overcome fear? There are some things I have to do which, when I try to start them, cause me to have this intense freezing fear.  In my case it can be opening various mail or even starting to read some book. It could even be when I decide to rent a movie. I know I shouldnât be afraid and I do not see rational reasons for it, but I get waves of fear that feel like there is a predator that is going to attack. I feel it and I am gripped with stillness and fear as if I am hiding and canât move or breathe heavily because it could reveal my position. 

Because of this I end up not doing things I have to do, missing some deadlines, not going to the dentist. Well the dentist is understandable since no one wants to go to them. In my case it is mundane things.

"Hey all,

Normally I try to muscle through these kinds of things on my own, but I'm having a rough go of things at the moment. Figured I'd make a post about it here and see what input some people have for me. I'm currently a 19 y/o ""sophomore"" in college, approaching what should (in theory) be my last semester at my local school before transferring to a 4-year school next fall. I'm now getting to the back end of my gen-eds, and one of the biggest reasons I went to a community college was to hopefully figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Coming out of high school and just picking a major seemed eternities away from anything I was capable of knowing, so I went the ""play it safe"" route.

I just feel as if I'm approaching a time where a decision needs to be made and I'm seriously bummed out about it right now. I've been all across the map as far as majors/program considerations are concerned, wanting to be a police officer through most of high school---&gt;being an English teacher---&gt;doing something with computers and IT----&gt;wanting to do film? As if now, I'm pretty certain that being a police officer/teacher are no longer of interest to me, but I'm juggling the most between computers and film of all things.

I've seen some older forum posts echoing similar sentiments, but really I'm just paralyzed with fear about making the wrong move. I'm generally pretty proficient with computers, but I have my doubts that I'd be able to keep up with the higher-level math requirements that come along with such a degree. I also wouldn't want to be a software dev or do coding really, and networking sounds boring to me. I just don't know of a sustainable career path that deals with troubleshooting hardware/software.

As far as film goes, I just really like video editing. Would pursue cinematography or something to that effect. With this one in particular I'm really concerned with being able to find work out of college, because so often we hear that these ""fine art"" esque degrees are a big no-no if you want job security and that's really important to me. Film school is also expensive so you have to be pretty grounded in your decision to attend. Despite the fact that I am not really cut out for a STEM related field (I've always performed better in liberal arts classes) I feel like I'd never find work.

This past semester I decided I'd not concern myself with gen-eds as much (only took Bio to get it out of the way) and have the rest be electives. In my case, I took two CIS classes (stands for Computer Information Systems), which were okay, but felt a lot like ""how to use microsoft office"" classes. Not necessarily super representative of the entire field. I even took a career class to get some more insight into potential paths. Helped a little bit but not as much as I envisioned it would.

Sorry for the essay. Bottom line is I just feel like the clock is ticking and I'm feeling seriously depressed and anxious. I can't stop thinking about it. Everyone seems to be finding a path that works for them, grinding out their coursework, while I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks. I feel like I'll never get to where I need to be :(

Thanks for reading this and taking the time to respond, if you decide to. Any and all feedback is seriously appreciated, I'm sure I could use it.

"I've been on antidepressants for around 4 or 5 years, but I'm still a mess. I have no control over my emotions, my panic attacks and general anxiety lead me to ruin friendships and relationships, I have fits of rage that also lead me to say things I don't mean but obviously can't take back, which has made me a very lonely person because no one wants to be around someone like that. I don't blame them. I lost someone that I really really love because of all this shit. It's hard on my parents, it's been hard on the people around me and that's why they leave. I've ruined so many things that I can't fix.

I hate my school. I love what I'm studying but the program at my school for it is a joke. All of the people in my program are annoying, I don't really like them. This past semester though, I started hanging out with them occasionally out of loneliness. That's not a good foundation for friendships.

This past year I've done a lot of growing, I've realized how shitty of a person I am, how selfish I am and how I've ruined every good relationship and friendship in my life. I still have no confidence, I'm still constantly paranoid, I'm always worried about my family members dying or something. I live 400 miles away from my childhood home. I have no friends where I live. My parents don't believe me when I say I have no friends. My mom says ""that's not true,"" and my dad just mocks me. Everything has gotten worse since starting antidepressants. If I hadn't started them, my anxiety and depression wouldn't have become a ""thing"" and everything would have been fine.

So this year, my goal is to get off antidepressants. So I'm going to do that. But where do I go from here? How do I take care of myself? How do I rebuild my life? How do I make friends?

"I am a 20 year old male who has 0 friends, never had a girlfriend, and live with my mom.  I dropped out of high school and have no interest in getting a ged. I have social anxiety, severe depression and anger.  I have been suicidal but I know it doesn't end my pain but just end my life.  I don't see myself doing that but I hate being miserable.  We get 1 life and I would like to enjoy it.  I've been alone, not leaving the house much since I was 14.  I have a lot of built up anger, boredom, and just want to enjoy myself.

Getting a girlfriend is one of my biggest goals, but even then, I feel with all my built up anger and depression, I would be very rude and a terrible boyfriend.

Some health problems I have are:
 I have hives called cholinergic urticaria(my skin becomes EXTREMELY painful when i get hot, or stressed, or whenever a person may sweat) It also affects my legs which are extremely itchy so i can't stand for too long.  There isn't really a cure for it.

things I have done the year of 2017 to help my hives and social anxiety:
I eat healthy, take an antihistamine, and exercise which signficantly helped my hives but they are still there and are creeping back.
For social anxiety I went to a psychologist for months and helped slightly but stopped because it wasn't doing anything.  I take paxil and I went from never leaving the house to going on daily walks, family holidays, and the occasional walk in stores.  I still don't have a driver's liscense.

I am also very depressed, I have social anxiety, and I have A LOT of built up anger.

I have seen psychologists, therapist, etc and it just doesn't help.  Talking about my depression does nothing.  The last psychologist helped by answering some questions involving social interaction but didn't help my depression.  I have taken meds and I am currently taking paxil but I am against using anti-depressants.  I am not embarrased by it, but I feel it is unnatural and possibly dangerous in the long run.  

The reason I am here is asking what type of job/career can I pursue with my social anxiety, hives(won't be able to do any physcial work, standing for long periods of time, a lot of social interaction, etc) I feel the best possible way is to work from home or on the computer.  

I have searched and searched and haven't found anything that would work.

A dream job for me is make youtube videos but that is 1 in a million to make a living as well as I don't think I could be entertaining with my severe depression and anger, and social anxiety.

I feel being able to save up money to move out on my own would significantly help my depression.  I hate living with my mom.  I am good at saving and am very cheap.  A studio apartment if fine with me but it seems wiser to buy a house instead.

"Can't stop the negative thinking about how everything in my life is fucked up beyond repair. Through poor decisions and also situations and circumstances out of my control, I have zero future and no way of changing anything. 

I've become trapped in a cycle of chronic pain and depression/anxiety. It's hard to tell the difference anymore between whether one causes the other or vice versa. 

I can't work because of pain and crippling depression, but I've also been denied Social Security because I've been told that I'm not disabled enough or depressed enough to where I couldn't just shove pills in my mouth and do something--not that I want to be eternally damned to living on a fixed income. 

Things were supposed to be so different. I was on my way to a rewarding career and making damn good money, then everything crumbled, and I literally lost everything. All of my intelligence and good looks didn't do anything for my life against physically disabling conditions and chemical imbalances. 

Now I can't stop the carousel of shitty thoughts that just plays over and over in my head every day. 

I have zero friends anymore, I don't talk to my family, I don't work; honestly, I barely even leave my house. My shitty ex wife has done everything in her power to punish me and alienate me from my children after I could no longer care for them half time anymore after my injuries and spiral downward. 

Now my life is so small. I'm going insane from boredom and isolation and I get full blown panic attacks trying not to think about how everything is so fucked up and how I really can't fix it. 

I have bipolar II, PTSD, OCD, ADHD, and GAD.

My life is a shit show. I just want to run away and never come back but I can't actually run anymore. Lol. And I have no money. And I love my children too much to abandon them. My children keep me alive but also are part of the reason why I am so depressed and anxious about my life. Kind of fucked up in that way. 

I honestly don't know how to handle myself anymore. It's gotten to the point that I will literally just stare at my phone and lay in bed the entire day. I struggle to even put food in my mouth and when I do it's usually only so I can get drunk and not be as hungover.

"I just need to vent and I'm all alone. 

2017 started off as a great year. I had a good job, had a great girlfriend, no debt, bought a new car, had a nice apartment. You name it and I had it. Then it all fell apart. 

I feel so alone, I went from everything one day to absolutely nothing the next. I asked my girlfriend of two years to talk because she has struggled with depression and I felt that she was slipping into a spell so I was trying to help her. Turns out she was miserable and decided that day that we were going to break up and that she was moving out of our apartment that week. She left and I haven't seen or heard from her since.

Then I started drinking and realized how alone I really am. I don't have family, I don't have friends. The one friend I did have I screwed up because of my drinking. I just feel alone.

I got demoted at work. Had to start paying for an apartment meant for two by myself. I just had no one to talk to and I still don't. 

I've tried traveling and that doesn't make me any happier. I've tried going out by myself but I just can't talk to people or make friends. I feel damaged as a person. I feel like I've lost everything that makes me a real person. I can't even meet people. I talk to strangers or people who seem interested in talking to me and we get along well, but as soon as the conversation stops that's it. I've gotten numbers from girls to go out and never hear back from them. I've got numbers from guys to try and meet and hang out to try and be social and I never hear from them either.

I hate my job, I hate the city I live in, I hate how I look, I hate my inability to talk to people, but mainly I hate myself. I ruin everything I touch, I am never enough for anyone, and I am never wanted by anyone. 

I try to keep a pretty positive attitude but each day it gets harder and harder. I can't stand to look at myself, I don't even know who I am. Each day I feel more and more like I am not worth anything, that my life just isn't worth it. I wish each day to just not wake up. Each hour sitting at home in the darkness pushes me closer and closer to actually killing myself. I try to hold on, I try to push myself to see the bright side but I can't. 

My best friend doesn't talk to me, my other closest friend hates me. Every person I know that was friends with my ex and I constantly bring her up and how shes so much happier now. And to top it all off I just found out that she is now engaged. We dated for a bit over two years and it just ended. Just so abruptly. And now 9 months later shes engaged.

It kills me to think about. It physically hurts. I feel like throwing up, I'm an anxious mess; but I have no one to talk to about this. Now I'm sitting alone at work for the new years. No one is wishing me a happy new year, no one is caring that I make it home tonight, no one would even know If I killed myself.

Just when do things get better? I hate feeling worthless, I hate feeling like a burden to everyone around me, I hate being alone. I hate the feeling of not wanting to live anymore but honestly it's the only comforting thought.",2,"demoted at work, feel so alone, started drinking, don't have friends, hate how I look, worthless, burden ,not wanting to live anymore"
"For the past 5 years my New Year's Eves have been nightmares. Each year I get my hopes up to do something fun and I am disappointed. Last year my boyfriend at the time promised me we would plan an awesome New Years in the city. I almost cried I was so happy and excited because I loved him so much, I would get to be that person that got to dress up and have fun and be happy. Wrong. 
He broke up with me Christmas night. Then the next day my grandfather died. Then the whole year sucked after that. Then one of my favorite cats in the world passed away. That hit me hard. Don't judge. 

Now here I am, alone in bed, crying, watching everyone else have fun. I wasn't invited to a single thing by a single person. 

My ex that I'm still in love with has had a new girlfriend for months, that he dotes on and praises and is so happy with. I know they'll post pictures together tomorrow of their New Years together - something I so desperately wanted and never got. He hasn't spoken to me since he met her. Proving I was just worthless shit and she is a complete upgrade that he is happy with.  He doesn't care what happened to me. He got what he wanted - her - he's happy, he's forgotten me. 
And I don't want to hear any tired cliches of ""he's a douche, you have value"",  blah blah. He was only a douche to me because I wasn't what he wanted. He's a perfect boyfriend to the new girl - who is prettier and more fun and more successful than me. I don't mean shit to him, I wasn't good enough for him to put effort into. But she is. And now she's getting everything I wanted.

My friends have forgotten me.
My family doesn't care.
I'm a loser with a shit retail job, can't get a single job with my degree. 
All I have is my cat. 

Taking a handful of sedatives so I can be unconscious as long as possible. I'm not trying to overdose but if it kills me then fine.

No phone, no internet, no contact with the outside world. I was supposed to spend I.t with her at work at least but now Iâm outside, crying my eyes out and wondering if I should just slit my wrist after work.... 2017 was the worst year for me and I donât want to see 2018.... fuck idk why Iâm posting this but Iâm feel so tired and worn and broken.

"hi. 

i had another account somewhere but i forgot the login to it, haha. but that's okay. i just wanted to check in, as a sort of outlet for myself since i don't really get the chance ever to just put my thoughts out there. 

it's the new year. happy 2018, by the way. i hope you all achieve what you wish. i spent the eve alone - by choice. i'm 18 years old, and i'm home on winter break currently from my first semester of college. i haven't really spent time with anybody since being back, though. i have my parents and two older brothers. my parents - we don't necessarily have the best relationship but it's not a bad one either. it's kind of just a mutual understanding of boundaries. i give them what they want and they don't intrude on my personal life kind of deal - you know? and my brothers, they're 11+ years older than i am. and it's not like they don't like spending time with me, it's just...they never really make themselves available for me to reach out.

my oldest brother called me minutes after the clock struck 12 to wish me a happy new year and he asked me what i was doing. and i said nothing, of course and he just told me that i could've called them. which was a nice sentiment in theory but i don't know how to reach out to someone that's never really been reachable. 

i guess right now i'm just feeling lonely. and i've realized that i've been feeling this way for a while now. i don't have anyone to talk to. and the people that i thought i did, my friends, are becoming less my friends and more so people who need/want me by convenience. i don't have anyone. but i guess that's nothing new, i just thought things had changed. and that i was living a better life in college.

speaking of, tuition sucks. when i was still in high school, everyone was just like ""nooo you'll get money to pay for school, don't worry! they practically just give money out for students to go."" or ""apply to scholarships! apply, apply, apply!"" like two opposite ends of the spectrum. but no one really walks you through any sorts of processes that you need to go through in order to pay for college. they kinda just throw it at you. i mean, thankfully i managed to get it sorted out. but too bad i had to figure it out on my own. and eventually, i'll have to pay out all these loans on my own too haha. 

i love going to college, it's fun and i feel like i can be a different person there. a more confident, self-assured one. but if i don't figure out all this money, i won't be able to go. my parents haven't really paid a single lick towards my schooling, but they want me to go to school. my mom even took $500 out of my account to use for something else. i mean, she asked to take it out but who am i to say no to my own mother? 

i'm considering just calling it quits after this next semester and maybe just go to community college for a bit then transfer? work a job at the same time too to save up. but then to me, it'll just be like i put in all that work to get myself into a nice school only to drop out. all my effort. gone. i don't know. it just always seems like there's a wall in my way whenever i just want something for myself. 

i have a lot to do. a lot of decisions to make. a lot of people to please. but a lot of people who will never be satisfied. because what i do is never good enough as i always fall short, even though i put all i have and more for those who need me. 

it would just be nice to know i had someone like that for me, too. ",2,"tuition sucks ,apply to scholarships, to pay out all these loans, feeling lonely,  alone"
"The company i work for is in a moving process so many departements are left vacant or just stuff that isnt picked up yet to the new location.

I just got some bright idea that all the beer around the building werent going to be missed so i took some of it (4 cans all in different departments...) thinking that it wouldnt be missed since they have allready left... And i felt somekind of Â«fuck you mentalityÂ» too them since they were the ones that put me on this shift and never give anything in return... i drank the beers when i got home and dissolved further into my missery till my mom had to throw me into the ER a few days later. Now on sick leave and just got home, i have felt a big regret for stealing the beer... Fuck... I cannot grasp why i even had the thought of doing this and i dont know what to do if they find out!!!  Its just some cheap beer i could easily buy for 10 bucks and now my job can be on the line because of this... idk what to do!!! I feel so ashamed!!!

"I am currently in my friend's restroom breaking down for the last ~30 minutes. Aplogies for the wall of text.

In the eyes of many, I am sure my life is fine. I am moderately attractive with a relatively outgoing personality and decent intelligence. I get lucky with some thing and have the best friend group someone could ask for. Yet despite all this, I still am overwhelemed with depression. To preface, my depression is sometimes caused by outlying causes, but mostly seems to manifest randomly whenever it wants to.

I graduated in 2010 with high expectations from my folks. Nothing too crazy, but significantly better than I performed. With depression and anxiety, I have skipped on many of the opportunities in life (fun, women, careers, etc) and can't seem to truly overcome it entirely. I trick myself into believing it is gone for periods of time, but it inevitably comes back harder than the times previous. I now am sitting in 2018 having accomplished little outside of making a good friend group, and while having gone into business with a close friend, feel like I am the weak partner.

Ultimately my whole life feels like I squandered it and wasted myself when others could've capitalized and lived a happy, fruitful life while my depression and anxiety rules who I am to this day. Frankly, I don't feel deserving of the opportunities I have recieved, regardless of any good I have done. I know it's stupid for someone in my situation to feel this way with so much good in life compared to most others in this subreddit and elsewhere, so i'm sorry.

Hope you all have a good year.",2,"graduated, high expectations, squandered, wasted myself"
"Happy New Year everybody. I've been on Reddit for a while but didn't know this place existed. I've had depression for a few years, but in my case, my depression comes and goes. So I can feel horrible for a whole month but after feel like I'm on top of the world for a bit. One of the sad realizations of 2017 for me is realizing that there are a lot more people who suffer from depression than I thought. I'm starting to build a good support group of friends and family when things get tough, but I haven't felt there are too many groups (to my knowledge) to talk about depression, except here. Are there any sort of discord groups or anything like that that focus on depression? Maybe even YouTubers that talk about their problems with depression. Sometimes depression hits me at the worst times, so there are times where I can't really talk to people for a bit because everyone could be at work or asleep. I think it would be cool to have a place to go to to talk with like minded people that is maybe a little faster than making a reddit post. I hope I can become active in this community as well. Anyway, Happy New Year, everybody.",2,work or asleep
"Thereâs something thatâs been on my chest lately, well, itâs been there for a long time, I just didnât know. 

Iâve been depressed. Iâm not diagnosed, Iâm too scared the doctors will tell me what I already know. Im scared that Iâll have to explain to my parents that their happy, always goes-with-the-flow son is depressed. Iâm scared that my dad, whoâs born in raised in the back woods of Texas, will say itâs not a real condition. Iâm scared that my mother will blame herself for not spending more time with me, or that she could have raised me better. Iâm scared that my siblings wonât be comfortable with the fact that their brother is ill. Iâm scared that my friends will abandon me when they realize Iâm not the stable person I pretend to be. Iâm scared that others would find out and wouldnât want to talk to the depressed kid. Iâm scared that my thoughts will get the better of me one of these days. Iâm scared that it wonât get better. 

Iâve just finished my first semester of college. My lack of will and drive has caused my GPA to straddle the line of academic probation which would lead to me eventually getting kicked out of my dream school. Iâve come to realize just how bad my mental state has been for years now. I was able to move away from home and allowed to really look back on my life and in doing that, I realized something. I couldnât remember the last time I was happy, or the last time I woke up in the morning and wanted to get up, or the last time killing myself wasnât on my mind. I never had many friends so Iâve withheld telling them these things when we talk. In fact, no one know about how I really am inside. Sure Iâll sit there, around other people cracking jokes smiling and laughing, but deep down Iâm not the one really there. Thatâs just one of my many mask I use to hide behind. The real me shakes uncontrollably while interacting with other people. I want to scream and run away if Iâm ever around people for too long. I tell my roommates to go out without me because I canât afford it, when really itâs so I can let my feelings out and sob without worrying about them being around. I donât even know why I cry. I just kind of do. I can be sitting in the middle of a conversation and suddenly get this feeling like Iâm getting sucked inside a deep void inside of myself and all I want to do is bawl. But I canât. That would raise questions and those questions would lead to the real me under my hollow shell. And that really scares me. I donât even know who âIâ am anymore. My personality changes with every person I know. I try to avoid it. Iâll binge watch a show on Netflix, Iâll get lost in the story of a game, Iâll connect with these wacky personalities in anime. But lately, Iâve lost interest. Those shows and games donât work like they used to. Now I just stare at a paused screen for hours because Iâve just detached myself from reality. 

Itâs New Years. But Iâm the same me. New and exciting treads are sure to come and go but I will remain the same. Itâs unlikely that Iâll see next year, but maybe Iâll drag through these 365 days just to see what happens. Who knows. 

I donât blame you if you donât read this. Thereâs no structure, and itâs more or less just getting all of my thoughts out that Iâve kept in for so painfully long. But if you did read it, thank you? Honestly I just want this to be buried. I just felt I had to say these things before I lost my mind. Being a full time actor is exhausting lol. 

Sorry for the formatting, Iâm on mobile. 



I wish you a Happy New Years. ",2,"lack of will and drive has caused my GPA to straddle, getting kicked out of my dream school, stable person I pretend, getting sucked, inside a deep void"
"It's like this: when I can't leave my bed, when I'm crying all the time, when I'm constantly late to work, when I haven't showered in weeks, I can tell myself: these are very clear, objective signs of depression. No wonder you're struggling with everything. Be kind to yourself.

When I'm able to hold a steady job without screwing up, when I can keep in touch with family pretty consistently, when I can clean my apartment: it makes all the things I still struggle with seem to be due to personal failings rather than disorder. So I hate myself.

I can't focus enough to watch a movie or read a book? Well, you can be on the internet for hours, so you're not trying hard enough to focus.

I've completely ghosted most of my friends? Well, you can still contact your family and two of your friends, so you're not really socially anxious; you're just an asshole.

I'm slow to speak and struggle to find words? Your brain is working better than when you were REALLY depressed, so you're a boring person with nothing interesting to say. By the way, you're a lot dumber now because the real depressive episodes ruined a bunch of brain matter.

I feel ""meh"" and numb all the time? You're not trying hard enough to experience new things. You get up to go to work; you should be able to easily get up and take a walk when you have the day off.

"I have been struggling with depression for the past 4 years. I am a freshman in college and am currently the happiest I have been in an extremely long time. I have been dating my girlfriend for 2 months now and I have built many strong friendships at school. I felt like I was finally ready to tell my dad about what I'm going through and why high school was so hrs for me and why it has been nearly impossible for me to mend our relationship.

I believe that one of the leading causes of my depression is the family environment that I spent my high school years in. My dad worked two full time jobs because he wanted to leave corporate America so he started a business. Every day he would come home around 10 extremely stressed and irritable. Because him and my mom wanted the best for me they were extremely strict with their expectations grades. Every night would be screaming while I stared at them blankly telling them what they wanted to hear.

When I think back to 8th grade through junior year, it's nearly impossible to remember anything but yelling. I was scared to tell them that I was depressed because my mom is extremely protective and caring and sweet and she would do everything in her power to help me. But I don't want their help. I've stopped cutting and thoughts of suicide are few and far between.

A couple weeks ago I found out that one of my good friends tried to kill themselves. When I was talking to my dad about it he said that he just didn't understand depression and how someone could have depression but nothing to be depressed about. This made me want to share my thoughts and feelings with him even less.

Something my dad shared with me is what completely changed my outlook on everything . He shared with me that his greatest fear in life was losing his connection with me and our relationship completely withering away. I believed that the only way I could get better is if I shared with him what is going on.

After telling him about my depression a few days ago he told me that if my mom found out she definitely would not let me go back to school so she could keep an eye on me. So I'm not sure what to do with this situation. 

I'm sorry if this post doesn't belong here. I just needed to release everything from my mind and write it down somewhere someone could hopefully see it. Other than my girlfriend I have no one to share with. Thank you for reading.",2,"extremely strict with their expectations grades,it's nearly impossible to remember anything but yelling"
"In the ass and out the eye. This has been one of the most painful and stressful years of my life. Everything that could go wrong, went wrong.

I just want about all the mistakes I made this (last?) year.

1) I took a semester off from college because I failed the semester before that. It was a big mistake that I'll now have to make up for. It strained many family relationships.

2) I didn't reach my fitness goal to finally do a pull-up. In fact, I haven't worked out the entire last month since thanksgiving threw me off my schedule.

3) I attempted suicide.

4) I failed at my attempt.

5) I went back to college and still fucked up, albeit much less so.

6) I barely got to know anyone new.

7) Despite the many compliments I receive at work, I feel they are fake and undeserved. I'm the owners son, and I know I'm a great guy, but I will always have the lingering doubt that people are nice because 'they have to be' and I'll never know who's honest.

8) Despite these compliments I'm still a kissless virgin

9) I'm so goddamn lonely.

10) I'm so lonely. I just want someone to be with.

11) I have plenty of good friends and an amazing, extremely supportive family, but for some reason, I'm still so fucking lonely.

12) I just want the lonely to go.

13) I want someone to hug me without me asking for it. I hate how I have to keep looking for attention.

14) I sent out happy new years to my closest friends and they haven't written shit back to me.

15) I'm really tired.

Alot of good things have happened this year; don't get me wrong. I've come to know a lot people and realized just how supportive my family is. But mentally, I just can't shake off this incredible feeling of worthlessness and loneliness.

"So Iâm pretty much just gliding through the days now. I mean, the entire day just passes by and I have no sense or awareness of the time. It seems like before I know it itâs 5am and time to repeat it over and over again. This has gone on for the past 7 months and has gotten progressively worse over time. 

Iâm not really sure what to do. My financial situation calls for me to stay at home with my two young kids while my fiancÃ© works so most days Iâm just trapped in here staring at the same four walls. My fiancÃ© doesnât understand me when I tell him that everything seems dull and grey. I know I sound like a whiny, sad sack of shit but I feel like Iâm legitimately on the verge of a mental breakdown. 

Is there anyone else in here whoâs gone through this who is also a parent? Or just anyone whoâs gone through this at all? It feels like Iâve lost my identity. I keep trying to remember things that I liked to do before I became a parent but I come up blank. Iâve even lost the ability to have normal social interactions. Like, I used to be very outgoing and pretty talkative but now it seems like when Iâm at a social gathering I canât find anything to talk about for the life of me. Then I end up just coming across really weird and desperate and socially awkward. Iâm tired of everyone telling me âthatâs the mom life and you just have to suck it upâ. It doesnât feel like every other mom or parent is feeling this way. I feel like Iâm drowning.

"Hi everyone. Hope you're all hanging in at this difficult time of the year. 

I've had depression since I was about 13, and I'm still struggling to live with it. I had a really shitty year last year. Both my childhood dogs died over the space of 5 months, I only had a few clients as a freelancer and I lost them after falling into depression through it. Since my second dog died, I've lost 14kg (30lbs) - I now weigh just 50kg (110lbs) and I'm really struggling to find the appetite to put some weight back on. I'm 25, single, unemployed, live with my parents (this is at least somewhat normal in my country), and still don't know what I really want to do with my life in terms of a career. This isn't the first time depression has crushed me and set me back with no glimpse of things getting any better. No job prospects, no friends, no money, but I know I'm not alone and there are so many people going through so many similar things right now that are just desperate to get back on track. While every year has slowly gotten worse for me over the last five, I feel like I've earned some perspective from my depression and the mistakes I've made. Depression is a prison. I might be serving a life sentence, but with good behaviour and some rehabilitation, I might be able to leave on parole. I can't think exactly what lead to my acceptance of this sentence but I've never felt this frame of mind before, and now that I do I think I'm ready to start fighting again.

If you've been struggling for years like me, if you want to change, and you know what changes you want to make... I always find myself giving up and looking towards next year as another opportunity to start again, so just do it for yourself because you realise you need to and not because it's a new year and that's what people do. None of them last because they all watch their friends and colleagues fall off the wagon together. It doesn't work. Remember these people don't care about change the way we do. We can't treat this change as callously as they do. Ordinary people want to improve too, sure, but we *need* to improve.

No dreams or goals. No pull in any direction. It's never changed. I hide my real self from everybody because I'd be labeled the sad guy if I did I make it known.

Like, what's the point of this cycle if all I end up feeling like is horrible and tired every day? I don't want this as a life.

My family don't know me, hell I don't even know me. I've got zero personality or character. Just a empty shell that plays a role.

Life is and has never appeared magical to me. I don't care about anything or anyone and I feel detached from society as a result.

I've done it all. Eaten a great diet, exercised daily, I don't drink or smoke or do drugs and yet my body hates me.

Sick of pretending. Money is everything and you are judged solely on your ability to make more of it.

I wouldn't wish this intense feeling of emptiness and loneliness on anybody. I want out.

I really don't know what to do. I've tried. Therapy, meds.

I hope I don't wake up soon. This life might not be for me.

"Wow, now that's Not how to start 2018. I work an office-type of a job, which has a lot of communication to do with tourists. My job is tied with issuing a lot of invoices. But today, I made about $3,000.00 worth of financial damage to the company. What's even more sad is that me and my boss, which is a great guy btw, we don't really get well along, and today he welcomed me being very happy himself! It was a very happy moment. I'm a kind of an awkward guy when it comes to communication with my boss. My awkwardness comes from severe anxiety I've evolved from childhood, because everyone was treating me bad, even strangers. It makes me happy when my boss approaches me being happy. But today, I had a lot of important invoices to issue, and screwed each and every one of them. My boss was furious. He shouted at me a lot. Now I'm at a point where I think it's either better to kill myself, or ask him to fire me. My sole point is to not have him be angry. If he's happy, I'm happy. I know, this is really weird now that I'm thinking about it. It's the same way with family. Now I'm behind my desk, alone and hoping to be alone until the end of the workday to go home, and either beat myself to sleep, or cry the soul out of me.
Anyways, because it's New Year's, he decided to handle the problems and remain happy. I can't apologise, they are mistakes I cannot un-do. However, after the storm ended, I appear to still feel a crippling depression. At one point I was considering suicide as a proper way to deal with this situation. Hear me out, I don't have a lot in my life. Anytime I try to succeed a plan, I always fail. Only thing I have in my life is my family to care about. I'm the only man in the house, and I'm still very young. Nobody, but me, could take care of my family, and this makes it impossible to travel anywhere. I feel as if I'm critically handicapped towards achieving happiness. It kills me from the inside. Everyday I strive to make myself happy from little things.

"Iâve always had depression, and itâs gotten really bad this year. Itâs affecting every aspect of my life, Iâve pushed most of my friends away, barely been talking to my family, my finances are a mess, and worst of all, my performance at work has gotten really bad. My boss is very hands off, so no one knew how behind I had gotten, what a mess Iâd made of my work. Well last week I got a kidney stone and had to be out several days, and when I was gone they discovered how bad I was doing. Ugh.   
   
Now, Tuesday first thing in the morning I have a meeting with my boss and HER boss called âdiscussion about performanceâ and I think itâs extremely likely I get fired. Even though I find it REALLY hard to talk about, Iâm considering just being totally honest and talking to them about my depression, and how much itâs eacallated this year. Let them know that itâs not just my work that has suffered, but my finances, soicial life, family life, health, everything. Iâm not trying to use it as an excuse, itâs just the truth. I donât know that it will save my job, but at this point I donât know what else to do.

**Future :** Bleak. Specially job-wise. Relationships also have been forced so far, in my sad attempts to be a normal person. Marriage and kids don't look like its happening. In my culture this is undesirable. I'm the weirdo  

**Religion :**  Have to fake it. There is no freedom of religion where I am from. Sometimes normal people things make me feel conflicted.

Funny thing is, I'm the one with faith issues and yet I'm the one feeling guilty even thinking about these things.   

**Mentality :** I can't bring myself to compromise. I can't be happy if I can't make others happy or proud of me. But doing what makes me happy most likely would make people (family mostly) detest me.

"Hello all. Iâm a college freshman home for winter break. Iâm feeling really alone. My old friend group from high school kinda grew away from me as I went to a different high school, so Iâve been seeing plenty of snaps and Facebook posts about them hanging out together and being really close but have never been invited or even reached out to. I was really close to church friends through my junior year but I basically vanished my senior year because my dad left my family, I had to work, and I had to get myself a scholarship to college (which I did). Theyâre all like a big family, and while they include me in stuff, I cannot escape the feeling that Iâm just a guest there, not a member of that family. 
I did get a full ride to William and Mary (Iâm from Florida), which meant I go to school out of state, while most of them going to state schools. Most of them still see each other all the time and are super close, while Iâve had to start over. It kinda hurts to see my college friends hanging out with their friends from home and still being super close to them while I donât really have that luxury.
There is one guy who I think Iâll be friends with the rest of my life. He was my best buddy in high school and weâre still really close. And my girlfriend, who goes to school in DC, is home too so I can see her. Iâm grateful for them but wish I had a bigger friend group from home that I was still close to.
Iâve loved college, but havenât really found a new best friend yet. Iâve still kinda struggled with feeling like an outsider and not really fitting in. I have plenty of surface friends, but I want a close, supportive friend group more than anything in the world, and I hope itâs not too late. Is it?
Can anyone relate to this? Is it weird to not be close with people from high school? How can I get rid of these feelings of loneliness and feeling like Iâm a failure? How can I find what Iâm looking for in college?",2,"ad to work, get myself a scholarship to college, m a failure, really alone"
"Like right now, I just got up. I need to feed my pets, clean the litter box, brush my teeth, start some laundry, and eat something. It feels like too much. I'm so anxious right now, and I just want to go back to bed and shut down. I don't care about today. I don't want it. 

But if I get it all done, I'll probably feel okay. That's not the case every day, but today I feel like I could get to a good place if I try. 

But then what? Tomorrow starts the same way. Too much to do. Everything's too hard and I feel sh!tty. Until I get some things done and the weight is lifted. 

Heck, even two hours from now I'll be in the same boat. There's always stuff to do. I need to clean the house, make some phone calls, shovel snow, get dressed, eat again. It never stops. 

And sometimes I can feel good when I've gotten somewhat on top of things, but what's the point? It's like an endless wild goose chase. Shouldn't I be able to just feel good, regardless of the conditions around me or what's on my to-do list? 

Also, this is just basic stuff. I don't have any kids, relationships to manage, projects or hobbies, and only about 20 hours of work a week. I'm just trying to keep myself and my animals from starving or dying from poverty, filth, or negligence. And it's so hard.

"Well let me very quickly introduce you to my pathetic life.

I'm 23, been in school from Fall 2012 - spring 2017. I started to have serious depression and suicidal thoughts in 2013. I have no friends, never been in a relationship. I've never had a job. Live at home etc etc. I'm a failure. 

I took a semester break in Fall 2017 because my GPA fell pretty low (2.1) and I have no motivation to continue school. I hate it so much. I'm wasting my parent's money. I haven't been doing well in school for a while and have taken less and less courses each semester since 2014. I hate myself for doing this.

So anyways in the fall of 2017 all I could've taken at my uni would be electives because I failed a pre-requisite only offered in summer/spring. The next wave of courses were kinda ""locked"" behind this pre-requisite. It felt meaningless to stack up on electives. My parents let me take the semester off to take some online courses not at a ""real"" university, but more of an online training program. It's alot cheaper than my normal university.

It's like a online thing where you get training from industry professionals in the games industry. During my time at uni I discovered modding and game development and found that I got pretty decent at it. I've been taking it really seriously since 2015. It's my dream to do it professionally one day. Yes, I know that is probably already making you cringe. I've been trying to build up a portfolio for a while and I feel like this is the first year where I've made some real progress. The courses I took where way above my skill level so I wasn't able to get the ""certificate"" but I learned way more and felt more excited about my life than I have in a while. I really think I can get atleast a remote job if I work hard enough this year. I know you can learn alot on your own, and I'm all for that usually. It's honestly been really helpful to get direct feedback from the instructors and I've learned workflows and really specific techniques that I don't feel I couldn't learned on my own. It feels like it gave my life a sense of purpose. 

Anyways, I told my parents I would go back to University after this one semester off but I don't think I can. The thought of going back makes me feel suicidal. Like it honestly feels if I go back I will end up hurting myself. I hate saying that but it feels so true.

Instead I want to spend another semester doing some more of these ""other"" courses I talked about to keep building up my portfolio. Is it a terrible idea to keep pursuing this portfolio thing? (instead of going to proper uni). I'd effectively be dropping out of college. I could always go back though, I'm not on academic probation (yet), and I wouldn't have to reapply for re-admission if I went back in the summer. I feel like it's unlikely I'll ever go back though.

I really want to do it but I think my parents would be incredibly against it. I'm going to talk about it tomorrow with them. If I'm going to sign up for classes at my normal uni I have to do so by Jan. 9. Even just opening up the University website made me start shaking and my breathing got really heavy. I really don't think I can go back.

So, am I an idiot for wanting to take more of these game development courses rather than going to proper university? Is this a terrible idea? I don't know what to do really, I feel like I'm just stuck and going nowhere in life.

"I'm 15 and from the UK, in year 11 in secondary school. I'm male and although probably not gay, probably not exactly straight either. And I'm autistic, self-loathing and fucking stupid.

I've got two (relatively) close friends, let's call them John and Steve. I'm starting to develop feelings for John, which doesn't help my situation at all. Occasionally I play PC games with them, but I haven't recently.

I've also got an old 'friendship' group from a few years ago who I am no longer friends with because they're narcissistic dickheads who were closer to bullies than to actual friends. There are two I despise the most - let's call them Mike and James.

So, over the past year or so John's been mostly hanging around with other friends (who I occasionally talk to however would not consider myself to be friends with) and largely been ignoring me in school. I've tried to ask him to talk to me more but he pretty much ignored me. I've not told him that I have a crush on him yet but that'll probably only worsen it.

That said, occasionally for a week or so he'll start trying to talk to me over his other friends. Surprises me massively, and definitely in a positive way, yet sooner or later he just goes back to his other friends and I'm just another passing person, just another one of the 1000+ people in my school, and he's barely even acknowledging our friendship. What annoys me even more is that when I am in a Discord (voice chat app for those who don't know) call with Steve (or someone else from my school), they'll sometimes add one of John's friends to the call randomly. I'm perfectly fine with this until they say that John's calling them and leave. Why would he call them all of the time and not me? It frustrates me so much.

And then there's Steve, who's decided that he's going to go hang around with Mike and James and their friend group. I tried to talk to him a few days ago on their Discord server. Mike and Steve instead left the server to avoid me, and not long after that I was banned from the server for trying to talk to my friend on it.

So, now I've got my best friend (and crush) ignoring me in favour of other friends of his and going out with other friends, my other close friend just kinda... ignoring me and joining a group of assholes instead.

Yes, I am that guy who stands alone during break/lunch (or recess for Americans), hoping that just one 'friend' will bother talking to me.

I'm not sure speaking to my parents will be a good idea here. They're all much more outgoing and social than I am, and had more friends than me in school, and I don't think they will fully understand how I feel.

I guess I could try opening up to John, but I'm scared it'll just break down the friendship we've had for nearly 2 years (which is a long time for me). He probably still won't want to hang out with me anywhere near as frequently as his other friends, either.

I don't think Steve would understand if I did open up to him, and I can't now anyway as he's decided to block me in favour of Mike. Downright fucking brilliant.

My final option would be to try talking to one of my old friends who isn't a complete cunt to me nowadays. There are a few reasons why I haven't tried to restore my friendship with them, mostly the fact that they're always around complete cunts who they're much closer to than they ever were to me.

My school starts again on Thursday, and I know that I'm probably going to be lonely the entire term. I just need to come to terms with it.

Anyway, I doubt anyone's going to read this, and I feel somehow worse after writing all of this down, but I'm going to force myself to submit this post anyway. Sorry for the post being horribly written as well; I don't want to read it again because it just makes me feel even more shitty.

"In all shortness I just moved and tomorrow at noon I gotta hand in the keys for the old flat, but here I am on the floor in my old flat and have yet to empty all the cupboards in the kitchen and do all the cleaning.

There's at least one large car load worth of things to move and I havent got a car or a license - so cant even rent a car and get it done. First I thought to walk with things (only moved a few blocks), like I have already done two times, but it's notably difficult to do so (and since it's getting late I'm contemplating a taxi. One can use a taxi for this, right?).

I've had months to get this all done but of course here I am having procrastinated like hell and dealt with anxiety by knocking myself out cold to sleep. And since the support system is 99% parents I keep silent about this and dont wanna bother them more than this move already has. So yet again I've put myself in an utterly idiotic position of misery.

Tomorrow comes with work again but I am honestly contemplating calling in sick and dealing with this shit between morning and noon instead of now (been here all day and it is now late evening).

Another sad part is that today has actually been a very productive day compared to what I normally pull off.

And this just sucks. Landing myself in this position sucks, getting myself out of this position sucks. When it's done and over with it will still suck.

"I met my first girlfriend in high school, and I fell hard. She was smart, confident, gutsy, and the first person I felt comfortable talking about my kinks. She did not do anything half-assed, everything she touched she put her energy into. We were both in tech and had startup dreams. She had to run away from an abusive parent, and ended up staying at my place for a time. I thought we had a genuine connection. But she kept comparing me to her other ex, saying that he left her with high standards. Then she started college and first week she dumps me for a startup hotshot, saying she was tired of waiting for me to improve myself. 

So college came around for me, and I hyped myself up. I was going to work hard, play hard, and have a bunch of sex and meet my next girlfriend and future wife. I was going to meet my cofounder and start a cool company. But none of that really happened. Mechanical engineering was tough and ate up most of my socializing/free time. I was in a new city where I knew zero people. I fell into a rut and dropped out.

Additionally, I started thinking my current friends and family were boring, and I started distancing myself from them. In retrospect I was too harsh judging them; nevertheless I still feel disconnected from them.

I know Itâs bad to not compare myself to her, but my imagination still runs wild. I cut out Facebook, Twitter, and blocked her out of my life, but I still cannot stop comparing myself to her. She is smart and got an internship for a big tech company right into college, and was getting featured in the local paper. She got invited to tech events and parties.

Itâs been three years and my self esteem never recovered. I feel Iâve let myself down, not finding a girlfriend and screwing up with engineering. Online dating/hookups didnât work. The sexual frustration sucks. I donât want to waste away my twenties being single. I thought about hurting myself, but after sleeping on it I realize that will do no good. 

Iâm in a mental stalemate: Iâve cut her out of my life, but I still have low self esteem. I see-saw in between being whiny about myself, and angrily wanting to punch every couple in the street. Iâve tried three different therapists to little improvement, and my mopey-ness is straining my relationship with my dad. 

Things are getting better at a glacial pace, but that feeling of failure still clouts my mind. Iâve binged many articles/videos (DFW, Alan Watts, School of Life, etc.), started going to sleep earlier, and started journaling. However, the feeling of failure still affects my day-to-day where I can barely keep my job. I still get discouraged on even the most minor of challenges.

"This new year looks like it might be the year I kill myself. I'm so beyond done now.

I am 26, male, and I feel like my life is over. My family financially ruined me to the point where I feel like I shouldn't even bother trying to fix my life. Due to some circumstances I ended up moving to a town I hate living in, and can barely afford. It's in the american countryside. I hate the american countryside. I deeply hate it. I've never enjoyed myself in the country. I also don't drive, so that makes it suck more. That's just venting though. Some more venting, I've been financially supporting my parents for some years to the point of abuse. I've been saving up to buy a car the last year. 3 times I made it to about 3 grand. 3 times they've taken it, once my took it mom bought herself a car instead. Broke down 2 months later too. then her husband had a heart attack. Then they got themselves an eviction notice. I paid the entirety of their rent the last 2 months. I hate them. But. I can't drive, I have no savings, I am stuck in a place I hate living with people I hate living with and I afford it by working a job I hate and I can't do anything about it because I can't drive and I have no savings, no one will help me drive and my parents keep taking my savings. So it's never going to get better. I have no friends. None. Not a single one. Not for about 3 years. I've disowned my family, aside from my mother but If by some miracle I save some money up and can leave, or she dies without leaving my homeless, then I'm done with her too. So. In my heart I've disowned my family and have no desire to ever contact anyone I share blood with for as long as I live. Which probably isn't very long.

I am completely isolated, very socially awkward, financially a failure. Well. Really I'm mostly just a failure. Like, in every way. I feel like I'm the biggest loser in the world. 

It really bothers me that I didn't do this to myself though. It would be so much better if I did this to myself, cause then I could stop it. Or I could at least take responsibility. I could have power, even if that power ruined my life it'd be mine. But. I go to work and then I basically give all my money to my mother cause she attacks and threatens me otherwise, I have no support system as I have no friends and no one that can and will actually help me, or offer a realistic answer to my problems. People offer shitty advice that has never worked. Staying positive does nothing for me. I can smile all day but It won't get me a car or put money in my pocket. No one I work with is really ""Friend"" material. I feel myself rapidly approaching 30 where ""friends"" become more irrelevant anyway. I feel like I'm going to die alone cause of it. Like, I'll never be allowed to fix up my life and meet someone. I'll never be allowed to save money. I'll never leave the american countryside that I hate living in oh so much. I really doubt I'll ever have sex again, at this point. 

I wake up everyday and the first thing I want to do is cry cause I hate being alive. Like life is a living hell, there's not a single thing about my life that is the way I actually would like. People tell me to take control without realizing I literally have none no matter how much I try, I can't be homeless cause I'd lose my job and there's no room in shelters cause they have to save so much space for women and they're at capacity with regulars. It's also winter, so I'd probably freeze to death in my area if I have to sleep outside. I want to die, but not like that. I also have no where else to go. Literally no where else. Not a single place in the world, as again, I have no friends or family. I have no power. I have no control. 

People offer advice completely ignorant of the fact that I have no resources. I can't leave the house under my own ability, I can't get up and go whenever to wherever. I also have no privacy when leaving the house cause of that. So outside of going to work I don't really leave. I feel like a prisoner. I have no power, I have no resources.

At this point I really think I should just kill myself. I'm rapidly approaching 30, I'm all alone in the world, I have no savings, my personality isn't anything anyone would enjoy at this point. I'm like broken and hollowed out. Just twisted up inside. I'm really no worthy catch in any department, as a friend or more. I often get told I'm handsome though. There's that. It's pretty worthless too. Like, girls I'm attracted too will tell me I'm attractive but my personality sucks too much for it to help. I get looks or fuck me eyes occasionally, no one really talks to me though. I was good with girls when I was younger. But. I had guy friends that would like, invite me along to places to meet women and then they started to kinda bash me and make me look bad. Like, I was bait, and a set up; so they could look good and get laid. So. That stopped. Then I self isolated. Then, I had to move. Then life isolated me. I'm in the middle of nowhere and every attempt at making friends has failed. Even meeting people in general, dating sites in my area don't have very many users. Only enough for like 3 pages in a search on POF. It's boring. I hate it. So, there's not a lot to choose from and it's already gone badly. So I'm alone. All alone. 

All alone, in a town I hate, with people I hate, wasting my time on a job I hate that doesn't actually benefit me cause I can't build up savings. I can't save up to drive. I can't save up to leave. I can't get my mother out of my life. I wake up and feel like crying. I feel like crying all day. I feel like crying now. It's like this every day. It's been like this for years now. So, waiting it out is not an option. This won't pass. It's not stopping. Nothings getting better, it's getting worse and worse. I really just can't anymore.

I think it's just time to go ahead and kill myself. I've really struggled and put in serious effort to fix my life, and it's not happening. I'm sick of assholes with bad advice and I am sick of trying.

I'm done. I am quite literally done, actually. This is the end of me.",2,"family financially ruined me, husband had a heart attack, can't drive, no savings, stuck in a place,hate, financially supporting my parents, point of abuse, have no savings"
"Iâve been working on my 3rd year uni law essays every day for over a month, sitting at the same desk reading the same words writing the same thing on the same screen. I wake up, work, go to bed. I havenât been out or socialised with anyone. It feels like Groundhog Day.

Iâve been having panic attacks every day, feeling depressed all the time because I feel like no matter how hard I try, Iâm going to fail and disappoint everyone, Iâll never get a good job and people will think Iâm a layabout.

The essays are awful, no matter what I do to try and improve them, theyâre just bad, I think Iâm going to fail this year and it will be a waste of thousands of pounds and 3 years of my life. ",2," 3rd year uni law,  wake up, work, go to bed,  panic attacks, fail,  disappoint,  bad,"
"Tomorrow I will be going back to school. I am not looking forward to it in the slightest. To hear where and what my classmates have been doing during christmas and NYE, and having to worry about assignments and such. It's gonna be tough. But on the plus side, it will be my last year. Hopefully after that I get lots of time to try and get better. Maybe sooner if I fail. My grades have plummeted during the last year, but I try to not think about it too much. Chances are that my disability combined with my depression will render me unable to work, and I am very fortunate to live in a country where the disabled get financial aid.

Perhaps the NEET life will give me the time I need to find interests and develop a personality beyond that shy, crippled person with few words to spare. I will also hopefully get a driver's license this year or the next. I don't know what I will do with it, but it feels nice to know that I will be able to drive. I like the idea of driving around just for the sake of it. 

2017 was pretty shitty for me. At least in some areas. I had multiple suicide attempts, but none worked. I also had romantic feelings for someone, and I even had visions for a future with them. A happy future. I haven't had something like that in years. I even paid them a visit to meet in person. It was really exciting to travel abroad to meet an online friend. With that being said, we sort of fell apart shortly after I went home. Most likely a combination of my habit of shutting myself away when depressed, in addition to their depression. Maybe we will meet again sometime. 

I'm not really sure what to think about life anymore. I don't feel much sadness. Not like I used to. Just indifference towards everything. Like I don't care about anything anymore. I should be frightened to think that I tried to end my life. Sad that I split from my romantic interest without even a goodbye. Angry at myself for how I treat myself. But there is nothing. I feel like I've experienced what I need to experience. I've been happy. I've had friends. Moments of intense pain. Anger. Sadness. Depression and isolation. A connection to someone else like no other. I am satisfied.

I can die now. ",2,"back to school, not looking, gonna be tough, multiple suicide attempts, shutting myself away, intense pain, Anger, can die now"
"19 male America. I am in a worse place than ever before and not entirely sure of who or where I am so please excuse any nonsensical bits or typos. To put it simply enough, every thought, person, and location feels bizarre and unreal and detached and profoundly difficult and overwhelming. I feel like an alien life form who has been suddenly thrown into a human life and body, even though I've had 19 years of this existence. Or maybe I feel like nothing at all in an empty vessel others take for a human. Maybe that's a better way of putting it. I have been severely depressed and anxious as long as I can remember (I tried to throw myself in front of a car when I was 7), but this feeling is new. Am I dissociating? This morning (5 PM actually, morning for me) my dad, who I really like and respect and who has been as supportive as possible for me, came to wake me and I literally forgot for a moment who he was, who I was, and where I was. Although I had been invited to a party, I had spent New Year's Eve the night before alone, crying and thinking about death and viscerally shocking myself every moment, realizing I still existed. To get back to the point of this rant, the most basic things like material objects and gravity and other people feel apart from me and almost sinister. I dropped out of high school, got a GED, and failed or stopped attending two community college classes, all the while sporadically working three different jobs all of which I was fired from or quit after about two months. I've been talking to a few girls who seem very interested in me, but whenever it comes time to seal the deal or set a date, I just... don't. I don't know why. I'm just so tired of it all and I can't begin to imagine decades more of this life without having a panic attack. Last night I began writing my suicide note even without any particular plan in mind, but it felt cathartic, realer than anything I've experienced in years. I think I'd use sleeping pills. Other than that, music, which I listen to all the time, is my only anchor. Usually I only begin to feel alive when contemplating my death. At least I have control over that, and my memory would be viewed with rose tinted glasses, better than anything I could ever actually be. This post will probably be paid no attention because that's just how life goes for me, and that's not bait for attention. Whatever. At least I could put my thoughts down.",2,"dropped out of high school, got a GED, failed, worse place, dissociating, writing my suicide, cathartic, alone, crying"
"Been having on and off waves of depression since 10th grade and just a total, consistent lack of motivation to put effort into anything. I dropped out of collage after the first semester and now I just work to keep myself afloat mentally. I just don't care enough about anything to get myself moving forward. All my relationships fail because I'm just not emotional and block everything out. New Year's Eve drank myself unconscious and now I'm back to my depressed self and self harming again. I hate myself for not being able to get though it and I'm afraid my life will just be passive and grey.

My friends have always neglected and judged me, but there is nowhere else to go, and in a high school environment, I donât want to be that âlonely kid pretending he didnât exist during recessâ.

"Hey everyone! Quick little backstory: I am 22 years old and have suffered from depression since I was around age 14. During that time I took Zoloft with a Xanax PRN for panic attacks. Earlier this year (around May 2017) my primary doctor upped my dosage by 50mg, I was then taking 150mg. My body adjusted to the increase and I hated how it made me feel. I felt worse than before. As if it worsened my symptoms. So, full well knowing the dangers of stopping a medication like Zoloft, I stopped taking it around the end of July 2017. 

At first I was fine. Them a month had gone by and I was bad. Then a few months later (Nov 2017) I was the worst I had ever been in my life. I lost 20lbs from Thanksgiving to now... I don't have an appetite, even though I feel hungry all the time. I have extreme fatigue. I am always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I am stressed because student loans kick in this month ($515 a month), and I cannot afford to visit my family doctor because of $ I owe from previous visits. 

Is this 20lb sudden weight loss something that can be attributed to depression? I am generally a very healthy person. I workout daily, but haven't been able to the past month because of my extreme fatigue and depression. That's why it confuses me as to why I've lost weight. 

I am 22, female, athletic build, 6'0"" and 178lbs.

I have other issues but that's the main one. it first started in the middle of my freshman year, I'm now a junior. Because of it my doctors have removed me from any school and I'm to tired to do most things. This has made it as if I have been frozen in time while the rest of world continues forward without me. At first this was heartbreaking and I went through depression, however during that time I always thought that my emotions were not nearly as strong as a normal person's would be in this situation. Since then I have stoped being depressed but have also stopped feeling emotion towards my situation completely, both positive, negative and even neutral emotions, I just don't feel. I have also started finding it very difficult if not downright impossible to feel empathy towards others, or any other emotion for that matter and I have been left with only  logical reasoning -when I have the energy to properly think- to an extent.

"Lately I've been panicking over the realization that I'm dumb as a brick, and I haven't achieved anything in my life. 

I'm 20 years old and just got my first girlfriend. I guess this is the only major achievement of my life, as she is beautiful and smart. Amazed we actually connected. I constantly have a feeling she's going to leave me due to the fact I can't keep up with her. She has achieved so much. Scholarships, awards, friends, and more. 

I did nothing in my life. My teen years were spent playing videogames. I did anything and everything I could to waste time and make my life go by faster, because I assumed I'd be happier when I got older. Unfortunately I've realized that I should have used that time to train my brain and focus on grades/academic achievements. 

Now I'm as dumb as a brick. I have no career direction. I don't think I'd ever be able to work in a field that makes serious money. I still don't have any friends other than one online friend, and my girlfriend ( who has many real life friends ). I've never had any real life friends. 

I don't know what to do. My brain is already fucked. My memory is so bad. I feel like I've lost the ability to learn.  Once she realized I'm destined for failure, she's going to leave me.

Come off from a well off family. I could not work a single day in my life and live comfortably, or run our family business and easily earn 400k/yr.

And at the time I had a friend who also self harmed but neither one of us knew the other did it. My parents were good friends with the schools principal and he told them this which immediately led to them blaming her for corrupting me basically and no matter how many times I told them this wasnât true they wouldnât listen. So weâre in the hospital and my parents told the doctors this and I could tell they immediately took me/my case less serious and after a series of vague question (usually what are your grades, how clean is your room etc ) the doctor told my parents I was faking it for attention. I was put into therapy and starting out I had three therapists but over the course of a year I worked my way down to one. At the end of that year the last one was kicked off of my case. But throughout that year I still self harmed and have off and on ever since. Well now to the point ig, my mum has always told me that she cares/loves me but has done nothing to try and help me (outside of that therapy which she constantly told me was useless) I have gotten caught self harming multiple times but have never been taken to the hospital since the first time, I have told her that I feel suicidal and have been struggling with the urge to not hurt myself and I asked if I could go back to therapy. That was a month ago and she hasnât said anything about it or even asked how I was doing. Then today I slept late because I didnt fall asleep until 7am and she was yelling at me for being lazy then told me that Iâm depressed because Iâm always sleeping or in my room, and then told someone else that when she didnât know I could hear her.

I am seeker g attention because I have exhausted all other forms of communication calling the hotlines and I canât confide in anyone because I risk losing my job. I just want to voice my feelings because I feel like if I donât I will like explode or something. I am just sad. A sadness so deep it just debilitates me. I want to end and yet I donât. I feel like itâs not right and I should just wait and see if anything positive happens. But I have been saying the same thing to myself for years now. I still donât feel any different, just more poised for a quick removal. I wish it was that easy. I donât want friends. I donât want to be close to family. I just want to be ended. I want to lie in a beach somewhere and have my lifeless body carried out to sea and everyone to eventually wonder âI guess he ran off to Mexico. Good for him .â  This is neither here nor there. I donât know. No, I donât need comments because I am not killing myself.m tonight or tomorrow. I am sure other OPs need more help than I and these feelings are invalidated. Fuck me.

"21 (M) with severe anxiety | mild depression (probably more than I admit). 

After graduating high school I did 2 years of generals in college. I didn't get my associates but I know that I'm really close and need to get that finished up. 

Before summer semester of 2016 I dropped all my classes because I hit a wall of depression, also couldn't see the Major I was in working out, and I couldn't pick a new one. I didn't want to waste money aimlessly taking classes with expensive tuition. I am currently on a leave of absence until November when I will have to begin paying my loans back if I'm not enrolled in any courses. 

Financial Standings: March of 2017 I got a full time job (40 hours a week) making $8.50/h I got a raise and will start making $10/h this pay period and my boss said that I'll get a $1 raise in the springtime. I live with my parents and they don't accept any money so 0 expenses on that front (I try not to take it for granted, I'm really grateful to them). I have a car payment of $150/month, but I plan on paying it off by March (~$3000 left). Also car insurance is about $150 a month.. I currently have ~$2000 saved up but I owe at LEAST $10k in student loans. 

I'm super demotivated and bored, nothing interests me career wise... Or at all really, I don't have many friends to hang out with, used to waste life playing video games but they're such a drag that I get bored in like 15 minutes.. I just don't know what to do at all except keep grinding my dead end job while sleeping in my parents basement. 

I guess this is just my Year-End Review... and I don't know what I'm doing...

"My life isn't getting better, albeit I'm very young I really just dream of a point in the future that things are just working out in my favor for once. I hear about people hitting their rock bottoms and finally making a change that leads them to a much better version of themselves. I imagine myself progressively doing worse and worse things until I reach my rock bottom. That scares me because I have been doing worse and worse things and I don't want to hit that rock bottom anytime soon, I just want to change.",2,"life isn't getting better, progressively doing worse"
"Hey Iâve been depressed for almost 3 years now and in the process of doing so Iâve failed almost all of my college classes and am being dismissed. I can barely get out of bed, shower, eat, take meds, etc. My only saving grace as a human is that I still work full time.

Any advice anyone can give me? Or encouragement? Or literally anything Iâm so empty inside I donât even want to help myself anymore. I feel so self destructive.

"I need help. My mom said that I used to be happy, just for the sake of being happy. I can't even remember when that was. Every time I try to talk about my issues, I end up asking the same questions over and over, borderline asking people to shower me with complements and reminders of my good qualities. My mother is annoyed to no end by this. I don't want to do the same to my friends. As stated in the title, I have lost the will to live. The timing couldn't be worse, as I'm about to start talking classes for my GED, which I will need to talk because I fucked up in high school by being lazy and not doing my homework. I don't necessarily want to commit suicide, but I feel as though I am ""at peace"". I don't care if I'm going to die anymore. Maybe at most I'll shed a tear and ask to say goodbye. But, I am not at peace, for if I were, I wouldn't have such feelings of my own insecurities and self loathing. I don't know what to do to feel better, as every time I am even the slightest bit happy, it always goes away too soon, and I miss that feeling greatly. The biggest worry right now, is my borderline nihilism, the possibility that nothing matters; there is no point. I am unsure at best about whether or not this philosophy is true. I hope dearly that it's not.",2,"fucked up in high school, borderline nihilism, insecurities, self loathing"

"In the last month I spent my birthday, Christmas, and new year entirely alone. I likely failed at least one of my exams. Almost every night I've woken up in fear from a nightmare in which my only friend dies.

Two months ago was the last time I went into work and the last time I went to most of my classes. I told everyone I was too busy, but the truth is I was too anxious to leave my apartment. It felt too much like I was just failing.

Three months ago is when I discovered that my depression may be caused by a chronic vitamin deficiency, which I would have been suffering from for over 10 years without knowing. A disorder that could have equally significant impact on my brain and body, which it may have already.

This month I'm going to get checked to see if I'm right. If I am, then my dream career is a bust. If I'm wrong, I'm right back to square one and most likely going to end it. I'm in a lose-lose situation.

The only thing keeping me going anymore is the fact that I don't know how my friend would handle it. She has big dreams that she can absolutely attain, but if she cares about me even a fraction as much as I care about her then coping with my death could ruin everything. Yet at the same  time my presence in her life has been a fairly consistent cause of stress. Another lose-lose.

"I was doing fine for some time and I thought that I could start 2018 with a better outlook, but yesterday I got into a car accident and my car got towed. It's my fourth accident but my first time that I was at fault. I have a speeding ticket too that I need to go to court for in a few weeks.

When I got home, my parents yelled at me. I went into my room at 5pm and didn't get out for dinner (hadn't eaten breakfast or lunch either). I was lying there for some time, thinking about all the mistakes I've made in the last few years. Getting an F in a class, spilling water on my laptop, cracking the screen on my phone 5 times, opening up a credit card and putting myself in $2500 debt, getting an STD after having sex with a guy who was in a relationship, drinking even though it's forbidden in religion. I have also been fighting depression since last August, because I started a graduate program with no social support and all my college friends moved away. I had an appendectomy in September. I was applying to medical schools; the application process was anxiety filled and one of the scariest things I've had to go through. I got rejected by most schools and waitlisted by a few.

While lying in bed, thinking about all of the shitty things I've done in my lifetime, I remembered I have a hook that's in the corner of my room. I had asked for the hook a few years ago so that I could get an indoor hanging chair or hanging pottery but never got around to it. I also have a chair in my room. For a good hour, I seriously thought about hanging myself. Why should I continue to live if I just keep making mistakes over and over again, and disappoint my parents constantly? Why should I bother to see this year through, when it's already off to such a shitty start?

Right now, it's 3am and i'm doing a little better after sleeping it off. I got out of bed, made myself some food, and eating Ben n Jerry's to numb the pain. I'm reminding myself that a new year is NOT a clean slate, and that I won't magically become a better person or magically stop being depressed. I need to put the work and effort into bettering my life.

-or because I'm dying and wouldn't be as upset then the first option.... yikes. ",2,nothing physiologically wrong
"I think itâs safe to say that Iâve been depressed for as long as I can remember. Unfortunately I never thought of depression as a possibility for me so I always debunked these shitty feelings and sadness as âjust a bad streakâ.

When I came to terms with myself and realized I had a problem, it took me a long time to open up to someone and reach out to them. I opened up to my girlfriend at the time. Fuck me was that a terrible decision.

At first she was mostly supportive but as time went on I was âtoo negativeâ or âboringâ or ânever satisfiedâ. It was almost like she completely disregarded everything I told her. It pretty much became her being mad that I was depressed.

We hit a rough patch late in my senior year and it only added onto my self hate, my stress, my anxiety, my sadness. I felt everything at once and then I felt nothing. That night I decided I would kill myself only to be unsuccessful.

She and I talked things through and when I eventually told her what happened, she didnât just put me down,  no. She called me a liar. The relationship didnât last much longer than that but of course when I left I was told that âI should have tried harderâ.

Itâs been half a year since I left her and I have no regrets or wishes to have her back in my life, but fuck me I hate her. I hate her so much. I hate that she was the one I opened up to. Because of the experience I had with her, J am hateful to most people nowadays.

Every day I wake up absolutely loathing the fact that I will have people to interact with. My new friendships and acquaintances are short lived because I get so agitated I leave. Iâve only come to learn that nobody gives a fuck about depression

Not a single person could be bothered that I want to kill myself or fantasize about how great it would be if I got in a fatal accident. Thereâs nothing but pretenders in this world that will use my death as a mean to promote themselves as a good person. I can only see myself writing a scathing note about just how much I hate everyone before I die. 

Whenever I do that, I can only hope that it hurts everyone so fucking bad. Hurt them like they hurt me

"Hello everyone,

I'm a long time lurker on this sub. Like I mentioned in the title, my life has been nothing but a mess for the last 4 years. I failed university in my last semester and never managed to finish my degree in 2013 and the entire 2014. I started working in 2015 but by early 2016 I self-sabotaged myself out of a stable job due to depression from a break up with my then girlfriend of 5 years. 

I have been living like a parasite for the last 2 years - living with my parents without paying anything. My self-esteem at the moment is so low I was about to delete this very post just because I felt bad typing all of that out.

Nights after nights I go to sleep asking myself - what do I even live for? Helpless, frustrating, disappointing, sad, angry and sometimes suicidal are probably what you'd use to describe my inner thought in recent years. 

I don't know if any of you experience this but in my mind there's this voice that constantly talks down to me. ""You're a useless piece of shit"" is probably the number one thing that it keep reminding me. I never tell my parents that I'm depressed. Or that I failed uni. Or that I had a girlfriend and broke up with her after 5 years. I lied to them when they tried to talk to me about those things. I just couldn't help it. At this point that voice in my head is probably my only friend.

I don't even know if anyone cares at this point. I'm just rambling and writing random things that probably don't make any sense. But I want to get it out somehow. I decided to not delete this post after all. 

So yeah, just want to talk about my random miserable life on the Internet with strangers for god know why. If you guys have any thing to share about your life as well I will be here reading. Probably.

"Decided to go to my new primary care doctor in order to get a referral for my acute sleep apnea problem Iâve had since childhood. Decided because this was the first time seeing a doctor in several years, maybe I should get what is supposed to be an annual checkup(blood test, ekg, etc.). The first thing the doctor asked me was âare you feeling down lately? Are you depressed?â



I kind of shrugged and laughed âehh I donât think soâ. She smile and told me it was all part of the checkup.


I told her I wasnât feeling down, but Iâm not too sure about my answer which is why Iâm here. Iâm going to try my best to provide all symptoms and events in order for you guys to get some idea of what Iâm going through.



Letâs start off with the doctor visit. Out of the blue, I started walking outside again; in the dead of winter no less. I liked to blame my tendencies to stay locked up at home on my laziness, but now I find myself taking a stroll around my neighborhood every once in a while. I never really thought I was a full blown hikikomori as Iâve maintained a job for a short period where I had to interact with customers.,. I live in a very busy part of New York so there are many faces to look at and imagine where theyâre all headed.


I recently applied for college as a returning student for the spring semester which is why I think it may just be anxiety or even college-mid life crisis because I am doubting my career path.



I need to prep for some of the classes as I have forgotten a lot f the materials.. itâs been a good year since Iâve gone to college. I know I should be studying, but I seem to be pushing the schedule back. I even planned out my schedule on my calendar app, but I end up just deleting the notifications and telling myself that Iâd do it tomorrow. I hate this part about myself because I feel this is what led me to fall so behind in school. Everyone of my peers whoâve Iâve cut contact with have already graduated and live a decent life, meanwhile Iâve quit my job as a store clerk months ago and donât know where the time went.




Activities? I stopped gaming but many people get into a period of malaise with this. I seem fill most of my day on reddit and watching shows when Iâm not walking around outside.





 I move around the house aimlessly; idk what the deal with that is. I find myself walking into the kitchen and forgetting why I went there. I think Iâm just watching what I eat. Iâve lost a couple of pounds which is great.



My sleep schedule is screwed but I am not forcing myself to say in bed longer than I have to. I actually hate laying down with nothing but my thoughts because my mind drifts into odd places that make me sad. I wonder what wouldâve happened if my mother didnât have issues with the first child. That would mean I would have never been born; my parents had me because the first one didnât take.


Anyway I think about shit like that so I like to minimize my time laying in bed with nothing else but my thoughts so I end up watching shows on my tablet til I fall asleep. 


Iâve also never been good with sleeping near electronic devices since I was a kid. Just bad habits I think.


I havenât attempted or even fantasized about leaving here so I guess thatâs good. I have written an apology letter to my parents though and Iâm scared to know what the intent of that was.




Well I hope itâs not depression because Iâm about to get on a medication that has a known side effect that can potentially amplify the sadness. This might be a mess to read through.",2,"fall so behind in school, quit my job, gaming"

When you look into the abyss

And the abyss looks into you,

Penetrating, objective,

He analyzes your insides

and devours your name.


----------------------------


But sometimes, only sometimes,

when you look into the abyss,

He ignores you, threes not even silence.

And nothing happens at all.


----------------------------


You would give all to the abyss,

just to get devoured by him,

Annihilation is all you ave left,

but even the abyss doesn't care about you.


----------------------------


Desperate, you cry:

âWho am I?â

Please, I just want to hear a voice.

It does not matter if it is true or not,

I just need an answer,

because that would mean I am something,

to someone.



----------------------------
However, the only thing you can hear,

is the silence in past conversations.

----------------------------


You cry, and emptiness conquers you,

the beauty of your words no longer matters,

if not even the abyss hears them.

----------------------------


Everything looks so simple, 

filling my emptiness would be so simpleâ¦


----------------------------

I just need to be answered,

be something to someone,

be mentioned, praised or even insulted,

But be called.

----------------------------


Only then,

When even the abyss abandoned me,

I discovered the formula to smile again.


----------------------------

And you feel the taste of a tear,

that has slipped into your tongue,

Cached by a smile.

"I've recently been going to the doctor for problems with sleeping. I have bouts of insomnia, wake up feeling like I've barely slept regardless of if I've had a decent amount of sleep and feel tired through the day. I did all the tests my doctor could possibly think of and I'm perfectly healthy. When we first started my doctor asked if I felt depressed and I dismissed it because I feel the same as always. 

Now I'm starting to wonder if it's mental rather than physical. It's been like this for a long time, sometimes better, sometimes worse. 

I looked back through a few logs I kept of how I felt when I was so tired I could barely get up to go to work, and I would often write things about feeling disconnected. I haven't thought about it for awhile, but it's still there. It's not strong or oppressive or anything like that, just sort of a general sense of being in a dream, things flow past me and nothing really matters. People stop mattering, I stop caring about stuff I love, that kind of thing. 

So I'm starting to think that maybe I am depressed, but I have a habit of self diagnosing and scaring myself. I didn't really think about it before, since I don't feel 'sad'. But it all sounds like, at the very least, there's something mental going on that's making everything messy. Maybe it's just stress? I don't know.

I think I might look into it more, talk to my doctor about it, that sort of thing. Im at the point where I don't really care what it is that's wrong, I'm just sick of feeling this way and at the very least if I know what's going on then maybe i can do something about it. 

If anyone read this I could use an opinion (I won't take it as gospel but it'd help), some support or even just tell me where to go if this isn't the right place. I don't mind either way, I think it's good to just vent sometimes to think things through.

I'm decently in shape and used to be a bodybuilder but that kind of slipped away. I'm a smart person, always in the top 15% of whatever academic class. Great parents that support me. It all started going downhill when I went to grad school but realized it was a dead end and started getting depressed. Later I learned that most people get depressed in grad school because it's such a shitty prospect. It has been 1.5 years since I decided to dropout from a PhD and I'm still fucking livid about how shitty it was. Like I can't move my life past it. Now my job is mostly boring and easy but pays way better.

Now here I am 2 years later and still depressed. It's just like I am watching my life fall apart in front of my very eyes unable to do anything about it. But that's the thing, I have it so good that I can't even let my life fall apart. One person told me I couldn't fail if I tried and it's like I'm trying to prove him wrong. It's like I'm trying to fail but I just can't. And I think that contributes to the helpless feeling. At the heart of my depression is just the hopelessness and lack of control that kills me. I want to feel like I'm in some sort of control over my life but it feels like no matter what I do, hard work, lazy, focus on this or that, it just feels like it doesn't matter either way. That takes all of the fun out of life for me. It feels like life turned from a choose-your-own-adventure to a roller coaster ride with a fixed track. No way to get off the ride, just have to take the shit that comes along. I'm slowly giving up all the passions I used to have because I'm either not good enough or I'm worse at stuff than I used to be. I long to be like the 21 year old version of myself. I was so happy then.

But I'm so confused because right now I live with a guy who is fat, eats unhealthy, doesn't have many friends, is annoying, no college degree, never moved out of this area. Just generally a nerd with little social skills. But he seems to be happy. And I'm so confused. How can I have so much more going for me but be miserable? I just want this to end. I want to just be satisfied and happy with my life but I can't find anything that will scratch that itch. I'm just existing and the only thing I'm looking forward to is getting a dog, retiring early, and getting married. Those are pretty cool things, but it just feels like brain is so fucked that I won't be able to enjoy it. I smoke weed (not all the time) to cope and it helps, but really just delays these feelings like I'm having now. Fuck.",2,"started going downhill when I went to grad school but realized it was a dead end and started getting depressed ,decided to dropout from a PhD"
"Iâve posted a couple times on here the last week about how my depression has gotten a lot worse and itâs effected my job performance. I had a meeting this morning at 8am to discuss it. Well, they said I could either resign or they would start termination procedures.  
  
Iâd never talked to them about my depression, and how itâs ruining every part of my life, not just work. I tried my best to explain it and how it was effecting me (when I could pull myself together). They were very kind and understanding, but it didnât change anything. They donât want me there. They sent me home to think about it, and theyâre having an HR rep call me later to discuss my options.  
  
I worked for a hospital, so theyâre also having Behavioral (mental) Health call me as well. I donât know what Iâll do now, thereâs just nothing Iâm smart enough to do. This is starting to look like rock bottom.",2,"effected my job performance, had a meeting this morning at 8am to discuss it,they said I could either resign or they would start termination procedures"
"Not really hahaha ... i fucking hate myself... to be honest , i don't know why i became depressed. I always feel sad and lethargic. I always have no motivation. I am always so shy and very anxious. I can't even speak properly to anyone who are not close to me. Reporting in front of the class is always a nightmare, I always get very nervous and always forget the things i'm supposed to say. I also don't  know what I wanted to be. Choosing course on college made me cry for 2 years because of the fear of being on the wrong path. I'm not yet in college though but it feels like that i am already on the wrong track. I always don't know what to do because I don't like to do anything. Everything is boring... I want to kill myself but can't do it because I know that it's not the best way to face my problems... but what should i do? I feel like I am just forcing myself to be alive.",2,"Reporting in front of the class is always a nightmare, always get very nervous and always forget the things i'm supposed to say, not yet in college though but it feels like that i am already on the wrong track"
"I hope this is the right place to post this... Itâs now 2018, but I donât feel like itâs a fresh start at all. I hate most aspects of my life and Iâve been getting steadily more depressed since I started middle school, and Iâm a senior in college now. I started having more genuine thoughts of suicide lately and yesterday spent an hour last night researching methods for attempting. I donât want to talk to anyone around me, because itâs pointless and makes things worse. Counseling at school didnât help me and just ate up more of my time and worsened my problems in school. My parents wouldnât understand because their mentality is that if I have any problems, itâs because Iâm lazy not depressed, so I canât discuss anything with them. I feel trapped, because Iâve had dreams and goals from childhood that I just canât see happening anymore because of what my parents are forcing me to do and my physical health is declining too, leaving me feeling weak and physically insecure all of the time. I donât know how to fix any of this, and I just want peace. Iâm tired of feeling pain and exhaustion all the time and being punished for underperforming as a result. I hate that none of my goals for life worked, and no matter how much being under the pressure of my parents has ruined my life, theyâll still be angry with me without considering or caring that Iâm mentally and physically broken and never even wanted this. I donât see the use in continuing such a stupid routine where I breakdown so often and am trapped. Even if I fail, Iâd be happier being locked up in some mental hospital than staying in my current situation. I want to be done.",2,"started middle school, and Iâm a senior in college now, hate most aspects of my life "

I'm 18 years old and a freshman in college. I've had mental health issues for a while, but it has really worsened since about August of this year. I was actually having a pretty good summer, I travelled in Europe with my best friend, saw a cousin who lives in Germany and had a fun week in Paris. It was exciting and really nice. I miss those days. It feels like forever ago. I started feeling weird about a week after I got back. I kept sleeping and sleeping, so much sleep, but I was never rested... I felt tired all the time and always had a headache. My thoughts were really morbid and weird. I kept thinking about my own death, my cat's death, my parents' death... they recently turned 50, they hopefully have many years left of healthy life, but I'm scared to lose them. I started thinking about how life is so temporary and we're moving rapidly along a path toward that inevitable end, each day closer to a painful illness and death... and endless nothingness after that.
So I started college in September. I'm minoring in philosophy, and I'm taking this course called Ancient Philosophy. The professor is great. But the thing is, philosophy and astronomy are the two topics that really get me into these disturbing existential thoughts. We're reading a lot about death, and I wrote this paper about Epicurus' views on death (he is the one who said ""death is nothing to us""). I found it interesting. I realized that I somehow long for death (most of my problems arise from consciousness, and I find it very appealing to just go to sleep forever and never wake up, because I find the most comfort in sleep and am always disappointed to find myself waking up to another lousy day on earth). At the same time, the idea of ""eternal nothingness"" really creeps me out, probably because I can't imagine it and because consciousness is all I have ever known. I missed a lot of class and was late a lot this semester because I just didn't... see the point, I guess. Of doing anything. I thought about killing myself just to get it over with. I know how I'd do it and everything. I really think I will kill myself someday. I honestly am about 75% sure that my life will end in suicide; not any time soon, but eventually. I actually like the idea of suicide. In a way, I am pro-suicide for myself (I would never encourage anyone else to do this, but it's their choice). I find the idea of dying by suicide empowering because something inevitable and daunting is now put into my hands, and I control my own death as well as my own life. I told a friend this once, needless to say my friend was not amused and got worried. I don't talk to anyone about it now, they shouldn't have to worry about me, I just wonder if my thoughts are really abnormal psychologically or if that's rational (it seems rational to me, and it seems like people just think it's ""crazy"" because of the prevailing view in society that suicide is always both immoral and irrational).
I can't really talk to my parents about this. They don't believe in mental illness. I'm from a Syrian Druze family, but they're very secular and don't care about religion... and I've always found religion to be just a way of getting out of actually evaluating the world and confronting the absurdity of life. And I sort of have a negative view of it because of the destruction that fundamentalism has brought to a lot of people, it's close to the experience of people where I'm from, all for an irrational idea. At the same time I have always been a bit jealous of people who have religion to rely on. Like some of my Muslim friends or ones who are very Christian. They know God is there for them. I don't have anyone or anything. I don't know if I'm depressed. I definitely have been, but at the moment I'm fairly active, but my thoughts are never on what I'm doing, they're always on these existential problems and I'm almost always feeling despair and hopelessness, even when I'm acting social and trying to have a good time.
I sometimes feel that the world is not real, and worry that it will disappear at any moment. It feels that I am in a dream. I cannot define myself and others always seem like strangers, no matter how close a relationship we may have. Everything seems absurd to me. People I know from school and from my job are always are sighing about essays, exams, homework, work. To me it seems so strange. It seems like people act as though we are not mortal. They don't act like they are aware they will die. In the supermarket or something, I feel an urge to remind everyone ""We are temporary! We will not always exist!"" (Of course, I don't).
My life circumstances aren't bad, I've had some difficult things, like I lost a few family members and a friend from childhood. But overall, I should be grateful. My family has money, I've never had to face poverty. My parents love me, but don't understand me. I love them, but don't relate to them. I hope I don't seem ungrateful. I don't understand why I am how I am.

"I am sorry for the rant, I just feel the need to get this out. 

Today I had to stay home from work because I am too stressed and sad. Last night I had a mini meltdown and tried to just leave and go to a hotel , but my husband was able to talk me out of it. I didn't have a plan, I just wanted to get away from everything and have one night away from it all.  I have trouble sleeping at night because work stresses me out so much. I applied for other jobs and already got those rejection letters in the mail which only made me feel even worse.  I feel trapped in a job and a life that I hate. I just can't seem to get happy. I have an amazing husband, a good family,  a decent paying job, I see a therapist, but nothing seems to work or make me happy. I feel like a passenger in my own life. Like an extra in a movie. Sometimes I feel like it wouldn't't even matter if I were gone because I don't even feel like I am here anyway. I feel so detached.  I know I am depressed, and I am trying, but feel like I am being beaten down to the point where I just don't want to try anymore.  I'm tired. I am so tired of trying only to fail.",2," work stresses me out so much, have trouble sleeping at night, applied for other jobs and already got those rejection letters in the mail which only made me feel even worse"
"Cannot believe I am here. I am entirely unprepared for the future I never wanted. I am not suited to bear the burden of existence, the ebb and flow of life which inevitably contains suffering. Life is a beautiful golden package containing pure cyanide . Life is an atomic bomb decorated with glitter. To whom can I return this ""gift""? Where will I find my home? It's unreachable. Not even the hands which were once warm and comforting can accommodate me now. In death I find comfort, an unparalleled feeling of Liberation. Like Hal [Infinite Jest] I find myself at a crossroads between the desire to pursue a better life and the desire to succumb to my addiction entirely. Really, my desire is to escape. I am seeking an El Dorado which doesn't exist. All I want is the life of a hedonist without the repercussions, the drugs and sex minus the consequences. But in reality drugs are a destructive force (not to mention illegal) and nobody I would have sex with wants anything to do with me (understandable). I feel like a prisoner to life, trapped here against my will without the means to escape. I don't want a job, I want to be able to live without needing to sustain myself. I wish I were attractive enough to convince a child free lesbian millionaire to marry me. That way I could live a life of luxury, opulence and self indulgence, and while it certainly wouldn't be fulfilling, it would be better than this.  My soul is tainting the Earth and the Earth is tainting my soul. It's a reciprocal cycle of madness. I am unsuited to life and there is really only this issue at the bottom of everything. It is the mother. Mother. That horrible word, that vile, putrid thing. I do not hate my own mother. I simply resent her decision to give birth to me and the laws which enabled it to occur.  I wish euthanasia was legal for depressed individuals. Wretched sons of bitches, forcing me to live a life I resent.. and for what? So I can be another miserable wage slave. ",2,entirely unprepared for the future I never wanted
"So Iâve always been a reserved introverted person by nature and this had not been a problem even when I got to College. I would wake up, go to class, say a few hellos here and there and then go back to my dorm. Little did I know of people and how they actually worked and little did I even know of myself. Anyway fast forward a few times into the future, I met some people who I guess for the first time in my life, I wanted to be friends with. Now, Iâm a guy who readily smiles and is polite etc and I guess something deep down inside of me really wanted to impress these folks (especially since I had no friends at the time). This I now know is a result of low self esteem but Iâll come back to that. So we all decided to room together the following year and I admittedly was excited, seeing as I had only stayed by myself or with strangers before. This is where my self esteem comes into play. We signed up for apartments (3 bedrooms). The first room which was the largest was actually picked and moved in, it remained the two other rooms. 

Now these two rooms were built differently, one of which had the bathroom inside (B room) and the other had the bathroom on the outside and was smaller a bit (C room). I made a costly mistake when I actually picked the B room and signed the lease to pay for it, only for me to offer it/exchange it (while still paying for it!). Knowing who I am, I thought this was gesture of friendship or something but looking back now, this was an incredibly stupid and naive decision. 

As the semester wore on, I went from regret to sadness to depressed and just could not live with myself nor could I let go of that mistake. I began to question everything, what made me come to that decision? How could I have been so naive? No one does that. Realizing that it was low self esteem even made it worse. I began making bad decisions after bad decisions. I found myself saying yes to things I didnât want to do, I was suffering inside. I withdrew into myself and went from reserved to just plain silent when in groups especially with these people because I could sense how stupid they thought I was. This wore on me so heavily that it affected my academics and my overall view on life and people. Iâve hated myself a bit because everyday I pass that room or get the bill, it just reinforces these beliefs. 

It may sound dramatic but its true. The lease will be up in 4 months or so and I canât wait to leave. I have also learned a lot from staying with these folks and from this entire experience even though its been a nightmare. Iâm having a hard time finding myself again and although its a new year, Iâll be going back to school soon and will soon meet them again. I have tried over the break to strengthen myself again and not go down the same route of trying to commit to things I donât want to do etc this time but Iâm not sure. 

How would you have done it?

I have been having some things happen to me which I think might be related to depression. The only thing is that I am not sad and donât have self confidence problems either, but have some other things which sound like depression.

I have noticed or been told things about myself recently that I donât feel are consistent with me in the past. My feelings are dulled, I talk in somewhat of a monotone (people tell me, I canât hear it), and sometimes I donât make any facial expressions so people think that I donât like them when I really do. Often I will be in a social environment and people will say my name to pull me out of a kind of thoughtless trance where I stare off into the distance with a blank mind, I never remember it starting, just being pulled out of it by someone else. I sometimes get asked if I am high when I am stone cold sober.

I have also been having some weird thoughts, like to jump off of a balcony to my death, or violent ones like to stab someone with a knife I am holding or to crash my car on purpose. (I donât want to do either of these things, I will just get a thought like âdo it, stab them in the neckâ or something) I would like to emphasize that I am not suicidal or even unhappy at all. Sometimes I look in the mirror and something looks off about me that I canât put my finger on, I look like someone else. Also different people often ask me âare you ok?â This bugs me because I am always ok, do I have a weird look on my face or something? I never hear them ask other people that, what is wrong with me, it makes me think that I am mentally challenged or something and everyone has been told except for me. There might be more stuff but I canât remember.

All of this stuff has happened in the past year, maybe because of stress? I am a 19 year old male, moved away to college this year so big life change but these things were happening before then also. Help/suggestions much appreciated.


TLDR: I think something is changed with me

"I'm warning you, this is gonna be a looooong ass post. This will probably get lost in this sub but there are a few things I really need to get off my chest. Also, I'm not a native speaker so baer with me :D 


2017 was by far the worst year of my life but also kinda the best, because I was finally strong enough to make some changes. A little backstory: I've always been pretty insecure and shy, never had a lot of friends and was pretty quite. Then, I got into a relationship with my now ex boyfriend. He has issues. Anxiety, depression and unfortunately a couple more mental health issues. I've never had to deal with something like this in my life but I loved him and was willing to help him as much as I could. Things were fine in the beginning, even though it was super hard for me. I had to make a lot of sacrifices. He was not comfortable traveling, so I tried to accept it as good as I could, even though I always wanted to travel and see the world. He didn't want to spend time with my family. He dodged every family event, every birthday and didn't even want to have lunch/dinner together with my parents. He said he felt uncomfortable around them, so I did not force it on him. But it didn't stop there. I was not allowed to get tattoos or piercings, even though he knew that this was something I've always wanted. After a few years his mental health got worse. He also has anger management issues and started to get more aggressive. We started fighting..a lot. I started to become unhappy and this is when everything went downwards. Since he didn't want to leave the house, we ate a lot of junk food. We just had it delivered or picked it up, went into my room (I was still living with my parents) and ate by ourselves. Needless to say, I've gained a lot of weight during our 8 year relationship. 


I started to distance myself from all of my friends, right to the point where I didn't have any. I distanced myself from my family and pretty much everyone around me. I was alone, but I still had him and that was the most important thing at that moment. We had more and more fights and I started to see a different side of him. He was super manipulative and made me feel guilty, even though it wasn't my fault. He twisted my words to make me look like the bad person and he started insulting me. Calling me a the biggest bitch on earth, a manipulative psychopath and a worthless piece of shit. I didn't know what to do anymore. I became more and more unhappy and - after a few years - depressed. This led to me eating even more, because I was so frustrated so I gained even more weight, which made me even more unhappy. I still stayed with him. Thinking that he would change once we move out (as I said, I stayed with my parents and he pretty much lived there with me). As I was still in school and he had no job, I could only wait for me to finish school, him to find a decent job he could keep, so we can move in together. At that time, I also blamed my parents for being unhappy. No real privacy was possible in our house because my parents always wanted to know everything. They were pretty much always up in my business. Anyway, he kept telling me, that things would get better once we have our own place. I believed him, or let's say, I wanted to believe him so bad. But things got worse. We fought pretty much every day and he started to not only insult me but also pointing out my insecurities and telling me, that no other guy will ever want to be with me, a fat and ugly psychopath. He knew exactly what to say to break me. He did this for several years, while I endured everything my mental health got so bad, that I started to harm myself. I felt absolute worthless. There was nobody I could talk to and I was too broken to do anything. I was stuck in this shitty relationship and couldn't see a way out. I did think about suicide but was always to scared of doing it. 


I dropped out of college and was looking for a job for 1 year. I was on the verge of giving up. I didn't see any point in continuing this ""life"". I never thought I would let someone ruin my life, who was supposed to love and support me. Then, I finally got a job and made some friends at work. I actually really enjoyed going to work and seeing them, hanging out with them and being normal. The more time I spent with my co-workers, the more I thought about my relationship and that I needed to do something. Over the course of 2 years, I tried to break up with my boyfriend pretty much every month. He kept promising to change and constantly told me that I'm the only thing that keeps him alive and if I would really leave him, he would kill himself. He wants me to know that it would be my fault and he would make sure that I would never forget this. I felt like I had no other choice but to stay with him, even if it would destroy me. Fast forward to 2017, one of my co-workers (who has mental health issues himself), became my best friend and helped me through a really fucked up time. He was always there for me, whenever my boyfriend decided to throw a tantrum and blame me. I got to a point, where I almost packed my shit and left for good. I just wanted to leave and be alone. The depression and panic attacks were destroying me slowly. 


After a while, I started to develop feelings for my co-worker and he told me, that he has feelings for me as well. No, I didn't cheat on my then-boyfriend but it hit me ""there are still guys out there, that would want to get to know me, who think I'm pretty and want to treat me with respect"". I finally decided to end my relationship. It took me 4 months. 4 long months full of panic attacks, threats, tears and suicide thoughts to make it but I did it. I'm not gonna lie, it was an on-again, off-again thing with my ex for these couple of months and again, he tried again to manipulate me into taking him back and giving him another chance. I felt SO incredibly guilty for leaving him. I blamed myself for everything that went wrong in my life. We still texted sometimes, because I tried to remain friends but I knew it didn't work. I tried it because of him, hoping it would help him with the break up. Silly idea, I know. After telling him one last time, that I cannot be in a relationship with him anymore he sent me a long message, telling me that I've ruined his life, that I deserved all the bad things that happened to me and that he will find someone better and prettier than me and will make sure that I will never forget what I've done to him. He kept insulting me, like always, but this was the finale straw. I blocked him everywhere. He tried to contact me again a couple of times, sending me e-mails and shit, but I ignored them and sent them straight to spam. I cut him out of my life completely.


Up until September, I really didn't see a point and I hit rock bottom. There were times I couldn't leave my bed because this freaking depression paralyzed me. I was scared that I was going to lose my job. I mean, my life was already a mess so why not add unemployment to it. I was done, with everything and everyone. But luckily, I had some amazing friends and my family and they've helped me so much. After finally opening up to my sister about what had happened with my mental health in the past 8 years, she was shocked and told me, that she wished she knew it sooner, so she could help me get out of the relationship. After so many years of feeling worthless and thinking that nobody cared about me, I didn't know how to react to this much love and support. It was a long and incredibly difficult way but I started to hang out with my friends more often, talk to my family and in general, tried to spent more time with them, after ignoring them for 8 years. I kept thinking about the past years and how much I've missed out because of my relationship and my depression. So I finally decided to put myself first. I started to work out, eat healthier and lose weight. I got my first piercing and even though it might not be anything special, it was something special for me. It was the first decision I made on my fucking own and for myself, and only myself. After that I got my first tattoo and 3 weeks ago, I moved into my own place. All of this would have not been possible, if I didn't have the amazing support from my friends and family. 


I'm not gonna lie, I'm still not okay but I'm a lot better. I still have super shitty days and panic attacks but nowhere near as often as I used to have them. I want to be happy again. I want to enjoy life and in order to do that, I will start therapy soon. Thinking about the last year makes me so angry, sad but also happy. After so many years of psychological torture, I was finally strong enough to put a stop to it and open up to my family and get help. I have so many things to do and so many places I want to see. For the first time in years I'm actually looking forward to the future.

His article Anatomy of Melancholy (http://andrewsolomon.com/articles/anatomy-of-melancholy/)  he wrote in 1999 for The New Yorker in which he talks about his own personal battles with depression have made him a huge advocate for depression and is very informative.

"A bit of background: I've been struggling for 5 years with severe depression and I'm currently in my 3rd year of college. My main drive in life has been to eventually get a job over-seas (mainly anything involving national security or humanitarian aide) to help people around the world however I can. Currently studying Political Science with a minor on International Relations and have plans to continue through law-school. 

Thing is, I'm getting really restless along the way. I have a future job in mind that only requires a bachelor's degree but I'm afraid that a degree on Political Science won't really get me anywhere in the long run so I should have a law degree to back it up just in case things don't go as planned.

I've also considered going on student exchanges but due to economic problems in my family, we've had to prioritize our expenses on other necessities. I live in Puerto Rico so we've also had to deal with the aftermath of hurricane Maria; university's been delayed for months so any chances for internships clashed with the semester's new schedule. Due to all of this, I haven't been able to fulfill that desire to travel.

I feel like there's so much going on around the world and the fact that I'm stuck for a couple more years buried in lectures is killing my motivation. I've tried to distract myself through different hobbies, volunteer work and going out with friends but nothing's genuinely helping.

Don't wanna drop out of college at all but I'm finding the road ahead really tedious. I'd like to hear how any of you have dealt with a similar kind of rut and how I could maybe find that drive again to not let my grades go down cause of my depression.

Thanks for reading and happy new year

"I like to leave comment replies in this comments in this Subreddit but I don't Submit Text Posts here much. I thought I should write about how I'm doing since I feel like a great success story. Since it's the beginning of 2018, I'll reflect on 2017 as compared to 2016.

I've been seeing a therapist which has been helpful. I've been more thorough about my negative symptoms to my psychiatrist which has allowed me to feel really great about the medicines I'm prescribed.

2017 was better than 2016 for me in every way. I found a new job. I made a ton of new friends. I've taken tons more photos. I've threw several more parties this year with many more guests attending. I traveled three times in 2017, which is a lot for me. I attended way more fun events in 2017 than in 2016. I volunteered more. I ate better. I went to bed much earlier and woke up much earlier. I got many more chores done. I did a lot more reading. I've taken better care of my friends and family. I'm eating much healthier. My body looks way better. I've been going on more dates and more ""successful"" dates. I'm wasting way less money. I clean the place where I'm living way more.

I played computer games and watched TV and read the news (including Reddit) way less. Anything that doesn't feel like it's helping me take good care of myself is a distraction, and distractions were like poison to my depressed self.

I went from wanting to die to thinking life is pointless to loving life and wanting to take great care of myself every minute of it. I'm spending way more time doing things instead of thinking to myself about things.

"This is my first post here, so please be kind.

I am facing the following situation: 10 exams in January (Masters degree level), and a very bleak and uncertain future after that. (No, you don't get a job or internship or whatever even w/ a Masters degree, when you are as much of a loser as I am). Here's the thing though: I have been struggling with depression for a long, long time. It comes and goes in episodes. I noticed that taking the contraceptive pill Yasmin exacerbates my depression. I started taking the pill a year ago, went off it for a couple of months in the autumn, and now I had to start taking it again because my nightmarish hormonal acne started coming back.  My cheeks look like the surface of the moon ffs (just for the record, I'm 25, never had acne as a teenager; it hit me at the age of 22. Now I have both pimples AND wrinkles. yey.) I have tried everything else but Yasmin was the only thing that got me rid of the cysts. I won't stop again. As you can imagine, having a bad, cystical acne AGAIN would make me twice as depressed. With regards to the antidepressants,  I did take Cipralex last autumn but it didn't help really; if anything, it made me feel even more suicidal.

So, future is grim, but I have to push through, sadly. I am giving life one final chance - 2018 will be do or die (literally) -  cos I've taken far too many Ls so far and I am just sick and tired. If I don't get my shit together by December 31st, it's game over. 

Do you have any advice on how to proceed and make it through January? I am looking for some pill or whatever to sort of numb any emotional thoughts/feelings I have and to reduce the frequency of my nervous meltdowns and crying, while at the same time doesn't sap me completely. I need some energy to learn that stupid shit that is required for the exams.

"Hi guys, long time reader first time poster here.

A year ago I moved into an apartment in a brand new city. I remember being so excited for all the things I'd be able to do. I'd get a job, get to a gym membership, and even join a few social groups.

Well, after a year, nothings really changed. I applied for a lot of jobs and ended up going to a decent number of interviews. Nothing ever came of them and after June passed me by I lost my nerve to even really look anymore.
     I did end up getting a gym membership but I've never really used it though. I know I shouldn't procrastinate like this but I'm never able to find the energy.
     I haven't been able to find any groups or friends while I've been here either. I've looked but the only groups I've been able to find have been smaller groups that cater to people a lot older than I am. 

It's been getting harder and harder to find motivation to get out of bed or go outside for a long time now. As I don't have a car, I'd have to take the bus to go anywhere which would eat up most of my day. I haven't really been able to derive any sense or pleasure from much anything these days. I'm just letting the time pass.

Next week, I'm starting university and I'd like to enjoy this time of my life.

"so iâm 16, a junior in high school. my whole life iâve struggled with confidence in my abilities. i doubt myself a lot and iâm aware of it, but i canât seem to stop doing it. 
but like anyone else my age, i have my permit and i get my license in 6 months.  however, i donât like to drive. i havenât driven since the week after i got my permit, 6 months ago. iâm not scared iâm going to get in an accident or hurt somebody or anything like that. when i did my 6 hours to get my permit i was actually told i was a better driver than most. but i have this issue where iâm terrified of what others will think of me if i fuck up. something small like doing a shitty job when i change lanes or something scares me into not wanting to drive at all bc i donât want anyone to think less of me. i know thatâs stupid and not a reason i shouldnât drive but that fear consumes me in my everyday life. 
i promised my dad iâd start driving after the new year, and i plan to uphold that, maybe itâs just a hump i have to get over. weâll see. but with getting my license in 6 months, that also means that i gotta be able to pay for gas money. which means i have to get a job. 
so iâve tried to get a job before. quit after the first day. i didnât like my position, the place itself, or the people. it was a general store that sold sandwiches and drinks and stuff like that. i was the cashier, and being a quiet person that didnât work for me. the owner kind of humiliated me by making me repeatedly use the intercom system to call out peoples sandwich orders, saying iâm âtoo quietâ and yeah, correct me once and iâll fix it, no big deal, but donât make me do it over and over, that just put me down. and then my friend who works there told me a few days later how the owners and some of the employees were making fun of me about how i was quiet and that i wasnât saying thank you to the customers for their business. like yeah, iâm sorry i didnât do that, thatâs my fault, but it was my first day, i was stressed the fuck out, cut me some slack. the owners also scared me away with their whole âyou have to uphold this expectation to the customers because our store has been here for over 75 yearsâ, and yes i would expect your worker to be nice to customers and have good hospitality but donât throw that at me and say that. it just scared me and turned me away. 
long story short, my first job experience kind of was crap and it made me not want to do it anymore. i donât want people to criticize me or look at me in a negative way. it just put a bad taste in my mouth. 
so driving and getting a job are my struggles right now, but i have to do them i guess, im just terrified for reasons that i shouldnât be worried about. but i donât know how to get over my fears.",2,"a junior in high school,my whole life iâve struggled with confidence in my abilities, i doubt myself a lot and iâm aware of it, but i canât seem to stop doing it"

I am filled with stress and my whole body itches from bug bites and hives and psoriasis and dry skin. i have rly bad toothaches and migraines and fevers. My heart hurts all the time and pounds in my chest for no reason whenever Iâve eaten food. I am so dehydrated and sick and depressed and yet I am trying to do my best. I donât know why I am writing this tbh. I have a lot of trauma and problems w my head too. I have extreme anxiety and whenever I go anywhere a bit far away from where I live I get really anxious bc I think my body is going to give up on me. I start getting really overwhelmed with noice if thereâs a lot of different noice or loud noises (they make me jump in intense shock) I just get so overwhelmed and horribly anxious and my sift gets blurry and my heart starts hurting. Itâs like a stabbing pain. I once even went to the hospital bc it kept going for so long and I thought I was having a stroke. Three times my anxiety has been so bad and Iâve been in a stressful situation and my whole body just shut down and I laid in bed for days unable to walk. I couldnât move my legs bc they were paralyzed. It was horrible and all of these health problems make me feel so weak and again just....overwhelmed. I have so many problems that I constantly run around trying to take care of all of them all the time and it just wears me out so much. I have gotten so tired. So fucking tired. I am too lazy to talk about more things that are wrong and also it seems useless. I am trying but I am really tired.

"Been dealing with depression and anxiety for the last few years. Tried to live life normally when Iâm outside my room. Friends didnât even know I had it cause I tried the hardest to not let it affect my everyday life, even though I go through lots of anxiety attacks throughout the day. Yesterday, I just needed one break from work, first time to ever do that and was told I needed to âtoughen upâ. Felt really bad about it. All these years Iâve been dealing with my anxiety and depression without letting it affect my work ever, and now that i just needed a day off, I get that message.",2,"just needed one break from work, first time to ever do that,was told I needed to âtoughen up"

I actually can drive and willing to but, the freaking state jerks me around. Because oh... You went to a mental hospital for two weeks from being suicidal when you were 16! That was almost 4 years ago and, it brings me down. They tell me that I need to be medically evaluated but, I can't get a drive to get medically evaluated when everything is 30-40 miles away.

I'm not going to ram a car into a person when I start driving, chill out. I would call a taxi/uber but, since I am so damn far away from everything that would cost probably around 50-100 dollars per trip. :/",2,can't get a drive to get medically evaluated when everything is 30-40 miles away

Iâm not special, the world doesnât revolve around me. I exist but my existence is not as meaningful as I thought. I realized so many things about myself this last year. Iâm not as smart as I thought I was. Iâm not important to anybody. I have nothing to offer to the world. Itâs just a hard realization I came to. I was never meant to do anything but work a dead end job living paycheck to paycheck. I set a date for when Iâm going to die. Itâs the only thing I feel like I have control over, but even then I donât know if I can hold on for a few more years. Iâm struggling to find anything that will give me purpose to be here. Iâm alive but every day is the same and all I want is purpose. Just any reason to keep going. The world is beautiful and there are so many reasons to not give up, but I canât find any right now.

I spend my time playing video games and watching youtube videos. I frequently ask myself what would happen if my parents kicked me out, if I truly was alone and had to fend for myself. Am I just a spoiled lazy kid, or is what I'm claiming real. I DO feel shitty sometimes, but I'm in a sort of hibernation the rest of the time if that makes any sense. I DO remember having real issues with anxiety, finding it incredibly hard to talk to people at times but right now it doesn't really feel like anything. I have a couple of really good friends but I don't really like hanging out with them anymore. I've just sort of accepted where I'm at right now.  I've talked to my friends about depression but even though they could relate and have issues of their own, I feel like they're still going forward with life. I want to know for sure that I'm not just making shit up and what I feel is real but I'm not sleeping 19 hours a day, I'm not a junkie and I haven't attempted suicide. I want to get better and I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now but I'm really afraid that I might just be a prick.

"I often go to bed at 3-4am and wake up at 12-2pm. I know this is terrible, probably unhealthy, and also when I have to wake up early (for appointments and things) itâs the worst. 

And it doesnât help that when I am trying to sleep, itâs hard because Iâm plagued by thoughts about needing a job, not putting enough work into school, what people think of me, thatâs to impossible to be with that girl I like because all I know about her is from twitter, how Iâm a terrible creepy stalker weirdo for crushing on some random person on twitter, you know, the usual stuff.

But when Iâm in bed after 12, and Iâm watching a movie, or playing a game, or whatever, itâs the only time I can REALLY relax. 

Iâm currently a college student, so this schedule works for the most part. There are lectures and things I have to attend, but those are often later in the day so it works out. 

I live with my big family, (Iâm an introvert, as if that wasnât obvious.) and while yes, Iâm able to do things by myself or alone, it still feels... I donât know, not as relaxing? Itâs like Iâm half relaxing, but the other half isnât.

Again my familyâs big, and most of them are loud. Iâm a quiet anti-social shut in, so naturally I spend a lot of time at my desk where my desktop is.... and pretty much everything else. This is setup in the most popular room in the house, so even if Iâm doing something by myself and alone, 95% of the time thereâs *atleast* one other person in the room.

Like I said, they can be loud, playing games, talking to online friends (jealous), and younger kids running around and playing. My two little brothers (both under 11. For reference I am 20) adore me, which is great, I love them too.... but the problem is that means they love to come a visit me, talk to me, play in the same room as me, etc.

It just feels like I never can relax... until everyone else is in bed, and I can do whatever I want and not have to worry about anything. 

**Itâs like living is my job, and when I get into bed is when I finally get off work.**

My therapist is telling me ways that I can get my sleep schedule to be more normal, so that way I can have more time in the day, but I was thinking about it and... why would I want that? I never feel fully comfortable in the day, and late at night is when I can finally just forget about everything. So why would I want to take that away? Iâm mean sure Iâll get a lot more done, but if I have to sacrifice the only time I can fully relax, is it worth it? ",2,"not putting enough work into school, what people think of me"

"For the past like two years now Iâve been depressed with on and off suicidal thoughts which sucks ass man, but lately around mid 2017 I started to just become numb and not even care about shit. My grades have t always been great, but itâs freshman year and i already failed first semester of algebra, almost failing like one or two more classes, and have to retake algebra in the summer. I donât know if I can do it man. Everyone says Iâm smart and Iâm not actually depressed and donât have ADD when Iâve talked to them so many times. I do actually have ADD and am pretty damn sure after having heavy depressive symptoms for over two years Iâd start to notice Iâm actually depressed. No one takes a 15 year old kid seriously. Sure, I ride bmx which is like the only thing I live for (and photography), and Iâm a funny guy too. Most people even say Iâm pretty attractive, like a 9/10. Iâve only had one official girlfriend, and two other girls Iâve had a thing with. I do know that multiple girls like me, and one of my female friends even said she liked me before, and still does, so do I, but I think we both agree on just being friends. I honestly donât think it would be the best thing to do to try and become more than friends. Sheâs probably my best friend, and vice versa, and one of the only people I feel comfortable talking to about my shit, along with one other really good female friend. The thing is though, I havenât been able to talk to them since my parents took my phone a couple weeks back before break, and now during break I havenât been able to have it or talk to anyone, or hang out. Iâm not complaining or anything, I think no phone for now is actually good to take it easy on electronics and become more outgoing, trying to become involved in people and nature, or just other things than texting and playing games all day. Although Iâve been filling my time with anime most of the day, and I have wrestling practice almost every day for two hours which keeps me really toned and healthy which is good. Iâm just tired man, I donât even know why I just wish I wasnât existing. Now Iâm just rambling shit.

"Good Evening, everyone. I landed a job interview tomorrow. It's my first job interview since I got fired from my old job and checked into a mental institution/rehab February 2017. I've been clean and sober since the 23rd of February, and got on a mixture of different antidepressants (Lexapro, Mirtazapine, Seroquel). I'm anxious as hell and I feel like I'll fuck this up. I really hope not. The starting pay is a little higher than my old job and I actually get benefits with this new opportunity. Hell, even the work hours are great. I just can't shake the feeling I'll fuck up. I really don't want to fuck it up. I feel like my medication has been helping for the most part, but shit. I still can't get the idea that I'm a fucking hopeless drug addict out of my head. That I don't  fucking deserve a second chance at doing something in my life.

"I'm sure that most people already understand this, but I keep falling back into the same shithole that's depression. The worst part of it is, I still doubt my condition, despite being told several times. Maybe it's because of my extremely young age? Not only that, I still feel I have no right to be depressed. I don't feel obligated to feel sad because I have almost everything good for me. 

I'm a lazy slob with no sense of responsibility or alarm.

At least that's the name I've settled on for now.

Currently, my friends are all sharing remorse over one of their girlfriends getting in trouble for being gay (but that's an entire different story that I won't go into) and I haven't said a thing (we share a group chat online). It's not that I don't care, it's just that I'm scared that my depression will make me sound selfish. I don't want to tell them I'm depressed because it'll likely make me sound selfish. 

Either way, I can't really win right now.

I've been holding back my feeling from them for such a long time (we've all vented to each other except for me as of now) and I don't know how long I can take it.

With that in the way, I've just been left alone, left to be the shut-in I am. 

It's already so difficult to carry a conversation with social anxiety.

I only find comfort online or in virtual/fantasy worlds so all I do is play video games.

I used to be so passionate in drawing because it made me happy, but lately it has been months since my last drawing. 

I'm a disappointment to my parents.

I cost so much money.

I do nothing to benefit anyone.

I feel as if I'm some add-on that you can remove, and everything would still function properly.

"I'm just lying here wondering what the point is of living. I'm not actively suicidal, but I feel like life isn't worth it *at all.*

A brief run down of my life:

I'm a graduate student. I've sunk 80k into my current career path, for a total of 120k in loans. I have one semester left to complete and I should be looking forward to it but I'm dreading it instead. I've lost my passion for my field and I know I'm drowning in debt. I'll make around 45k a year when I graduate so I'll be in debt until I'm 52. I feel like I have thrown my life away. I worked really, really hard for 8 years in college and it wasn't worth it.

I am 25lbs over weight, the most I've ever weighed in my life. I hate my body and myself for letting my body get this way. 

I have several chronic medical conditions including fibromyalgia. Life is literally pain for me. Physical pain.

Nothing I do makes me feel anything but sadness. I'll be doing my absolute favorite things and be fighting back tears the whole time.

All I can think about it how I'm going to have to struggle the rest of my life and it'll never get better. I won't make enough money to even take vacation or live in a nice place. I'll have to work really hard, more than healthy people, to just keep my job so I can just pay my debts and never have anything nice or any rest. And I'll be in pain the entire time until I can finally just die after a long, disgustingly hard life of struggle. The End.",2,"graduate student.

"Iâm just laying in bed with tears rolling down after waking up from a long nap. My thoughts are scattered so bear with me. I feel pressure in my chest. I have work deadlines and shit I should have done over the holidays. It was an easy work day though since I left early to get a tooth fixed that Iâve neglected for more than a decade. I didnât see the point in getting it fixed though - my dentist made me. Itâs a waste of time and effort on me. I went home after and had a 4 hr nap ... and woke up disoriented in the dark before it hit me that Iâm still alive in this life I hate. I always find myself in this place thinking and fantasizing about the end, no matter how my day went. My day could have been amazing and I still ending up thinking about the best way to die.   
I have help- I have a family, a wonderful psychiatrist, a good job. I had a lot of love to give but in the end I just donât want to live.

""Stop crying, at least you get paid. You should be grateful for those hours and all that money you made"".

Dress the part, smile and Kiss ass at a job that you hate in hopes for a promotion, 4 years go by and that door still hasn't opened. I hate it. I'm looking at the clock and its 2:28 AM, I've been up all night drinking and thinking about the day life ends. Hopefully soon.    

I'm only 25 yet It feels like I've reached the end of the line. Life is just a constant struggle of standing in line and trying to survive. No girlfriend, kids, friends, a broken family. It's just me, myself and I and Mrs. Brandy. I've contributed nothing to society and why should I? Society has given me nothing but pain and disdain for everything around me.

How can you expect them to be happy?

I want to die. It's all I can think of. This suffering isn't ending, because I am never good enough and I never will be. My parents tell me to just suck it up and fight against it. To stand up for myself for once. To try to change. But I can't. I'm just weak. They're right, I'm never going to accomplish anything in life. I'm never even going to be able to get a job and keep it.

"My last job was initially a 12 month contract, that I extended to 16 to cover the department's busiest period. I really liked almost all of my colleagues but hated the work, as well as the studies I had to do alongside (work related qualifications). That, alongside depression that had gone undiagnosed and untreated for, let's say 9 years at the time, led to me letting the contract end and leaving.

My last contracted day was 31 August 2016. I started taking antidepressants in mid December of that year and started online Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in late December just gone (having been on the waiting list since October 17, maybe).

It feels like I've gotten dumber by the day. At my worst I was playing videogames for maybe 16 hours a day, just for the escapism. I listen to a lot of podcasts these days but even then, if the weather is shitty and/or I can't drag myself outside then I'll just throw GTA V on and grind that whilst listening, doing the same boring missions that I stopped enjoying long ago for the in-game money that I don't even need to buy stuff that I don't even want. 

My concentration was always better in work compared to home study, but the brain is a muscle too and I fear I've lost that ability to concentrate in this time out of work. It feels like I've got dumber every single day in the pursuit of that escape. Even when I'm listening to podcasts that are educational, that doesn't matter. It feels like the brain itself has lost its processing power and memory. 

&gt;Edit regarding escapism: I feel the need to distract myself at all times. I've had a rail card application pending for around a week now, I just remembered after posting - sorting it now. How am I supposed to be relied upon to do the simplest of tasks? 

I have stopped socialising, having seen one friend once in I don't know how many months, I even stopped chatting online, having muted the group chat. I just seem to have no interest in what they're talking about and don't have much going on to talk about myself. As a social circle we don't seem to have many common interests besides football, gigs/festivals and getting wasted. 

I had a hot streak in early December with applications and got five job interviews in a week and a half or so, being successful in my third &amp; fourth choice, accepting my third choice. Admittedly it's still pretty good, pays better than the fourth as well, but it is further away. This sounds like a r/humblebrag, but the problem is that I barely did any prep for any. In fact I just relied on prep for the 4th choice, which came up first of the lot, probably ruining my chances in the others. Almost certainly the second anyway, as whilst they were both rather long shots, I thought that interview went surprisingly well - guess I'll never know if more prep could have tilted the balance. The job was far more interesting, the pay difference was pretty significant, plus I'd have gotten free train travel to and from work - I'm still massively bummed out about that.

All this and I haven't even mentioned the fact that I can't get to sleep before 4am. I'm still miraculously in the habit of waking up early, so I tend to get a few hours, wake up at around 8am, be too tired to move, fall back asleep and wake up at somewhere between 11:30 and 1:30, feeling like shit. 

I've looked into going Keto for a while now, but since as long as I can remember I'll take the lazy route if eating crappy junk food over even making a bowl of cereal, so the idea of meal prep is stressing me out no end, not to mention doing the shopping for it.

"I have no job, and I still haven't finished college. I have no friends, not mention a partner... When I check my social media, I see people that have all these things that I lack: confidence, money, intimacy, happyness. I know it's just a smokescreen, but I have nothing posted on social profile, because I don't have social events, no money nor a good job to help construct free time. I don't have self-esteem, because nobody will ever understand me, and I started isolating myself from the herd, because I wish I have studied philosophy, instead of computer science. And I hate computer science, because I am just playing with it. I don't master it, I don't understand it... therefore, I lack the skills to even be considered for a job position. Also, when an HR speaks with me in an interview, he can clearly see that I am a nervous/anxious person, which is not compatible with a youth environment. I just want to finally finish college and get a job in computer science! My obsession for thinking is also killing me, since I've also hold some unorthodox and pessimistic views, and I can't transmit any (but negative) emotion to anybody. I am more interested in philosophy, economy and politics, than in entertainment. I avoid thinking about or finding a partner, because it just makes me more aware about my holes, which in turn makes me realise that true love doesn't exist in this world. Love is materialistic, and you have to be an outcast, to trully realise that nobody will ever love a jobless, depressed, unfulfilled piece of shit. I honestly think that paying a prostitute is a much more honest 'relation', because you recognise that everything in life is just a transaction. You exchange a service for another, and if you don't have enough resourses, you will die worthless. Meanwhile, there will be others who will have too much, and being unaware of their own privilege, they will treat you like life was just for us all along. I have come to accept this cold lesson, but whenever I tell this to others, they look at me as if I am a mad man.

Leaving my philosophy aside, I am tempted, and I want to leave things as they are... So what if I am living with my mom at home? So what if I will work at McDonalds? So what if I will forever be alone? So what if I return home tired of working, and thinking about the meaningless of life? The thought of lost opportunities, drives me more crazy, than the thought of acceptance that nothing actually matters. This whole managing my whole life, so that I can become accepted in society, and messing things aroung, makes me suicidal.

So I leave this question to you: is it worth fighting to become part of socety or is it better to accept your meaningless to them and continue your 'unfulfilled' life, knowing very well, that you will face the monotony? I am tempted to put in practice the latter.",2,"you have to be an outcast, to trully realise that nobody will ever love a jobless, depressed, unfulfilled piece of shit"

"Bit of a selfish rant I suppose...been suffering with depression and anxiety for quite some time and currently am taking meds and starting counselling next week which has been arranged by my employer. 

Tuesday was the first day back to work after the Christmas holidays and I couldnât face going in so I told them I was working from home which was fine. Then this morning came around and I laid in bed for a good 2 hours before convincing myself to take a sick day and be alone with my thoughts (working from home wasnât an option today) 

Iâve been home all day just dotting between Reddit, naps and the Xbox recharging my batteries but everyone close to me has tried to contact me to see that Iâm ok and ask if I want to be visited. Iâve had 5 concerned messages so far including coworkers, my manager and my mother all asking what they can do to help and I just want to say âleave me aloneâ but canât be rude or ungrateful even though itâs making me feel worse.

"  All my life, I've been told (I'm sixteen right now) that ""You're in kindergarten, it's going to get harder in elementary school,"" then ""If you think elementary school is bad, just wait for high school."" I'm in high school right now and it's the worst fucking time of my life. Being told that college is much harder and that I'm going to have a much rougher time is almost too much for me to just think about. I don't feel like I could go on any longer if life still only goes downhill from here.

  Just for some background, I've always been a high honor student (then honors, but that's fine since classes get harder). I've always put a lot of weight on how well I do in school, and my parents (well, my mother) would be noticeably disappointed or annoyed when I would get anything less than my absolute best. Because of pressure from myself and others combined with some kind of anxiety disorder, I've had at least twenty major anxiety attacks directly related to schoolwork and grades. And this was just in elementary school.

  Over the course of Junior High to High School, I've developed depression to add on to (and in some ways replace I guess?) the anxiety. I feel like I have no motivation to continue on doing my work, however the fear of getting bad grades still lingers, even though I can't force myself to do anything about it anymore. On my last mid-semester report card, I was failing two classes and getting Cs on the majority of the rest. I feel ambiguously about my grades now- it's tearing me apart that they're so low, yet I feel like I don't give a fuck about doing anything about it.

  And if it gets worse from here, I don't feel I want to be around much longer. But this feeling isn't new. I've completely prepared myself and stopped just barely short of attempting suicide three separate times, each time about three or so months apart from the last. A few hours ago, I stumbled across this subreddit, and I decided I'd try something new and share what's going on online.

  I was kinda afraid of sharing something so personal online to a lot of people I don't even know, but I feel that's for the better since I feel I can't actually reach for help to the people I see regularly. My father tends to get overly worked up about these things and I feel whenever I bring up the subject he panics, spends about a half an hour calming himself down, and then completely misses that I was reaching for help. My mother is the opposite, and (I think, though I may be wrong) views my having depression as a choice and a way to get out of work, as my grades have been steadily dropping, and I've been awake and active less and less. 

  And so I thank you, everyone who has gotten this far, you've been more help to me than most by simply listening to me about my situation.

So my question is, does it actually get any better from here?

"My boyfriend told me he had been diagnosed with depression when he was 15, now he's 30. He takes medication prescribed 5 or more years ago without any medical control. A year ago he had been working with therapist for several months and since than nothing has changed (both in his and mine opinions).

From the one hand, he doesn't want to work, his parents give him money (despite it's hard for them, they both work). He is a journalist, so he can write articles but he doesn't want to. From the other hand, the only thing he cares about is ""social revolution"". He has even moved to another city to be closer to his friends in a radical organization. He participate in demonstrations and so on, but he still cannot wash the dishes after dinner. Anytime I ask him why he does nothing but ""revolution"" he tells me that he has been depressed for 15 years. In the same time he has no depression-related pain, he enjoys food and sex, he sleeps well even without taking his magic pills.

I'm an activist too, but I have two jobs, study languages and do at least something. I had two derpessions in my life, I took medication and I still visit my therapist several times a month. I know what depression is, but if I have depression and realize it than I go to psychiatrist or therapist and do whatever they prescribe. Why doesn't he even visit a doctor, if he tells he's sick?

To my mind, he is trying to get rid of any responsibility in his life, so he has ""depression"". We've been together for 2 years, I love him, everything is ok when I don't ask him about doing something. As soon as I do, ""depression"" comes. 

I don't know what to do. I want to stay with him, but not with his ""depression"". I see my father living in a kind of similar condition, and I don't want to be his sponsor or feel guilt for ""not being empathic enough"", doing whatever he needs, as my mother does.

"I feel as if depression has turned me into some sort of subhuman creature. Every time I talk to one of my friends, they tell me about their days stuffed full of classes and going out and traveling and somehow still fitting in basic care of themselves and their homes. They talk about living their best lives, and how they are in their prime. I feel like I am talking to a completely different species. 

It takes an incredible amount of mental willpower to get myself out of bed in the morning and feed myself. I can't fathom having the energy to work, go to school, take care of myself, dedicate time to friends, hygiene, cooking, cleaning, planning, and more all in one day, every day. But everyone I know around me my age seems to be managing such a busy, full life.

"For my most of my life I wanted to be a musician. My best friend and I were in a band together and we were building something.  However, as I entered my mid-20s and entered a serious relationship, I felt competing priorities and wanted to potentially pursue career paths that had more stability and less time away for things like touring. 

Since then, I've been locked in paralysis for over a year about I should be doing with my life. I feel a lot of regret about leaving the music path, yet don't feel confident enough to rejoin it either. Similarly, I feel hopeless attempting to commit myself to another path that will make me fulfilled. 

The more I think about things and analyze them, the more my brain takes me down a dangerous path of regret, anxiety, and despair. 

Any words of encouragement of solidarity would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",2,"felt competing priorities, wanted to potentially pursue career paths that had more stability "
"I went to therapy for a few sessions and the book ""Feeling Good: the New Mood Therapy"" was required reading. The book highlights unhealthy thinking patterns and trains you in how to spot them. I've found that All or Nothing thinking is a root to much of my hopelessness and causes self fulfilling prophecies. 

For example, I assume that I'm going to suck at a job and never get promoted, so I don't try hard because I view the effort as futile. The prediction therefore fulfills itself.  

I recommend this powerful, encouraging book, it's available in B&amp;N for about $12.00. It's the foundation of all modern Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that modern psychologists use.

"I'm a 38(m), and I've been taking Cymbalta for a little over a year. About 2 months ago, I started feeling very depressed again for no reason, and having bouts of extreme anger. I informed my doc, and she doubled my dose to 60mg. Since then, my depression and anger have gotten much much worse.


My life is amazing right now. I have a wife who loves me and supports me through all of my depression and anxiety issues. She is learning how to talk me down off the cliff sometimes, but it is a crapshoot as to whether she is able to or not. I have two wonderful little girls, who bring me so much joy.


Yesterday, I had a terrible day all day. I can't get motivated to do what I need to do at work, and when I do, I have terrible anxiety that I'm going to fuck something up and get fired. I spent most of the day yesterday shaking at my desk, because I couldn't even make myself move half the time. I got home, and had a fight with my wife, because I was taking everything she said the wrong way, to the point that I eventually just broke down crying for NO REASON. I cried for probably 45 minutes over nothing.


These episodes are happening more and more frequently. The last time I remember feeling this way was when I got the bright idea to stop taking my Cymbalta completely, and that was an unmitigated DISASTER. I had a complete breakdown, and nearly left my entire family. I'm terrified that if Cymbalta has indeed stopped working for me that I'm going to have to stop taking it, and will end up having another breakdown.

"Forgive me if my English has some errors. I'm from the Philippines and I'm going to try to explain this as clear as I can.

I have a friend/classmate who has a girlfriend, who we're gonna refer to as Jane. They are both helping each other out in their problems but Jane is also a victim of abuse and we're trying to go the right step in getting help and to keep her safe.

Jane is sexually and emotionally abused and her mother and stepfather do not care about her. Jane has been raped by her uncle during a reunion in her mother's province. They were supposed to go there again this New Year but she didn't come and came to my friend to talk about it to his parents (more on that later). Her mom wouldn't listen and disregards it and her uncle continues. Jane's also been getting thin these past few months. Her drunk cousin also raped her in a separate occasion. She also has a sister who's separated from her parents but makes up stories and once sued their mother and won. She's also not to be trusted and she also doesn't care about Jane and she is manipulative.

At the same time Jane also has an ex (lesbian/tomboy) who threatens to commit suicide if she doesn't stay with her. There were times when my friend got punched/slapped by her ex but my friend didn't fight back. Both of them and my friend are depressed and have thought about suicide but to calm things down Jane agreed to stay with her for a while. However her ex became too controlling and threathened to hurt my friend and she also made suicidal threats and is trying to break them up. Her ex also blackmailed him and hacked his Facebook and sent numerous messages but fortunately we got it back. Jane and her ex are both in the same school while me and my friend are in a different one.

My friend brought her to his parents and told them what she's been through and still going through. They had a talk about her family, her ex, and the abuse. They now provide her school allowance and sleep in her classmate's house and are planning to report them but it would need to take time and resources to demand them in court. But so far they are going to lay low and take some time for now.

"So to get straight to the point, I have struggled a lot since puberty with, well, everything in life in general. Socially / emotionally kind of fucked, dont really want to explain the details here. 
Anyway, I have almost no (close) friends, have not ever had a relationship, that kind of good stuff.
The only good thing I guess rn is that I nearly have a bachelors degree. The downside is that it took me a really long time to get it, AND it is not the bachelor I started out in. I started out in a Engineering degree, almost but not quite Electrical Engineering (lets say 85% EE), and I got bogged down after about 1-1.5 years. The first year I did not do all that badly (though the important major subjects I failed, but I still got an average amount of credits). The second year I did worse but still not bad enough to convincingly say I should quit. The third year I failed extremely hard and basically gave up. After that I switched to a different major which you could say is Engineering ""lite"". I also switched because in the last semester I took 4 classes, of which 3 were extremely tough, got extremely stressed overwhelmed, and thus failed them all. 
I am happy that at least I almost got a degree now. But I can't really say Im passionate about what I do now. So I do not really want to do a masters degree in this field.
Could not really say that about the first major I did either. But I still find it hard to decide if that was because I am fucked as a person, or because I did not put in enough effort, or because I truly dislike the material/subject. Now I dont know what to do. Starting all over again is not an option. I can finish the first degree but I doubt I want to do the masters degree that fits with that degree. Very stressed about all this shit.

Background on my interests: been a computer nerd since very young age. Loved it. Love hardware and software. Knew very early on how to build a computer and all that stuff. At the same time learned about how to install an OS, repartition, all that stuff and really liked it. I just developed from there. Dabbled in overclocking and other stuff involving ""tweaking"". Love all of that too. Never really did any programming though. Only started doing that in college. I kind of like it but dont love it. 
I am passionate about certain music. Puberty / adolescence were awful for me. Had terrible self esteeem issues (still to a certain degree) and it fucked my life up. Shitty consequences like Social Anxiety and probably some depression too. When I most needed I did not get the help I needed. Also, those who could have helped me did not or did not understand it.
So, I got into music like Nine Inch Nails, and it has become an integral part of myself. Trent Reznor is the first person to truly make me feel less alone and genuinely seems to be someone I have important things in common with. I love that feeling. Later I found the works of MJK. I like a lot of that too. Celldweller is another good one. I like to really dig deep into the music and especially also the artists behind the music, and what makes them tick. On the other hand, I find it hard to relate on a deep level with most other human beings in my life. These people make me feel somewhat more sane, without them I would feel even more alone.
There is probably more I could write about this but I think it gets the point across.

I also like a bit of photography (tend to go through phases with that) and I like some films / series a lot. 

I like cars a lot too. I am lucky enough to own a decent one. 

Finally I like doing some sports and just general exercise. I quite like running too especially when you get runners high (sometimes I get all these big vision of ambition success which then fade quickly after).

"I know people say not being interested in previous hobbies is a textbook symptom of depression, but it kind of contradicts other things that I hear.

I'm 19 now and since around 15-16 I guess I slowly started to get more towards the state that I'm at now. I used to play a lot of video games (not to the point of completely neglecting everything else, I've always had great grades and some friends in real life) but I've slowly stopped playing them because none of them are the least bit rewarding or interesting to me.

I've tried to pick up other hobbies like reading and watching movies (they both just feel like chores that I am forcing myself to do), and I have ran cross country all throughout high school and now doing it in college through the club team at my school. It's hard to measure interest in running since it's not really something anyone does for the shear pleasure of doing it. I do feel good after a run for like an hour and I love the feeling of being impressed with my position in a 5k race and striving for a better time, but that's really it, it's not natural enjoyment I guess if that makes sense. It's all achievement driven.

I feel like I have tried so many things and I just haven't truly enjoyed an experience in the past few years. It sucks because it's killing my motivation to do well now in college because I'm starting to wonder what's the point of it all. Even socializing with people doesn't give me much joy. Probably because I'm super socially anxious and never feel like a connect personally with anyone that much other than with close friends that I've had since elementary school, which are like 3 people.

It annoys me because I hear of antidepressants making people feel numb, but it works for them because that's better than the pure sorrow and darkness that they feel in their everyday life. But my problem is actually that I feel numb, so how the hell am I supposed to treat that? 

Like I'm not even sad very often, I just am constantly bored and seeking something that actually would grip my attention. I sometimes just want to sit and stare at a wall for a few hours because it's as entertaining as anything else and requires the least amount of mental energy.

I guess it's OK to feel bad about low goal achievement(IE, I shaved today, today was a good day, that feels more insane to me than thinking about killing myself)  and that you should practice feeling good goal achievement, no matter the amount or degree of goals achieved?

Is it about effort?  Can effort be enough?

"Hello all, 

 My name is Justin. Iâm 30 years old, drug free and enjoy the occasional beer. Iâve recently become homeless do to losing my job. Iâve been suffering with depression (Iâve been in therapy for the last few months) for letâs say the last five years. Which in return has caused me to lose a lot of relationships and trust for people. Heck, Iâve even lost my relationship with my own mother because of this. 

 Anyways, Iâm scheduled to move into a place in the middle of January, but until then Iâm out in this cold weather. Iâm from a smaller town about an hour or so from DC in Virginia. Which in return has limited shelter space and resources. The shelter is double full basically every night. Social workers point me every direction. Anyone have an ideas on what I should do? I start working next week thankful, but Iâm losing more steam everyday out here.  Ideas? Comments? Any helpful tips to keep my head up? Iâll try to respond as quickly as I can. 

Thank you so much for your time,

"I'm 2 years away from graduating from medical school. Its been a long and painful journey that I feel has irreversibly damaged my mental health. I'm not the same person I was when I started and I don't know if its because of a past toxic relationship, school or something else. I originally went into it because I wanted to help people (bit of a cliche, I know) and I was interested in the human body. 

But now I don't know if its what I want to do. I can't focus on the work, I find it boring and I hate studying. I feel trapped and isolated. I don't get on with other medical students - I try to be friendly but the only way I can be around them is if I'm not myself. 

Increasingly, I've been drawn to the creative industry. I would say I'm quite stylish and love dressing up and coming up with outfits. There is this creative world that exists where everyone knows each other and I want so badly to be a part of it. 

The only thing is I have no skills, talents or even interests. There is nothing I love enough to work hard at. I read a post on here that said not everyone has actual talent (although, I feel like most people do) but they work hard. I've tried loads of different things but I never like anything enough to continue with it. I've tried sewing, dressmaking, painting, modelling and styling (I did actually really like modelling and sort of liked styling but got stressed out that the outfits I chose weren't good enough). 

More than anything, I wish that I was musical. If I could be anything it would be a singer or rapper or even producer. The music industry appeals to me so much - the thought of people who've never even met me from all across the world listening to music I've made and resonating with those words and appreciating my talent is amazing to me. No other job could give that. No other job is as highly renowned. Musicians have a legacy that is never forgotten. People admire them and their talent even after death. They stand for something and change cultures. 

But again - I don't have a musical bone in my body. I wouldn't even know where to start. Every musician (or anyone hugely successful in their craft) started from a very young age - I'm almost 25. I also don't have the time. I would feel very stupid trying to do it when I don't have a natural calling or even ear for it. A girl I used to know who is now a famous singer told me that if you were supposed to be doing music you would be doing music. Everyone who is successful naturally fell into that path and worked hard at it. No one randomly says 'I want to be a rapper today' (or an actor or a fashion designer) with no experience or talent and then becomes one. 

Not knowing what I want to do and not having any talents, or even anything I like a lot; on top of the pressures of medical school, which I'm struggling with, is making me feel trapped, isolated and depressed. I see a therapist. 

There are 16 year olds who have done bigger things than me and who have more idea of what they want to do and are working towards that. I wouldn't mind if I was at the early stages of something where I wasn't very good but still knew what I wanted to do and liked that thing enough to keep going with it. I have absolutely no idea what I would want to do and be ok at or become good at, with enough work (because I don't think I could ever be good at music). I know its not supposed to be easy but I thought at least having a dream or passion would come naturally.

"Hi,
I started college this year after a gap year and I went to a major that I was really excited about and I was preparing for it. Itâs arabic language and history major. 2 months in I knew somethingâs just not right. One of the teachers is really demotivational and the classes were really hard. But I kept going because it was my dream to go to this school. Now itâs finals month here in Czech and I just donât know what to do. I suck at the language, I tried but I just donât get it so I told my family and friends and everyone just says that I cannot give up! âYou have to go through finals! Give it a try!!! You have to push yourself and do the best!â 
But Iâm pushing myself I guess Iâm just not pushing as hard as everyone else. But I donât want to push too hard. Iâm already really depressed I started going to therapy because of the school, Iâm crying everyday. I donât think I can get through. 
Why is everyone telling me that I cannot give up? Why is âgiving upâ seen as such a bad thing for people? 

My long distance boyfriend is the only one who supports me the way I need. He is motivational and heâs saying that itâs okay to quit. But you know, heâs not here and even though he is my support I need something to tell my family or just people around that they will get and not see as a bad thing to do (giving up).

What am I supposed to do about my worth? I feel as if everything I try is a failure and I convince myself of that fact. I can't handle any criticism because it consumes my entire mind and destroys any confidence I had to do something. I'm now finding it impossible to do any schoolwork because I've decided that no matter what I do I'm going to fail. 

I have no intimacy in my life and that makes me feel like I'm not good enough around my peers. It kills any confidence I have around people so I just try to avoid any social situations.

I know these thoughts are unhealthy but I can't even force myself to try to get better.

"Hi everyone,

First time posting here, so apologies if this is out of place.

I'm currently a 19 year old that's just started at university in Montreal, Canada. I've recently come to accept that I may have been dealing with depression throughout my life. If I think back, there have always been these periods where I've felt like I've been just barely holding on and every experience is muted. Then I come out of it and everything seems fine. Then the cycle repeats.

I've been reluctant to seek help or talk about this due to a number if factors. I'm too proud -- I hate admitting that I'm not managing the little things we have control over in life. In the positive periods, it's so easy to forget the dark ones. They've been just enough to propel me through the standard hallmarks of being ok, and then I think ""surely it can't be *that* bad"". Third, I'm still heavily dependent on my parents financially. That's sort of an endless cycle and I'm not exactly in a position to break it atm.

This past month has been the third time in 6 months that I've hit another low point, and each has been progressively lower. This time, I'm really terrified of the thoughts that keep coming up. Earlier they came up, but I was able to push them aside. Now they come up and I'm seriously (almost calmly) considering them. I've never felt more hopeless in my life. Obviously, this has been affecting me more than usual and I feel like everything is going downhill. Other than my family, I'm really reluctant to talk about it with my friends because I'm worried about how it would affect them since I know a number of them have mental illness.

I finally tried talking about how I've been feeling with my parents in these last weeks. That culminated in them finally accusing me of being a self-centered liar who was just saying things to get attention, blaming me for ""accepting negative thoughts from other people"", asking me if I'm possessed by some evil, and threatening to beat me and pull me out of university. So obviously getting their help to deal with this is not an option (which shouldn't surprise me tbh). 

I feel like I'm on the brink of really messing up, and I know it's my responsibility to seek help for this. Even if there's no way to beat it, I want strategies to make sure it never hits me this hard again.

"I'm sorry if this post ends up being long, I'll try to keep it short but please read to the end if you can. Basic background information: 20 almost 21-year-old male, I'm currently studying computer science (in my 3rd year in college). I actually took the 2017 fall semester off because of how uncertain I felt about actually studying computer science and I just felt terrible in general due to anxiety/depression. During my time off I worked to save up some money and sought help for my issues. Been going to therapy and got meds for anxiety but nothing for depression. Everything was going relatively well/getting better until I had to go back to school. My thoughts of self-doubt began to creep back in and everything just feels joyless. This always seems to happen when I feel stressed about change or literally anything else. I've lost a lot of interest in things I usually enjoy and just feel down. I feel like a failure because I'm thinking about changing my major with a year left. It'll most certainly add an extra year to my college career (I understand that this is actually somewhat common but it still makes me feel bad). To make it even worse, while I'm feeling uncertain of what to study, I genuinely have no idea what I'd study instead cause I'm so damn indecisive. I don't know where else to turn. Computer science seems cool to me but the work seems so joyless because most positions are desk jobs from what I can tell which makes me feel depressed knowing that's what's waiting for me when I graduate. I've spoken to guidance counselors, visited a few places to do job shadows, and done countless hours of career research and I'm just feeling so done with all of it.

I wanted to be a police officer. I talked to everyone about it. Went on ride a longs. You. and it. I really believed in helping and protecting people. That was my calling. Due to what life throws at you, I was able to start applying in my late 20âs. And today, at the age of 32, I said no. See, in the 4-5 years it took me to get accepted somewhere, one has to keep going with life. And I did. I got married, got a decent job with decent pay, was able to buy a tiny home. Just life.

Didnât feel physically ready for the daily challenges which I was told could lead to my dismissal from the academy; during the time I did exercise and prepared myself I injured myself a lot (knee, back, shoulder), which at the academy could lead to a possible dismissal; also, the academy is a âlive-inâ academy, meaning that Monday-Friday I would live at the academy, something my wife was having a lot of emotional problems dealing with that thought; lastly, I would be lying if I said that the whole live-in academy situation did not worry me - it was, and a lot. There has always been something âwrongâ with me when it comes to attachment. I am that guy that cannot say good-bye. And the thought of being away from my wife 5 days a week and dealing with the stresses of an academy really worried me to the point that I knew I would want to come home. So I made the âadultâ decision that it would be stupid to go knowing I would not make it and risk my financial stability. 

So now Iâm sitting here. In tears writing this. The last two weeks have literally been like death. I have nothing to look forward to. I have nothing that interests me. I am not applying to any other departments because of my age. My body was holding on to this academy and I donât have it in me anymore. I really have no purpose. I hate everything about my job - it eats my soul bit by bit. I donât have suicidal thoughts. But I do feel like Iâm sitting here for another 40 years waiting for my turn to go.

"Hello, 

This is my first time ever posting on something like this and I am searching for some help.  Long story short I would like to die. Iâm not getting any of the satisfaction I used to get from my hobbies. Plus Iâm kicked out with no job and no school. My motivation to keep on living everyday is slowly diminishing. Iâm just very lost, Iâve also lost my father,  and older sister. I just want things to stop hurting, itâs been over 7 years. ",2,m kicked out with no job and no school
"Hi guys i really really want to die but every time i want to do it i think about all the people who would be sad about me killing myself.

I'm 23
*5 ft 7
* Receding hair
* Gotten ugly (used to be very handsome and have women constantly flirt with me)
* I got fired from my job
* I've destroyed my brain through abusing internet/video games - can no longer think anymore.
* I've blown all my money on gambling and prostitutes 
* I have a terrible OCD/body dismorphia problem that makes me obsessed with working out / eating healthy (to the point that it is damaging my life + 
* This has made me lost the majority of my friends)
* I've never had a gf
* i'm also pretty bad socially, often quiet and shy (Social anxiety)

I want to just kill myself

Everyday I have thoughts saying just do it, do it, i want to die.
Just do it.

But it's so hard for me. e.g. i have a 13  year old cousin (Single child) who looks up to me and thinks i'm the boss.  If i kill myself how would he feel? what am i supposed to do?",2,"got fired from my job, blown all my money on gambling and prostitutes"
"Hello, my name is Pranav. I am an 18 year old guy, living in India, currently in the last year of school with about 50 days to go before my final examinations. A lot depends upon my performance in these exams - most importantly, my dream of studying in Canada, and the image and respect that I've built for myself all these previous years.

**I am not at all prepared for the exams!** For 2 years now I've been struggling with inner demons (procrastination, severe escapism, depression). I went to a shrink, I took pills (stopped 4 months ago), I even saw a pseudo-psychologist with radical methods which were helpful (short-term) but very oppressive. No longer doing that either.

I have a great life, loving parents and brother, and all the comforts, leisures and resources one might need. I have potential and ambition, **but no drive**. Sometimes I feel as if I am just lazy, worthless or stupid in some way. I am certainly pitying myself, which is the worst. No surprise that I've often contemplated suicide but never did it.

I never stopped researching my own condition and I believe that I have finally come across **one helpful treatment**. It's called Metacognitive Therapy (MCT). But as it turns out, I suck so much that I didn't stick with it either!

**NOW,** here I am. A well-endowed and capable human being, with tools and knowledge. I know what to do. What action to take. But I feel shitty all the time and keep wandering off to wasting time. I got rid of my computer but I cannot do away with video games.

I feel shitty, stupid, guilty, insecure, helpless and like a failure. I am on a self-made ride for self-destruction. I have the tools and **ONE LAST SHOT AT SALVATION**. But I am guilty of self-sabotage [I have all the information that I need but I just can't break free from the vicious cycle of inaction and also **I keep gorging new information, especially spiritual stuff** even though I don't need it!]. I need help. Help and support that none around me can provide (without being judgemental). I feel lost and at the mercy of fate.

Thank you for hearing me out.",2,"am not at all prepared for the exams, For 2 years now I've been struggling with inner demons,procrastination, severe escapism, depression"

"Dunno, it striked in my head, I just writed : 

""The whole bid for submission by current managerial values is based on almost one mistake: the confusion between working and fulfilling one's potential""


Have it something right ? I'm speaking of course about the social way we are seeing work. In the way work as it is socially understood, is really one dimensionnal, like if somewhat every competency that humanity was able was separated in each individual, impacting view of life of each. We are always referencing to the quote ""work is tripalium"" and stuff in social term.
Imo it's at least currently (while not in IA society :) ) a false idea to modify work, because while there is a hierarchy/domination, even from outside workforce (government manage work activities while work hierarchie = smooth/flat), there will be always some form of resistance finishing with creating new morality, new idea, and cutting off what work are mean to do : producing for surviving as a species.


Accomplishing your potential mean you use actually fun, you use imagination, you use discipline, you use your emotions, you use self control, you use your ability to introspect, you use your memory, perhaps ultimately a excellent work would be one that reflect the most the life wich all are actually living, meaning you have to use your memory in a global way, not being limited by artificial rule we are creating. A real work have part of actually not working, and not being managed for not working as it happen in homosexual company in silicon valley.

Isn't it a problem for those who are seeking actual accomplishment  ? I don't mean forcibly extra uppa uda mega accomplishment, just for the stuff itself. There is ppl wich are actually working better in choosen activities / in hobby mode. Aren't you more concentrated in this place than in work ? I'm not saying that writing in reddit is a higher accomplishment than your work, probably not if you are in IT for example, but writing here require more completeness than doing 1 repetitive task for all the month there another one then another one...

The main problem with trying to submit ppl with moral (like in our typical managemental way of seeing the work world) is that it end with devaluing moral itself more than being in a complying/not complying problem",2,"a false idea to modify work, because while there is a hierarchy/domination, even from outside workforce"

"This is going to be a long one.

Cliffs:
- I thought it was going to be something more 
- I wasnât fullfilled 
- following your dreams doesnât make you happy
- You are sold a lie to get you to consumed 

This is my story of quiting my job to travel the world and follow what I thought my passion was.

So for the past 6 months I have been planning to quit my job so I can start a travel vlog channel on YouTube and work on photography and film making. I bought some gear, I even got free products from companies because they believed in my vision. I honestly thought this was it, like I thought this was going to be my thing. I thought I was on the right path doing this. I thought this would be my dream. I thought travelling the world sharing my pics and videos would make me happy and fullfilled. So after 6 long months, the big day finally arrived. I was so excited guys like I was over the moon about it all. This wasnât really a holiday for me this was my time to focus on my craft and work towards my goals in youtube, photography and film making. But honestly after a few days something started to change fast. I didnât really feel good, I felt like annoyed that I had to edit this vlog or edit this photo. I became very unhappy and unfulfilled extremely fast. The only time I felt good was when I was high on mushrooms and drunk on alcohol (that was for nye only) but I started to ask myself âhey do you even enjoy what you are doingâ and to be honest I didnât. I thought travelling the world sharing my journey with everyone would be fullfilling, I had friends and others tell me they were inspired that I had the courage to do this, I kinda felt like they were looking up to me and that my decision to do this would make them more confident for them to go after there dreams and I know that is a very positive thing but that wasnât motivating for me at all. 

I am a simple man. I donât give a **** about money or fame, pretty much my core value is to live a happy and fulliled life and to be surround by good people. The 9-5 isnât for me. Hats off to you if you are ok with it but for me personally I couldnât think of anything worse then sit in a box under arterfical light for 8+ hours a day t days a week plus the commute. When the realisation that the thing I thought was going to be my thing wasnât was the most crushing feeling I have ever felt. It got to the point where I almost broke down. 

I have had successful online businesses in the past, but even when they were successful I wasnât happy because I quickly realised this is like a 9-5 where I am only doing it for the money, I felt no joy or fullfillment from it so I quit. I currently do crypto investing, doing alright with it. Made 2k today but honestly yet again I felt no joy front that. I think a lot of people see other peopleâs lives on tv or social media and say to themselves âI want that lifeâ I was the same, but I quickly realised I was sold a lie. Some of you might comment saying âyou are just depressed broâ honestly I donât think I am, I believe 99% of depression cases are miss diagnosed. I believe a lot of it has to do with people living unfullfied lives. Yes maybe 1% have a chemical imbalance but I strongly believe majority of people are not happy because they are not living unfullfied lives 

Right now I am thinking of just going home take some time off to revaluate. I must say though this really is painful this feeling. Thinking that something is going to be your passion and honestly believing in the bottom of your heart this is your thing but then realising (especially so fast) thatâ itâs not is depressing. I just wanted to make you aware that the whole âquit your job to travel the world thingâ might sound cool and all but I promise you itâs not going to make you happy. To me the only way to live a happy and fullfilled life is to do things you actually enjoy, to be on a road and to actually have some sort of direction.",2,quiting my job to travel 
"I believe I have struggled  with depression and anxiety for a long time but the past year or so seems to have dramatically increased it. 

So here's the story: 
I had been working a job at a tire shop which I didn't not enjoy with people I didn't get along with. I was seeing a girl who was in an open marriage who eventually became my best friend and biggest supporter.
I was giving the opportunity by a buddy's parents to join the merchant marines and go to the seafearers school in piney point. I was not sure if I would like it but his mom was very persistent that I do it and since joining the military was always a dream of mine but was out of the question due to my past, I agreed.
I have always separation anxiety for some reason, even though I have never felt particularly close to much of anyone or anything. I knew I would miss my family and friends and skydiving (which at one time was the only thing that really made me happy) and booze but I went into the seafearers program with all the promises of a wonderful, rewarding career making more money that I could spend. 
Well, needless to say, the ""school"" was not the prestigious, academy in which I was told. It was more or less a free labor, brain washing institution full of ignorant criminals and, pretty sure, illegal immigrants, ran by a union which I'm pretty sure is a mob front.  None the less, I got through the first phase of the school. The girl I had been seeing at home was very supportive and we texted everyday as we had for the entire year we had known each other. I was working out everyday and was reading a few self help books to try to help cope with being away from everything at home. 
Immediately after the first phase of school, you are sent directly on to a ship which I was assigned with two others from my class, one was a guy I got along with pretty well and the other was the biggest piece of shit I have ever met in my life. There were good and bad days but to be honest I really wasnât into it, working everyday and only making $35/day however, I kept telling myself that it was a good experience and that it would be better next time. We did have shitty internet on the ship so I could communicate with my family, which was rare, but again the girl would text me everyday.
So  that tour was done after 90 days being on the ship in the middle east. Time to go home, finally.
I went home with almost no money, still living with my parents but after over 7 months, was ready to see everyone again and the girl I had left behind and to finally skydive again. This is were things turned for the worse. I soon realized that the  warm welcome home I had hoped for wasnât what I had coming. Most of the time I sat around my house drinking alone frustrated with myself, my finances, the fact that I was 26 with almost no money, no real friends, still living at my parents who are having to pay my bills while Iâm trying to get through the rest of this program, still hoping that it will be worth wild. The girl I had been talking to the past year was always busy and seemed to never have much time to hang out and we began arguing more and more because, being the jealous person I am, wanted to be with her all the time. I kept skydiving on the weekends but eventually, it became frustrating to me as well and lost most of the joy it once brought me. There were many time I would hope for a malfunction that would let me go in or times when I would consider simply not pulling. 
After about a month I went back to the âschoolâ to do the third phase. I got through it and even through all our issues me and the girl who I was now very much in love with, still texted back and forth everyday. Adding  to my self hatred, I was in love with a married woman. Everyday at the school, my class seemed to be in trouble for something. Losing the few privileges that were available to us and getting assigned daily extra detail. After two long months, it was over and time to go home and await shipping assignments. I was pretty sure I wanted nothing to do with this union at this point but didnât want to let my buddyâs parents down, they had put a lot of effort into me doing this and really wanted me to go through with it. So I decided to go home and wait for them to give me my assignment. At this point, it has been almost a year since I have made any real money and having my parents and grandmother paying the few bills I had which made me feel terrible. 
When I got home, the same problems as last time. I felt alone, completely alone. 
There was a part of me that was looking forward to shipping again. As this time I would actually be making a wage. After about a month of waiting, I was assigned a ship which I was hoping to get to see some interesting ports and make some money. Well got on and found out there is no internet and the only way to contact anyone was through a terrible company email program. Found that my wage was basically bullshit with my overtime rate being $12/hour and then I saw the ship schedule, fucking middle east again with only a few ports on the way that we were allowed to get off at for maybe an hour or two. On top of that, the cooks were awful. There was hardly a week that went by were someone wasnât sick from the food. Then, about 2 weeks into the voyage crossing the Atlantic,  my laptop charger was surged and ruined so I couldnât access the four terabytes of movies and books on my hard drive I had downloaded for the trip. I was able to get off in a port in Italy to try to find another charger but ended up having to buy a whole new computer just for the charger I needed.
Somehow while at sea, my debit card had been used in China for almost $800. I was able to have that taken care of but my card was canceled giving me no access to my money until I could get home to activate the new card they had sent me.
Then we got stuck in Beaumont Texas due to hurricane Harvey for weeks. One night, after things were beginning to open back up, me and another guy went out on the town. To get in and out of the port from the ship, you have to be escorted by port police from the ship to the gate and vis versa. Upon returning to the ship, I was sitting in the backseat in the middle with the other guy in the front passenger seat and the port police officer driving. The idiot cop wrecked the police truck directly into a concrete support beam sending my face flying into the steel divider of the police truck busting up my face and sending me to the hospital. After getting stitched up and a few days bac on the ship, I was eventually sent home.
Back home again, I was sent to a doctor and complained about upper back pain that radiated into my neck and shoulder pain. They told me to do physical therapy 3 times a week at their facility for 4 weeks without them taking x-rays or anything. I did that reluctantly, constantly asking to be referred to a specialist to have an mri done on my upper back and shoulder. After the therapy the doctor finally ordered an mri on September 25th. It took me a month of fighting back and forth between the shipping company and the union insurance company to get the mri  and finally got it done October 25th, the day after my birthday. Finally, I thought but come to find out, he ordered an mri on my upper neck. Not my back or my shoulder. At my follow up appointment, when confronted about it, he assured me that it was suppose to be my shoulder and back but after leaving the room for 3 hours, he returned to say that he thought my neck was more of an issue than  my shoulder at the time. My neck only hurt from the pain that was in my back which I made sure to express from day one. I asked if he was going to reorder the mri to actually look at the problem to which he replied no that I would have to deal with the pain for the rest of my life because there was nothing else he could do and he cleared me to go back to work even though I could hardly move my head, sit up straight, or lift my shoulder.
Over the next month I had hurt my knee somehow but hoped it would eventually get better. It would lock up if I bent it and the only way to get it unlocked was to go down to ground on my knees and sit back on my feet. The girl I was in love with at this point and I continued to see each other but seemed like less and less, maybe a few times a month. We went out one day I had decided to cut back on the drinking and got very drunk to the point I had to cut her off and take her back to my house. She wanted to have sex but I told her no because she was so drunk but she kept trying. She started telling me things like âwith you itâs different, I donât feel like  a piece of meat like everyone elseâ I asked her who is everyone else and she told me she gets paid to have sex and she was a prostitute. I didnât believe her but was insistent, trying to find a so called website she was apparently on and showing me text messages from people she said she was only friends with before where she has been sending nude pictures and explicit messages. When she woke the next morning I confronted her about it to which she had no recollection and admitted to seeing and having sex with multiple other men and women but not the whole being a prostitute or getting paid for sex which she still denies to this day. Being the only person I have ever felt like I could talk to, I still talk to her, which makes me hate myself. 
Over the next few weeks I hurt my other knee and had surgery on both meniscus. I was told I would be back walking in a few days with full recovery in a few weeks before I went in for surgery.  I went in for surgery and my mom had taken me and the girl that broke my heart asked to be there, I agreed to it and they both waited during the surgery. I woke up in leg braces being told that it was worse than they thought and that I would be in leg braces for up to 10 weeks. No skydiving, no rock climbing, no running or working out, no walking except to and from the bathroom with crutches. I couldnât believe it.
Today is the end of week 4 of being confined to my bed in my parents house to which I live. Only being able to go out for therapy and almost no one has came to visit me. The girl has a few times but itâs awkward and I keep trying to find a way to forgive her and some way to trust her, why, I guess I feel like sheâs all I have. My mom has been having to do pretty much everything for me which I canât stand. I sit here all day in bed frustrated, bored, depressed, worrying, hating everything that has happened, wondering what could possibly be next until I finally just give up and start downing any alcohol I can get my hands on. Back and shoulder still messed up. Havenât heard anything about being able to see another doctor about that issue. Also, about a week before surgery, my clutch went out in my car. I ordered a new clutch and flywheel and rushed to get it put in before my surgery. I did but after a few hours I noticed something wasnât right. I took the transmission back out and discovered that the paint on the flywheel melted and let the bolts holding it to the crank come loose and one snapped off. So now my car is torn apart in my dads garage possibly needing a new crankshaft.

I am constantly trying to tell myself that there is someone else out there that is way worse off than me which I know is true and that is shouldnât complain and that things will get better but at this point, Iâm no longer so sure.

"I'm approaching 28 and I think I've hit my lowest point of the last five years. I've had my issues for as long as I can remember. Particularly after my dad died in my early teens. Things just never really made a whole lot of sense to me. I don't think I ever really understood the concept of school, y'know? I get that it's supposed to prepare you for life, but it all just seemed like something I had to do so I wouldn't be bothered. Even in my senior year, I never really dreamed about ""being"" anything. 


Jumping ahead to where I am now, I've essentially done warehouse work off and on for the last 6 years. I quit my last job this November, and I'm pretty sure my family and room mate are pissed at me for it. I'm not really the type to talk about my feelings and all of that face-to-face, so I basically told them that I couldn't deal with it anymore. What really happened was that it was night-shift, and it was something that I hated. The one thing I've come to know about myself is that if I'm feeling depressed, lack of sleep will completely mess me up. The night I resigned, I spent the first three hours of my shift trying to keep myself from breaking down and crying in front of a group of strangers. The kicker is that I don't even really have a good reason for it. I think being there and being exhausted and doing nothing meaningful just kept building up this creeping fear that my life had no meaning. Had nothing to do with the job at all.


I was looking for work without much luck up until this point. I've been doing some online work here and there, but I suspect it won't be enough to keep everything going so I've essentially just started applying anywhere now since I'm going to start feeling the financial strain soon.


The people you get to know in blue-collar jobs are pretty straight-forward. They look at jobs and productivity, and will jump at the chance to call someone lazy if they aren't working as hard as them. I think that's what keeps a lot of these guys going, working dead-end jobs they hate. They get into this mindset of self-praise for the hard work that they do. And how they work harder than Guy B. And how Guy C is a lazy POS. So on and so forth. My room mate got very angry at me for quitting recently. He essentially said I was being lazy and I haven't had a stable job and a long time and I should be more like him. We met at a previous job and he's been there for almost 4 years now. The problem with his argument, in my mind, is that he hates it too. He's always trying to leave early or take off. And somehow, even at my worst, I seem to do better financially than him. Don't get me wrong, this post isn't to rant about him. It's more about the criticisms the people around me have.


And I suppose it would be unfair to say that I'm NOT lazy. I don't enjoy doing things that I hate, in what seems like a fruitless cycle of ""work to live, live to work"". That's not an argument you can make around these people though. I guess I would have to come out in full disclosure of how fucked up I am, otherwise I'm just being lazy.


Reading through all of these job descriptions recently makes my life seem more and more bleak. I just don't get how things seem to make sense to everyone around me, but it just won't click in my head. People will work near a decade doing something they hate but continue the cycle. On my end, I've just entered this ""numb"" feeling where I'm convinced that I'm never going to understand any of it and I should just be looking for peace from life itself.


I don't really know what I expect to hear from a post like this. I just felt like I had to share it with someone before I snap. Can anyone relate, or have general advice?",2,"done warehouse work off and on for the last 6 years, I quit my last job this November, and I'm pretty sure my family and room mate are pissed at me for it."
"and in ways that wouldn't hurt anyone if they found out. it's all very subtle, and the way i do it is mainly through poor self-hygiene. it might seem trivial, but it's pretty effective. i currently haven't showered in 5 days, and i feel like garbage inside and out. if someone finds out it's been a while since my last shower, it's whatever. they won't suspect that it comes from a place of self-loathing, and i never let it get so bad that they worry.

i will go without brushing my teeth, washing my face, showering, and changing my underwear for as long as possible without it being super noticeable or causing significant damage to my health. why care about my health? health problems can cost money, and money problems can easily become an issue for my family and not just me. and then of course, i can't have others noticing my poor health and worrying.

"Today it finally happened. I ran out of my last money. I literally don't have enough money to pay for food. I am having financial troubles for a half year now. While I'm still at school, I do a side job to pay for my study. But that employer doesn't have work for me anymore. I have to quit. I'm probably gonna fail school and a couple of months ago I let go all my relatives. Today I have like 2 or 3 friends, but none of them are the type of friends that can borrow me anything. I literally don't know what to do anymore. 

Wish a burglar would just walk in and shoot me in the head. Or a car would just run me over. I don't have the power on my side. I don't feel any love from this world. I have a belt lying beside me, but I can't bring myself to wrap it around my neck. I still have dreams, but I don't know how I can survive from here on. 

My only wish is that I could escape to place where there is no one. Where I could be me and enjoy my usual stuff like music and anime, where I don't have to perform to get a decent salary, where I can just live.

"Let me start off by saying that I wasn't always this way.  I used to be an advanced student in elementary school and had a passion for reading and learning; I could absorb knowledge and I had a social life. Then, things took a drastic change in 5th grade for no obvious reason.  I suddenly felt tired all the time; as if I didn't sleep enough.  All I could think was ""why am I so tired? I'll sleep more tonight"" every day.  For the first time in my life, I failed a test.  I broke down in tears in the middle of class and was surrounded in anxiety and depression.  I also somehow ""obtained"" adhd/extreme forgetfulness and started losing my ability to properly comprehend people speaking to me and use my mind's eye to visualize anything...  I was uninhibited in many social situations (my best friend's mom thought I was using drugs before I even knew what a marijuana was) and extremely anxious in others.  Stimulants didn't help much besides giving me energy and although anti-depressants help with my mood, all the other symptoms remain.  I have a feeling that this is a brain tumor or brain damage because of how it affects me so broadly.  I've never had suicidal thoughts and honestly, I don't think too much at all.  Nothing crisp, anyways.  I'm 19 now and not sure where to proceed from here.  My mom believes it's because I became an atheist and my dad thinks it's because I just don't care. Professionals (doctors, therapists, psychiatrists) don't seem to know what's going on with me.  My thyroid and bloodwork is fine and I got a sleep study done.  Should I see a neurologist or another specialist? ",2," first time in my life, I failed a test.

"When I was in high-school, I screwed up any and every opportunity to get into Ivy League by getting suspended.

I also just lost my scholarship to my current college because I didn't get the minimum GPA required this past semester. Though my dad is paying for my education, I don't want to burden him unnecessarily. So yes, it pains me that I lost the scholarship. And my first real girlfriend (of nearly a year) just left me in the middle of that semester. She's not coming back, either.

Guys, my resting bitch-face is turning into resting Slav-face. (No offense to genetically Slavic people...That was just the best analogy I could come up with.) That's how terrible I feel. Nothing has made me smile genuinely for more than a second--and the best ""smile"" that I've even had lately was just changing my current face into what would be my neutral expression if I were happy. Not even memes make me laugh like they should. Not even when someone else shows me one, it doesn't; and I'm not faking it because that would honestly require too much effort out of me.

I lack so much energy that it takes me thirty minutes to get out of bed. And no, I'm not on my phone or anything. I just lay there. I don't even think about anything while I lay, either; I quite literally lay in bed for thirty minutes and struggle to actually get up. And what's worse is that I don't wake up by my own volition. My dad comes in and wakes me up. Speaking of that...My own dad told me on Christmas Eve that I was ruining Christmas by being lazy and noncompliant with him. He yelled at me and told me that I was to ""change [my] attitude"" or leave the house. It's not an attitude. I don't know what to otherwise call it, though.

What's worse is that my dad hasn't let me outside of the house for the past three weeks since my break from college started. He told me ""You're going to be productive while you're on your break. The only way to succeed in college is by doing more than what's required of you."" So I've been reading my English book two months in advance and answering all the guided-reading questions that correspond to each passage from dawn until dusk. I've gotten barely any sunlight whatsoever--and this only because I have a window in my room. And I haven't gotten exercise at all.

Besides the lethargy that I've been feeling, my metabolism has went to absolute shit. I haven't eaten more than a meal-and-a-half each day...and I'm talking about ""normal-person""-sized meals: normal portions...and I'm bigger than a normal person. I weigh, like, 100 kilograms (226 lbs)...yet I've been eating like an anorexic person. In fact, I was sick earlier this vacation and vomited anything that went into my system. I literally couldn't even eat a sandwich for two straight days. And I've been sick with standard cold/flu symptoms for the past week or so.

Even my sleeping schedule is off. A normal, healthy person sleeps eight hours every day. I've tended to sleep much longer than that...and I still don't feel well-rested at all. No amount of earplugs to drown out external noise nor sleeping-masks to prevent sunlight from awakening me has actually led me to a good night's rest. I tried NyQuil, too...but that didn't give me rest. It just drained my energy and forced me to sleep. It didn't give me rest at all, though.

If I can't change this...this intense feeling of malaise, I'm not sure what I can do. I guess I'll just go to my J-term class and see if I can't pretend that it's all O.K. Maybe I'll suddenly feel better if I just can pretend...hopefully...

But the thing is that this sadness is beyond tears; beyond simple and vague melancholia. It is an emptiness; a void. Since my mother isn't really in the picture (and so only my father is really here), I guess I could say in German: ""Ich fÃ¼hle mich mutterseelenallein."" And I do feel deserted. But I know I deserved it. I deserve everything bad that's ever happened to me and that will ever happen to me, because I'm such a screw-up. Even my own existence is a mistake. I was adopted at birth from two people who had a one-night-stand and no intentions of ever getting married with each other. Okay, yeah, they loved me and wanted me to have life. Thanks to them.

And thanks to my adoptive mom and dad for having fed, clothed, and sheltered me...but my adoptive dad doesn't love me like he should. He wanted a child whom he could be proud of. When that didn't work for my older brother, he focused all of his yelling and threats on me...and I've been forced into subordination or else exile. He's made me into something that I'm not, and I'm not comfortable. But I don't even know what I am, because I've been forced so much to be something that I'm not. But this isn't about how my dad fails to acknowledge mental health issues; this is about how much of a terrible person I am--and I am very much such a person.

I won't go into the details, but the reason I got suspended back in high-school was because I made an ironic and edgy joke about killing myself. (Say what you will about me; any rebuke just furthers the point that I am the scum of the Earth.) No, I wasn't suicidal. I was just into extremely offensive humor at the time.

I also am a long-time user of pornography. I have seen unclad women since I was ten. Now Iâm eighteen and have the worst imaginable sexual kinks. Iâm so fucked-up that I have a thing for torture and pain. And at this point, there can be no argument that I might ever do anything BDSM as an act of love. At best, Iâd do it as an act of self-pleasure because I so lack love--although even if someone would want to do it with me, Iâm not sure Iâd even be able to. Iâve had rapid bursts of sexual urges followed by long (multi-day) periods of not having the slightest feeling of wanting to relieve myself since this break started. Iâm sure that any girl with enough sex-drive to even tolerate BDSM would want it several times a day. So I wouldnât even satisfy such a girl.

And, despite the above, I believe in God. I donât want to do anything outside of marriage, which further proves my fucked-upness. Besides the fact that, even from a secular point-of-view, Iâm fucked-up, I now am doubly so fucked-up from a Christian perspective. And all happiness is supposed to come from God. So I guess Iâm so fucked-up that not even God wants to make me happy or something. I guess He wants to emphasize how much of a misbegotten shit I am.

As someone of illegitimate birth--as someone who could have been slaughtered just as easily as adopted--I am against the notion of abortion. In all ways, I am against it; even in cases of rape. I believe in the forgiveness of others (and yet I wonder whether I, too, will be forgiven?) because I find abortion to be punishment against a child for the sins of its parents. Someone who could have become a very close friend to me has just blocked me on Facebook because of my stance. I guess, besides not being good enough for Ivy League nor for affordable college nor for kindness from my father nor for happiness from God, Iâm also not good enough even for friends. Literally everyone who likes me doesnât know me whatsoever. Anyone whom I ever hang out with starts to drift away from me after maybe two hang-out-sessions. And Iâm heavily introverted: I donât just âlook for new friendsâ like that--but besides that itâs socially uncomfortable for me to seek others in such a manner, itâs also futile. I am unloved and have almost zero confidence that I will ever be loved--especially not by myself.

The worst part of this all is that a hobby of mine is composing and playing music. At the absolute maximum, Iâve done that for perhaps three hours out of three weeks. (And I feel as though it would be the same even if my dad would let me do whatever I wanted.) If I werenât such a disappointment and a mistake, I would easily do it for six hours every day...but, alas, I am a mistake. So I havenât even been doing the things I like to do...

And at this point, after much reflection on how bad of a person I am, I'm not sure whether I'll be happy again. Iâm not asking for help, though. I just wanted to...You know what? I donât even know why I wrote this, nor why I bothered to. I donât care about support. Love doesnât exist in my life like it does in othersâ. I donât even care about getting it off my chest. I just felt like having my voice heard, perhaps.

"Since I finished high school like 4 years ago my sleep is seriously fucked up, I just can't fall asleep before 5-6am and then it's extremely difficult to wake up and get out of bed before 3-6 p.m. I am sleeping between 12-15 hours a day. Since summer I am on ADHD medication, Trintellix, and some sleeping aid plus I am trying to limit my caffeine input. The medication helped but not a lot. Some days when I have mandatory classes or lab work at college, early in the morning, I skip sleep completely, being a walking zombie the whole day and then I sleep the next night. When I sleep for 8 hours I just feel tired, if I don't have something obligatory to do I cant get out of bed, I tried a lot of things multiple alarm clocks, have my mom call me nothing, etc. I just want to sleep for 8 hours like a normal person and feel refreshed.

"I made posts about me not wanting to go to school, but I grew lady balls and put on my happy mask and went. 

just a side note that during the break I decided I was tired of feeling the way Iâve been feeling the whole school year and to deal with my insecurities. I have a big fear of being alone and i tend to depend my happiness on people. So to start I cut toxic people off and limited my phone use. I got off my other friends backs and continued to develop a friendship thatâs been blooming. I already start to feel better about myself.

So I quit a sport and I lost friends. I was so upset because I was alone again and started to resent other people that seemingly had a better life. But I realized I shouldnât beg people to stay in my life and if they want to leave they can. Plus everybody isnât perfect, and the comparing yourself to others just makes you more unhappy with yourself. People come in and out of your life as well, because everyone has their own life to live ya know? 

But anyway I got switched to new class today and it turned out I know everyone that sits at my table from past school years. I was so happy to be presented with the opportunity to make new friendships. Lunch kind of sucked bc I cut one girl off and she didnât sit with me but I discovered another developing friendship switched classes and had the same lunch. Lucky me! 

In the morning I used to freak out because I had no place or group to sit with due to the sport being early in the morning. So I decided to deal with it and sat by myself in the library until 1st period started. It helped me realize that my social anxiety is just me and nobody really gives af if you are by yourself minding your business. Same with other class periods where I donât have close enough friends. 

On top of this, I got my work schedule and Iâm working a lot this week so I can stay busy. Itâs like my life is getting back together and Iâm trying to stay as positive as possible. I just wanted people to see especially if youâre in high school that school isnât the devil you see it to be. 

Iâm thankful for this sub and for the redditors that have given me advice. I realize that everyone has ups and downs, nobody is perfect and everyone has insecurities. Even when everything is at its worst thereâs always something good in your life, even if itâs that you woke up today :) ",2,got switched to new class today and it turned out I know everyone that sits at my table from past school years.

"This is my first post to a subreddit so forgive me if I fuck something up. I am going to keep personal info vauge incase someone I know ends up here. So here it goes. From a young age I always knew I had things worse when compared to others around me whether it be financial situation or relationships but in the past couple of years I really found how different I was. My dad was abusive to my mother, they split when I was 2 however I do know my father but he isn't a father in the traditional sense. I randomly see him every few years and I am like ""Oh hi dad"" then he is like ""hi son"" and boom, that's it fast forward 4 years and rinse and repeat. I was never really fond of any of my family, I despise one of my siblings  because he is a fucking scumbag and really dislike my mother because of her stupidity and ignorance and shitty attitude toward me. I have a meh relationship with the rest of my family. When I younger I was really interested in video games, I never had any friends, not a single one, due to lack of similar interests and the location of where I live. Fast forward years later and my situation has only changed negatively, from the years of being locked away in my room, I have developed extreme social anxiety (not officially diagnosed but I know the symptoms when I see them) and have only fallen into a deep state of sadness, dunno if it is depression. My social anxiety is horrible, I shit myself when needing to get a haircut or go to a store. My school is bad too, I talk to people but they are not my friends, I pretend they are so I don't look like a complete fucking loner. I have never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl either and I am not even a bad looking guy.  My only actual friend is someone I met on a game 4 years ago. We talk everyday. Which is even more sad. I am beyond petrified of turning 18, because once I do, my mother will make me get a job, or I will live on the streets. I am scared to get a buy something in a store, how the fuck am I getting a job. Just the pass summer, I didn't leave my house once, there was no reason to, I have no friends to go out to. I stayed in my house for 3 months and never left once. My current situation is I stay in my room wasting away with every passing day. And I only become more and more sad as the days go by. About a year ago I have finally come to terms with the fact that I am going to end my life before I turn 18. I feel no reason to live on, I will not fair well in adult hood anyway. I know a lot of people are just going to pass this off as another bullshit post where the author dosent actually die and lives on happily ever after, this isn't that story. I will be dead within a year, period. Nothing will change my decision to end my life. I plan to hang myself with a belt that will be wedged between my door. I will not leave a note, I wouldn't give my mother the pleasure of reassurance to why I did it,  she dosent deserve it. These aren't my only reasons why I want to die. One small one would be the fact that baldness is big in my family history, so even if I get my stuff figured out, I still have balding to look forward to. A big reason as to why I am going to end my life is the curiosity of an after life, I am not religious so I don't beileve in anything specific, but god damn I am jelous of the dead, they know what comes next. Worst case scenario, its nothingness which still sounds better than my life.

"EDIT: I should clarify that I only draw keys. I'm not doing inbetweens. I can't animate for shit alone.

I'm a 20-something artist who just started an underpaid job at an animation company. It's only been 3 months and I already feel like a talentless hack. I don't even know how I managed to get this job. I don't even have a solid showreel and I don't have the time to build one. I honestly feel like shit about it. I cannot even enjoy making art at home anymore. I need help.

4 years of college was a waste. My college was shit, they didn't teach much for the amount of money my parents helped pay and sometimes I regret not quitting sooner but it's because of that place that I found the person I really like and look up to. They're a great animator and I wish to follow their path if I could. They don't know it but they're a great inspiration.

I've been crying for days and I can't focus on my work. I wish I could just quit but that's not a really good option for personal reasons.

I wish. Someone out there could teach me animation, 3D especially. I'm so desperate. I don't have the money to pay for online schools and I've had no luck finding good tutorials for everything I need to know to really get into this industry.

Right now I'm doing 2D animation but I want to move to 3D after this job. I know how to use the basics of Maya so that's not a problem. But I feel stuck. Paralyzed. I'm scared I can't make it alone. I don't even know if it's possible to transition just like that.

This post is going all over the place right now but I really needed to let it out and get help if I could. And no, I don't see a doctor to see if I have mental health problems or not. I don't talk to my parents about this either because they are conservative and religious (Not telling what religion) and let's just say I'm not ready to tell them I might have mental health issues.

Please help me. I don't know what to do. I'm holding tears as I write this in the office.",2,"artist who just started an underpaid job at an animation company,4 years of college was a waste, college was shit, they didn't teach much for the amount of money my parents helped pay"

"Hello :)

I want to make this short. I was never diagnosed with depression, though my mum, ex-girlfriend and best friend who lived with me told me, that they assumed I was depressed. Whether thats true or not, I think I really need help with my life.

I gotta feeling that I don't do anything good with my life. I am just wasting time on the internet to distract myself.

I just want to know how to start to take action. I think I know excactly what I should do to become happy and to fix my life. I collected information, made daily tasks (which are totally possible to fulfill) and want to improve many aspects of my life, though i become overwhelmed. I don't even manage to stick to my healthy eating plan. So I end up doing nothing or just a few things and waste most of my time. I need to change something drastically.

So my question is: is there any trick to start taking action? Any form of mind trick? How can I motivate myself? I just need to go through some days to see the improvement and then hopefully it gets easier, but I need a start...and at the moment I feel like I am stuck in this pot of laziness, vegetating.

What helped you? How did you manage to achieve this initial burst of action?

Thank you so much! Every response will help me tremendously!",2,just wasting time on the internet to distract myself

Hello,

I'm sorry I don't speak *my language* well, so i'm writing this in English. My name is --------- ------, but you can just call me ----. I'm 18 years old and I am ---- ------, I was born and raised here in -------. I'm just a student at an international school really. Things aren't working well, they've never worked well. For years and years of my life I've lived with thoughts of falling to my death, drowning in my own blood. Years and years of depression that was neglected. And now it has come to the point where I no longer am stable, I can't bear it. I am in so much pain. I hear voices sometimes, they tell me to kill myself and they laugh at me. The depression became so much more worse, with constant thoughts of dying, my meaning of life being nothing, everything equaling up to nothing. I have lived with an abusive father my own life and my mother, grandparents, sisters, relatives, and even myself have acted like nothing has happened for so many years. It was years of being traumatized that I didn't realize had affected me so bad. This morning, I didn't want to join him for an appointment as it would be expensive for both of us and he should only do his checkup for now. I had talked to my father in a calm voice, using ""please"" and ""I would really not like to"". He then proceeds to shout at the top of his lungs as if he were a lion, it is quite a shocking and traumatizing roar. Then he proceeds to punch me until I fall to the floor and he kicks me and punches me while I am in a fetal position. He then got a big jug of water to dump on my face which I was choking on because I was already screaming for help and choking on my words before that. I lay on the floor crying and screaming and begging anyone to help me. I live on the 18th floor of my condo so no one could. I tried to though. He physically abuses me often, and after it he cries and begs me for forgiveness. I cannot take it anymore. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my younger sister whom I love so dearly. I think I've lost my sanity at this point, I have no hesitation to harm myself and I leave the house at 3am and go for long walks and come at 7 or 8 am. That I've stopped just for my mother because it frightens her. She as well who keeps accusing me of being a whore because I go out on my own all the time and where clothing that shows off cleavage and also have a curvy figure.(I have large breasts so it's hard to find a shirt that isn't a turtleneck to hide anything decently) Those walks were the only source of happiness I had because the feeling of walking away from my home was magical, and now I don't recognize the feeling of happiness. (It's quite ironic since my name means Happiness in Hindi) Please help me. Or at least give me some answers, some information. Please let me talk to someone from your association. I am begging you, I need this help. I need to tell you more. I have some money with me, I can give it. You can do tests on me even, please just talk to me. I have a high IQ, and am about to major in psychiatry myself. Please contact me here or my number is **********. 

Regards,
**** ******

I know I was coming off desperate at the end but I am. I'm severely depressed but I don't want to be! I don't want to be like this anymore. It's been too many years of this abuse and I cannot bear it with how bad the depression has deteriorated my brain. If anyone wants to talk about this more, please feel free to dm me. I am on another account then my main one cause I don't want anyone recognizing me or friends knowing I posted this.

"I just want to start this off by saying that I've never felt better than I do now. In the past few years I've dropped out of high school, managed to find an alternative way to graduate, and then pass a semester of college to drop out of the next one. I've struggled with finding the purpose of everything my entire life and therefore never put any effort into anything I've done.

I've been on and off three depression medications in the past and now I just recently started my third. I truly can't tell a difference when I'm on or off the medication. I don't know if I have depression or just a lack of motivation to do anything. I don't know what's wrong with me, or if there's even a depression medication that can help me.

My psychiatrist visits last about 5-10 minutes with her prescribing me a medication and sending me on my way. My parents really dislike her because of her medication strategy, but she's the only one in my area for 300 miles. With all that being said, She prescribed me dextroamphetamine 3 months ago alongside my depression medication and I was able to close out this college semester with a 4.0, I've been able to wake up for work everyday at 4 AM and work anywhere from 8-12 hours a day for the past 2 weeks while on break and I'm taking care of myself better than I ever have before.

I feel so good, but I'm worried. I'm losing track of the pills of dextroamphetamine I'm using a day. I have to down 5 pills of melatonin a night to get sleep, I have to down 4 pills of ibuprofen every morning because I've been working my body so hard. I down 6 pills of dextroamphetamine throughout the day to keep my energy up and enjoy being at work. I'm going to become addicted, I'm going to build up too much tolerance, I won't be like this for very much longer and I'm worried. I wish I could feel energized all the time, why do I have to use medication to function. I wish I wasn't so lonely that I have to open up to reddit because I have nobody else. Why can't I be normal. Why did I even bother typing this. Why am I looking for acceptance right now. I don't even know how many pills I'm downing in a day just to accomplish a regular work day that everyone else can do normally. The answer is that it's too much.",2,"dropped out of high school, managed to find an alternative way to graduate, and then pass a semester of college to drop out of the next one,struggled with finding the purpose of everything my entire life, put any effort into anything I've done"
"Back in October I lost my job. I was a temp at a college and my boss didnât know there was a limit on the length of a temp contract. The thing is, she had been doing kind of shitty things and when I finally held firm on my personal boundaries- boom. Come to work, worked for 2 hours, told to pack up. I kept my cool, but when I asked if I could use my boss as a reference she said âwe can talk about that later.â Iâve been seeing a therapist since the day I stood up for myself, just before they let me go though. The therapist is great and I understand that my old boss was manipulative, unfair, and just a shitty person. Still, as the sole breadwinner for my husband and kids I felt like I had been punched in the gut and the feeling hasnât really gone away yet. 

My husband is going back to school and also takes care of our 2 girls ages 2.5 and 5 years. He is getting better at being supportive but is pretty much the most unemotional person Iâve ever met. He doesnât understand that my depression is not a choice. Why on earth would anyone want to feel this way? My psychiatrist and therapist keep emphasizing that I practice self care and give myself space but whenever I ask if I can just be alone for a bit, or go out with friends, my husband acts resentful. 

In late November I started a new temporary position whoch should go through March, and all I do is go to work, come home to a crazy house (we also live with my loud, dumb, &amp; chatty af mother-in-law) and then go to bed when the kids finally concede. I feel fine at work, almost good sometimes, but as soon as I come home I feel totally overwhelmed. I have few escapes and I find myself wishing I could disappear from the world and that my family would magically forget me so that they wouldnât be hurt and I wouldnât scar my kids for life. 

Tonight I brought up taking a class I really want to take two nights a week, which would mean I wouldnât get home until after the kids are asleep, and one of those nights my MIL or my parents would need to watch the girls for a few hours. My husbandâs reaction was basically through gritted teeth âit would make a lot of things unnecessarily hard, but if you feel like itâs what you need to do...â

So the words were ok, but the way they were said changed the message entirely. Like I said, he doesnât have/process emotions well so Iâm trying to tell myself that he just isnât aware that his resentment seeps into things all the time and ruins them. Straightforward- âI think itâs too much,â compromising- â how can we work around the schedule conflict?â Or ACTUAL support- âI know you need to something for yourself.â Would all be fine, but saying something vaguely supportive with a hostile attitude feels manipulative. I keep wishing I could just go to my momâs house for the first time in my adult life because there even though my parents are weird they also can just be straightforward or supportive without emotional strings.

So tonight I went into my space-out mode after the class conversation, which then turned to silent sobbing. Couldnât read to my kids because I was crying and they couldnât understand me, couldnât do anything. Husband just sat around with me and the kids, never asked if I needed something, or wanted to be alone for a bit. No acknowledgement whatsoever about the fact that for over an hour I sobbed while it upset my kids. The lack of response is almost worse than the conflicted responses, but both leave me feeling utterly alone and wanting to die. There. I fucking said it.

So here I am. On Reddit. I canât imagine anyone actually reading this, and the truth is what difference would it make? If you are reading this, thank you. I hope that you are coping with your challenges better than I am, and that you have someone who can support you in the ways you need.

Now that I've finally done it I do not feel any less empty. I do not hate myself less. I still feel hatred towards myself and old doubts have been replaced with new ones. I do not get how I can go on if this is all that is going to happen. If I keep achieving things and I still have so many doubts that weigh me down or ones that leave me empty then what is the purpose of going on if you are always going to fail in some way. 

I used to also think that if I ever met anyone special that I would develop some confidence, but  if I didn't get any after this goal then how will a romantic relationship help me?

I'm scared that I will not find a meaning in my life, that I will never find worth in myself as a human being. Part of me really wants to just quit. Just stop it all so the feelings go away.

Now I want to make it clear, I've had  depression and anxiety  for about 4 years and it hasn't gotten any easier hell it's the reason my last realtonship  ended in flames. Anyway so I tried not to succumb to the pressure  and bad thoughts that comes with anxiety  and depression so I started to try as hard as I could and even still I started to fail my classes so I thought well fuck how am I supposed to deal with this and the same day someone I thought I could count on decided she didn't want to be friends anymore so instead of coming and talking  to me like an adult she decided to call the cops and wrongfully  accuse  me  of stalking and tried to have me arrested long story short I ended up having to spend a night in holding. So I lost a friend and to make a long story short my whole world is crumbling right in front of me, I left school, I don't have a job and I think one of my best friends I think doesn't want to be friends  anymore and you know what I don't blame her, and just for now we will call her, M and truth be told I've kinda developed feelings for,  M as much as I like to deny that it's the truth, this might not even be in the same category but I'm also an extremely violent person I got it under control in the past few years but that doesn't stop the thoughts hurting someone else as a kid once I stabbed  another kid in the arm with scissors, even my other friends, I'll name them A, and J,  I think of hurting, I honestly  don't know what to do.

"I **need** this year to be better.

I'm nearing the end of my third year of college. The new semester is approaching quickly, and I desperately need a good one in order to save me from failing.

I failed two courses last semester. I was miserably depressed the whole time and it showed on my GPA. That was my free pass; I can't afford to fail any more. If I do, I won't graduate on time. If I don't graduate on time, I don't graduate at all because they'll cut $8000 of financial aid and I can't magically come up with that money myself.

But this year doesn't have to be like that. I don't believe all of the bullshit about how the new year promises change and hope. It's literally just another day, except the year is different. Still, I'm mildly optimistic. 

I've never been a hard worker, but that has to change now. I know exactly what I have to do to be a successful student; doing it is just impossible sometimes. 

My depression is like a roller coaster. Before Christmas I felt amazing, and now I feel empty and broken inside. That worries me: if it comes back in full force in the middle of the semester, that could cause a great deal of damage.

Regardless, I wish you all a great new year. Hopefully this one won't be quite as shitty.",2,"I failed two courses last semester, if I dont graduate they will cut financial assistance"

They won't let me move somewhere else, so I decided I wasn't going to deal with it, and ghosted instead of giving a two week notice like you should do.

 One day I decided to quit, move to the big city and get a decent degree in something. Figured I like computers so I'm gonna go ahead and be a computer guy. Got into the university for evening classes but couldn't even finish the first semester cause I was unable to find a decent day job to pay for this education so I got really sad and couldn't focus on the classes, plus I realized that this profession is way too hard for me.

  Years ago got alienated from a few friends I had cause coulnd't stand being a looser in front of them. Never had a proper sexual relationships cause on top of everything I'm a premature ejaculator so I guess it psychologically distanced me from getting intimate with girls. Got a decent body and in a good shape but to maintain it I have to work out regularly and eat crazy amounts of food in order to not become a scrawny ass motherfucker I was in high school. 

So here I am. Almost 30 and have nothing and no one except my mom. And it numbs me. Paralyzes me every second of my life. I can't even enjoy a movie now. Can't watch how all these tall men on the screen live their beatiful and interesting lives without hating myself for my life choices. So I just stuck in my apartment playing videogames all day to silence the pain while mother paying my bills. Nothing interests me anymore. Nothing brings joy. All I wanna do is to die.

English is not my native language so I'm sorry if you got infuriated with my grammar.",2,"got stupid manager education, I hated the job, got into evening university classes, couldnt finish, realized this profession is too hard, premature ejaculator, "
Does anyone else feel this way? When I'm at work I can't wait to get out and relax and not have to deal with the stress. But when I'm not at work I feel incredibly lonely and depressed and can't wait to get back to work to keep my mind off of things. I'm afraid to move out of my parents house because I feel I will be a miserable wreck on my own. I won't even have the comfort of my own family to come home to. Anyone have advice for this?,2,"when I am at work, I cant wait to get out and relax and not have to deal with stress."
"I have several problems. One of them is that I'm 52 years old and don't have a job currently. I've tried searching for jobs and applying but I can't find any.

Roughly a week and a half ago, I broke my ankle while out taking pictures at a local nature preserve. I tripped over a low-cut tree stump that was hidden under the falling fresh white snow. I was rushed to the hospital ER and operated on the following day where the put 2 plates and some pins in my ankle. A few days after that, I was sent to a local old-age home in my hometown to finish my rehab. I've been stuck here doing rehab ever since. My first appt. with the foot dr isnt for a week and then I'll know how everything is going.

I feel very frustrated being in this place and it drives me insane. Luckily I have a private room (it's semi-private but nobody is in the room with me) and they allow me to keep my door shut all the time. I have trouble with sleeping and they give me NYQUIL at night to help calm me down. 

Personally I would like to leave tonight but I have a ""non weight-bearing"" status on my foot and can't do anything at home yet. I'm learning to hop around on one foot and use a walker and everything but it is taking a lot of time. I'm very impatient sitting in this home though and wish I could do something (or my dad would do something) to get me to come home however since he's 80, he wants me to stay in here for a while to get better as well.

I constantly feel as though my life is worthless and this tragedy is just the latest in a long long line. I'm not sure how I can get my life back on track and I've talked to a counselor before for several sessions but really haven't come up with much in terms of solutions. Any help that you can provide would be greatly appreciated...

Thanks very much...

But here's the thing. He's the one who found the course and told me to go and do it. I was so ready for the job and I feel so frustrated that I did the course for basically no good reason.

This year has been nothing but negativity for me, not just because of all the negativity the media has been flaunting around in our faces about the horrible celebrity deaths, but because of my three deaths in my family. All of which I was extremely close to.

I feel like an outcast at my job and pretty much anywhere else I go but I act as normal as you could define anyone as ""normal"" would act. I try to treat anyone I come across with nothing but kindness and hate to see someone get mistreated.

But seriously, to continue with my sloppily organized post about how this negativity is ruining my life, I don't have my life even 1% figured out. I'm 21 which is a young age to have anything at all figured out but as I look around all I see are my friends getting engaged or getting these big job offers that they've always dreamed of. Some of them are also getting excepted into their dream schools to do what they've always dreamed of. One of my used to be closest friends got accepted into a school in Atlanta that will score him a place in TNA which will therefore most likely lead him into WWE. Yeah yeah it's fake and blah blah blah but it's what he wants to do and I've been supportive of him. I work at Lowe's, it's a very loving job and I love the people I work with most of the time, I don't feel like it's enough though. I don't feel like I living up to what I can be, but I don't know what I can/should be doing. Not a damn clue.

I've spent most of my last 6 months alone ever since my aunt died. I'm just very unsocial and it's extremely difficult for me to make new friends. I'm also not one to go and party (alcohol, weed, etc) because it's just not me. Everyone around me is that way and they're even getting into harder drugs. Yes this is the people I work with. My past relationships have both ended because of them cheating on me. I just don't really know what's wrong with me or if I push people away from me for a reason?

What I'm trying to say is that as I look at my friends having a blast on new years eve/day with their families, I sit here with tears in my eyes because I feel like I have no one. I feel very unloved and very unwanted. I just feel like that 2017 is going to be a long year spent as a loner because I just don't appeal to anyone and I don't have anyone to go out and do anything with to meet more people. I don't finwant to invite myself into peoples' plans and I don't want to invite them to do anything because rejection is pretty common for me. I trapped in a very dark place and finding the light seems impossible for me. Someone please help me.

"I'm just a complete mess, and when she wants to go out and spend time with people, I enjoy that to a point, but then it becomes immensely stressful. And I've gone through a really difficult time, Christmas, New Years and 3 birthdays are in the space of a week. I've finished my uni and gone through a car accident in the past 2 weeks. I haven't been earning income from welfare since November so I'm really quite poor.

And I just don't have any way to vent and last night, when new years plans went to hell and my license disappeared, I snapped. I broke as a person. And I tried to be okay and I couldn't be.

"I can't really remember exactly the last time I didn't want to kill myself. The feeling has always been there but I didn't really acknowledge it until about early high school. I can say with pretty good confidence that I've wanted to kill myself everyday since then. 

Reading many posts about what people have been through and their current awful situations just makes me feel more guilty for being suicidal even though I have a caring family and am decently well off. 

My birthday is on new years. I was born just past midnight, so my family and I usually celebrate it on New Year's Eve. However, the last few birthdays I haven't been happy. I always work for my parent's business because we're constantly understaffed. I don't have freedom. I just work. On top of that, I have to deal with the constant desire to just die while having to work. Every year, I'm scared of what the new year will bring, and I resent my parents just a little more for letting me become the happy little accident that I am now. Couldn't they just use a condom? 

2016 has been one giant clown fiesta for me. I'm fully confident that 2017 will be just as bad. I want to make it all end now but I'm too scared of the pain and the nothingness that will consume me once I'm gone. I'm not religious so I don't believe in an after life. Often times I wish I were, that way I'd be more inclined to just get the ""pain"" part over with and to just kill myself already.

So, in the past year i've had 3 jobs. In the beginning of 2016, i worked 2 jobs and ended up just not showing up at both due to some personal reasons with my ex around May/June.

I go to school full time as well. I technically don't HAVE to work, but i feel useless if i don't. I guess the point of this post is, does anyone have any advice on how to keep a job with depression?

"(This is a comment I posted yesterday that kind of explains my life right now and I was hoping maybe if I post it here I can just talk to someone about it.)

I just want my life to feel worth living honestly. 

I'm embarrassed by my body so I'm trying to gain weight and move my 150lbs to 180lbs to gain a little bit REAL confidence so I dont have to fake it all the time. I've got a healthy diet and workout routine going, but until I'm at my desired weight I just feel weak and unattractive all the time.

I just graduated highschool early 2016 and have decided to not go to college. It was four years worth of time in making that choice and weighing my options, now I made the choice and am wondering if I chose wrong. My business is going no where and I am running low on the little funds I have left. I can see my parents empathy for the unemployed graduate is starting to run a little thin too.

On average I wake up depressed 5/7 days of the week and go to sleep every single night wondering where my life is going and how I can manage to reach my goals and dreams. Happiness comes and goes, but 9 times out of 10 I'm just putting on a show. Nothing I'm not familiar with though. That's what my whole fucking life has been. A damn show. Now I'm not saying I've had it bad. My family is kind and loving. And I grew up relatively middle class. What I am saying is that as soon as I started highschool my life became fake. I put on this character so people will think I'm okay when I'm really not. 

I lie to my family and tell them that everything is going fine and that ""Business is great! I'm not depressed at all! Wow yesterday was so much fun sitting at home all alone with no one to talk to and only my thoughts to remind me of how much of a failure I've been recently!"" I'm too damn proud to admit that I have no clue what I'm doing and the last thing I want them to do is worry. Not like it matters anyways. My dad can see my bank account slowly dropping day by day. I tell him I have funds in my paypal, but I'm not sure if he believes that anymore.

Everyone knows I'm failing at life right now too. Whenever someone asks about my job my parents and friends never say that I'm a photographer, or a video editor, or a writer, or a musician. It's always ""well he's just taking some time off right now."" Or ""yeah he's unemployed."" Or ""He doesn't really do anything."" Or worst of all ""Oh he's just having fun messing around with a little photography."" Really? Messing around? So practicing my craft for 6 years and now trying to run a business is just messing around. Well shit I guess they're right. It's not like I'm making any damn money doing this anyways. Today I officially shut it down. Everyone seems to think that all it is is a hobby so maybe that's how I should keep it. I just applied for a few shitty, monotonous 9-5s, the things I told myself I would never do and I feel like I sold out all my values. I've given up everything I stand for and I've given up on myself. I highly doubt I'll even get the jobs anyways. No one wants to hire someone with past experience as ""summer lifeguard"" and ""photographer"".

Stress eats away at my health constantly. If depression isnt causing me to oversleep and then not even feel restes than stress is keeping me awake. I'm eighteen fucking years old. Eighteen. You wanna know what my blood pressure was on the last time I checked? 141/90. I eat relatively healthy, and try to exercise daily and my blood pressure is 141/90.

And don't get me started on dating. Oh damn am I fucked up. Aside from the fact that I have these unrealistic standards for girls I can't even get in a relationship. I've been in four relationships in my life so far right? Girl #1 broke up with me (she ended up figuring out she was a lesbian so kudos to her and no hard feelings on this one). #2 three months, cheated. #3 seven months, cheated. Took her back, cheated again. #4 same shit as #3. I went to one highschool dance. My senior prom. The minute we walked in she said bye and walked off with some other dude to dance. Now I've got these trust issues and on top of that I only chase unhealthy relationships. I get so close to a relationship with someone good then just lose interest because now it's not a chase anymore. What the hell is wrong with me?!

I thought that I could prove people wrong. I thought that maybe they weren't right. Maybe I'm not some fucking loser with no talents. Maybe my dreams aren't stupid and unachievable. Maybe once I graduate, I can show everyone that doubted me that I actually can do it and prove to everyone that following your dreams is an option! Well maybe in reality, that's just something you tell the stupid little kid who thinks he can be whatever he wants so he'll just shut up and leave you alone. 

I'm tired of people lying to me and saying ""You can do it! Don't give up! Dreams do come true!"" I've been putting in the work and got shit. Countless days and nights of no sleep trying to find that next job or making that project perfect. Dreams are just that. Fucking dreams, and that's where they need to stay. The only reason people think they can do anything is because they see a select few people that happened to be at the right place at the right time for a payoff. It doesn't matter if you've worked your ass off or if you just started yesterday, because in the end, all that matters is if you were lucky enough to roll the dice on the time they decided to land in your favor.

Everyday I wake up, put on this 'mask' and make people think I'm happy so that maybe they can trick me into thinking I'm happy too. The problem is now, is that it's not working anymore.

To top it all off, I don't feel entitled or like I'm allowed to feel depressed. I'm not homeless, not raised in a bad situation, I'm white in America. I feel like if I tell anyone about this all I'm gonna get is a ""get over it"" kind of response.",2,"graduated high school, did not go to college, started with business, wonedring if imade worng choices, parents emapthy for unemployed graduate,consider photograpgy craft is a waste"
"The past two years have taught me never to hope. Hope is a very big mistake to be making.

"Hello. So I would like to preface this by saying that I have not been formally diagnosed with depression, but I figured this subreddit would be the best place to seek advice nevertheless. I hope you don't mind me. 

For a while now I have not been able find the motivation to do much of anything. When I have a break from school I mindlessly click through useless videos on Youtube or various useless articles. Virtually nothing holds my attention. I can't get through an episode of a tv show without reading something else. I can't read through interesting articles, I can't finish any books, I can't draw, I can't do any research or even clean my room. Essentially, I can't accomplish anything unless it pertains to a greater purpose than simply enjoyment, or if I have made myself accountable to someone else, and even then I have trouble finishing tasks. It was honestly difficult for me to get out of bed and shower for the past couple of days. I am on winter break currently. 

What makes me the most afraid is that I haven't been thinking-- especially thinking creatively. If I have a new idea to ponder, I never pursue it. I used to constantly be thinking of new art projects and writing prompts, even though they never came to fruition. In school, I am ridiculously bored. I am lucky if I pay attention for ten minutes straight in any of my classes. My grades are fine, however. 

Could I have some advice, please? I am saddest about my lack of curiosity. Even when there was nothing interesting to do, I always had my imagination, and now I am bored with my own mind.

"This might end up sounding like a bunch of rambling but I am tired and have to get this off my chest to someone else. 

The last few months have been really rough. Between a very serious likelihood that I am going to have to drop out of grad school because of a stupid error on my part, money issues, and just struggling with Seasonal Affect Disorder, this is the lowest I have ever been. . 

Getting the ""blues"" during the winter time for me is normal and I usually don't say anything to anyone but this year has been so so bad. Up until now, I haven't seriously felt the ""Things would be better without me"" feeling before and it scared the shit out of. I was driving in car and I had a very real moment of not wanting to hit the brakes as I pulled up to the stop sign.. I am still scared about how bad I was feeling and could feel again. Honestly, on top of the fear and sadness, I feel a lot of shame for being so bummed out and having a thought like that. 

I struggled with whether or not to tell anyone. I was really ashamed with how I felt. I have a degree in Psych and I work in Mental Health so I have given the ""who to talk to/numbers to call"" speech more times than I can count but I was/am scared to admit that I might need it. It took me a couple of days but I did end up telling my boyfriend. I don't think that I can talk to my parents/family about how I am feeling yet. .Just a different type of relationship with them but I told him. It was incredibly scary and I don't think I have ever felt more ashamed/scared to say something in my life. I couldn't outright say that I wanted to die in that moment but I told him how I felt and he seemed to understand. He made sure to do the good boyfriend/person thing. . Was very understanding/supportive but made sure that I knew I needed to tell him or someone if I was that sad or felt that way again. 

I am not saying that saying something made the depression any less or easier but i can say that telling him was a lot more freeing than I thought. I know that he has my back and is watching to catch me if I fall back into feeling like I wanted to hurt myself or something like that. I am glad I did it.

"Okay so this is extremely embarrassing and I have been called everything under the sun from lazy to useless, I have been out of full time employment since 2013 with only one seasonal summer job as a parts driver for a helicopter company last summer. 

In my previous work place which was known as a starter company for the trade I was trying to get into I worked myself into sickness and was bullied by grown ass men into depression. This all culminated into a bad back injury from lifting a 12x12 with a coworker when the coworker slipped and I tried to compensate which made me slip a disc. I was bullied into not filling for workers comp and put on light duty for 2 weeks, this all happened around the time I was finally supposed to get my apprenticeship. Instead I was laid off, to which no one told me until I drove the hour to work but everyone seemed to know the day before. 

So this is the embarrassing part, I had a mental breakdown in my truck then drove home crying. I was so frustrated so angry. I should have gone then and there to the competitor in town and applied for a job, but I couldn't bring myself to so I took a few days for myself and started applying for more entry level trade jobs. Now if you haven't been in or tried to get into a trade, most of the time the only way your going to even get a interview is if you know someone who works for the company. Which unfortunately I was 20 at the time and just starting out, so of course I didn't know anyone in the trade. And then whole oil glut/oligarchy thing happened which made it even harder. 

So I did that for a year, had to move back with my parents, my parents gave me shit when I tried to sell my truck  and they took on the payments. I shouldn't have let them I know, it made me feel so shitty and it still does. So then summer hits and my best friends family owns a helicopter company and this was a big fire year in my province, so he asked me if I could give him a hand so I did. I wish I could still work for them, I didn't think people could be so nice at a workplace. Then summer ended and  they didn't need me anymore, so I went back to looking. Then last winter I slipped and slipped my disc again only this time was much worse and I was laid up for 6 months doing pt, getting injections and seeing a chiropractor. 

Now I've been out of work with almost nothing to show for my time for so long and I have nothing to put on my resume. I did do a few courses to try and get something but that didn't pan out. I have my h2s, csts, first aid and forklift and zoomboom tickets. I just want to live, not exist. I need work, I've tried applying for everything under the sun the past few months. Every day gets harder and harder at this point I think I should just kill myself to relieve my parents of a financial burden , and a embarrassment. I feel like such a failure, I tried my hardest I really did I swear I'm not lazy I'm trying, please I just want to be a person again. 

If you read all that, thank your for taking the time to it really means a lot to me. It's hard for me to type this out and even harder for me to hit the post button. Sorry for getting pretty emotional towards the end and also for any grammatical errors English is my second language.

I've been looking at myself and trying to figure out why I am a wreck. A procrastinating, depressed wreck. And I figured it out.

"Maybe this post belongs in r/anxiety; I'm not quite sure. I do know that lately I've had this feeling that, on several occasions, has made me quite literally sick to my stomach. It's very hard to describe.

See, I recently turned 18. I'm graduating high school a semester early with a fairly low GPA (2.7 weighted) despite my myriad veritable academic interests because I have this overwhelming boredom and this feeling that nothing is happening when I'm there. This nothingness has grown increasingly pervasive in my life.

I want to go to college but feel it is not in my best interest at the moment. I want to take a year off and work but am worried a year might turn into a lifetime of dead-end jobs and complacency. I want sometimes to pass my house in my Jeep and keep driving. But what would that solve?

I guess what I'm getting at is that I have no direction at the moment and nothing is calling me particularly loudly. I don't know where to go or what to do. I often find my eyes welling up and my fingers tapping my quivering leg with a sense of urgency, but alas I am still sitting. This yearning to do, to live, to experience coupled with my indistinct, unguided future, has birthed an uneasiness, a tension, that I haven't been able to relieve. 

Thank you for taking the time.

"Good day everyone!

I have decided to write my story here, since it seems that there might be some people here who might relate to me and maybe give insight.

TLDR: I am a 25 year old male who is enjoying his life, but constantly feels that he is doing more negative than positive things day-to-day in his life.

So going back to the story. As said above in the TLDR i have this weird feeling that i am doing more negative things in my life than positive things day-to-day and i can't seem to shake it off. Let me clarify that feeling, every day when i wake up i feel i am doing more things I DON'T WANT TO DO and LESS THINGS I WANT TO DO! No i am not depressed (at least i think i am not), no i am not sad, but this feeling makes me empty. It all started when i went to college for Bachelors degree. Before that everything seemed fine and i was doing more positive things in life than negative ones. My Bachelors degree went smoothly, i got the degree, i got a decent job (above average pay where i live), i wen't on to Masters degree and from the get go (starting from Bachelors degree) i have this urgency, that i do more things i don't want to do day-to-day and i get no pleasure from it.

Let me bring you an example. I wake up, i go to work. This part i enjoy. Now everything falls apart after work. I have to do this Masters degree and i feel like this is a complete and utter chore to do. Although everyone expect that i must finish this, so i have this pressure on me, that i have to finish this and i want to, but i feel like i am a prison in my own jail. I would gladly workout or hangout with friends, but i can't because from the morning to evening i am at work and after evening till night (sometimes even to 02:00 or 03:00) i do school stuff. I have already burned out once before (where i failed hard on some assignments) and i decided to take less workload. Still i feel like i am always overwhelmed and i can't seem to find free time to be who i want to be, but rather i feel like i have to complete these chores.

Then there is this another thing. I don't get enough respect from others although when problems arise, everyone are running to me for help. For an example, i am an engineer and the university where i am is expanding in the field where i work. I offered my help for anything the answer was ""You should get more experience before offering help"" from the director. After that i was quite confused, because i have been working on my speciality for over 3 years, i have a Bachelors degree, i am looking forward for my Masters degree and when i offer a friendly helping hand i get scolded for no apparent reason. Also when they need some materials from the workplace i work for, then everyone are running for me to ask help.

This helping is expanding to other things as well in life. When my friends are in need of help (lending money or anything else) then everyone are running to me, but i get no credit for it. For one friend i helped him to get a great job opening through my connections and then he was ""Yeah man, thanks for helping me, i will throw you a party"" of course this party never happened and i never got a thanks for it, rather that just thank you and goodbye.

Also at workplace i often get the same ""Disrespect"" treatment from older engineers (since i am a young guy) then i also provide new ideas, new innovative approaches and i seem to never get any respect for it. I have brought new ideas which have improved some systems and then its like ""Well its obvious thanks for the help"", but sometimes i get scolded for no apparent reason like the same from the director. Is this like some kind of an age thing? I don't understand or am i just an idiot.

But the main thing although is this school thing, that some of my classmates who are not even working in their speciality full-time are going more to school and getting more praises like scholarships, director is happy with them and me who is working as a full-time engineer, gets scolded, gets said like ""Get more experience"" although others who have never worked in their speciality. Is this like some kind of an academid circle-jerk they are doing to me? No i am not a fricking loser loner nerd guy, i am quite a self confident guy, but this just makes me so angry that i provide the university materials and experience from my workplace and i get scolded for working and not being full-time academic student? How does this even be logical?

Oeh there are many more things which i could write, but i don't want to drag this out if anyone has any questions or wants to discuss, i would happily open up more.

Thank you,
I just wanted to write this out!",2,"feeling more negative than positive, doing masters ,get no pleasure,"
"Welp, here I am.  I dropped out of one of the best colleges in the country last semester because I had no motivation and couldn't focus on schoolwork for the life of me.  I planned to move back in w/ my parents and try to improve myself and eventually transfer to a new school, but I feel stuck.  It's already been a month and I've done nothing.  I have no idea what I want to do, no idea what I should do, and frankly I don't even want to do anything.  I can feel my parents getting restless, and they keep asking me what my plan is and all I can say is ""I don't know yet"".  I don't think they understand depression very well as they are always asking why I do nothing and poke fun at me for sitting around and playing video all day.  I know I should try to plan something, but it just feels like a unclimbable mountain ahead of me.

"A few months ago I was hired by a very well-known business. I had to leave my other job abruptly because this new job was paying my $15 an hour which is damn near double the amount I was making at my old job. 

I wanted to give my old job a two-weeks notice but I couldn't because the new job couldn't give me a proper state date then they finally told me it would be the following Monday which was three days later. It sucked but I had to tell my boss that I had to quit after the Saturday before. He knew that I was getting a new job so I didn't just spring this on him. I hated telling him I had to start on Monday.

Monday rolls around and the new job tells me they don't need me until a week later. I didn't have my old job to go back to since they had already taken me out of the system. So yay, I was screwed out of a weeks pay. 

I finally did get to work the following week. Now, I don't have a car of my own. New job said they would work with me and either pick me up from my home or have me walk a few blocks to be picked up. Since November I have only worked a total of two weeks. I don't have a car to just drive around and look for jobs nor do I have a friend that can drive me around (I don't even know what a friend is anymore). 

New job hasn't had any work for me for the past two weeks and they are saying they are keeping us till the 13th. I have a phone bill I have to pay in a few weeks plus give my roommate rent. He also works for new job and is also having a hard time as well since he has no car.

I simply do not have the money to buy a car or even a down payment. I wish I knew what to do or where to go. I can't help but once again think about the life I had before last June. I had a family, a car and a wife. I still have a bit of resentment towards her because when she left me she want to her parents and they immediately helped her get a car. We lost our old car because we were behind on payments and I was borrowing a car from a friend of her family until she left then they guy suddenly needed it back...

I'm just super worried about everything. I don't have a single way out of this house. I feel like this is my prison. I'm here with roommates who all they want to do is get high (I have no problems with smoking by the way) and play video games. I enjoy gaming myself, but I don't want that to just be my life. I hate it here. I wish I knew of something to do or where to go. I wish a someone would talk to me or listen. I wish someone was concerned about my life. I miss having friends who cared.

"I've hated school all my life, but I did my best to get good grades and finish because I thought I could finally be free once I graduate. After graduating, I thought life would finally start being fun and enjoyable, I had worked so hard to finally be over with it and I was full of dreams and motivation. Fast forward 2 years later, I tried everything I could, from starting my own business to working at a restaurant, working in software development job (I graduated in Computer Science), working as a guide, acting, and every time it's the same, I end up hating my job and my life and quit. At this point I feel like I've lost all my motivation to do anything, I don't know what I want to do and no matter how much I look for a passion I can't find one. I'm currently employed and I hate my job, just thinking about it makes me want to kill myself. Everybody thinks I'm doing great because I go to the gym, learn foreign languages, play music, got good grades at school, but work makes me so fucking depressed that all I can think of is ending everything. I love to learn languages but that doesn't make any money, translation makes money but I hate it and want to kill myself just thinking about it. I love watching anime, listening to music, playing music, eating good food, seeing a nice scenery, but none of that makes money, and with no money I'm homeless, and I'd rather die than be homeless, but working makes me want to kill myself. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on how you look at it, I have a good family who I most definitely do not want to harm and thus suicide is absolutely out of the question, I could never forgive myself if I went through with it. So here I am, hating my life and wanting to kill myself every day but unable to do so because I do not want to cause harm to my family. It's like I'm in jail although I'm perfectly healthy (at least physically) and free (in theory). I just wish I was never born, I wouldn't be in this situation and everything would be so much easier. It seems like no matter which direction I step in, it sucks. So then I look towards suicide, but even that sucks.

Yesterday I googled something that vaguely described how I felt and landed on [this page](http://www.getesteem.com/lse-symptoms/symptom-details.html) and it resonated so hard with me I broke down into tears. I feel like a mess.

"Hi everyone,
I've been lurking on this reddit for a couple of months now, on and off, depending on my mood. It's always been uplifting to read the responses to the posts.

The context of my problem is that I'll be looking for an internship in April of this year (my very first job), and I'm unsure if I can match up to the competition and impress a potential employer.

However, that isn't what I wanted help with. My problem is that when I think about my prospects, I have attacks of what I'm pretty sure is called ""anticipatory"" anxiety, ranging from vague feelings of discomfort to hyperventilating panic attacks, almost always followed by a period of intense depressed lethargy where I am unable to do anything but stare at the ceiling and feel shitty about myself. This can last for anytime between 2-3 hours to a whole day.

Needless to say, this is seriously hampering my productivity, and I'd like to ask about the r/depression community if they've ever experienced anything similar and what they've done to avoid or subdue these feelings of hopelessness and anxiety.

Thanks in advance!

"Moving back home isn't an option. I won't be able to get and hold a job for much the same reason I can't graduate - an inability to be among others for any notable amount of time. I had hoped to get a stay at home job upon graduating, but without a degree that possibility is closed to me.

I have roughly $20k to my name and my expenses are minimal. All I want is to keep to myself and not constantly worry about food and shelter, but I know nothing about essentials such as cooking or apartment searching.

Is there any hope that I'm not seeing or do I only have a year left to live?",2,"moving back home isnt an option, cant gradute therefore cant get a job, dont want to worry about essentials"
"I recently (6 months ago) finally got a job after over a year of unemployment but im working huge hours and 6 days a week. Not only that, its a stressful job too. I find my self already not getting out of bed when my alarm wakes me up and considering just not going in ever again. I'm just wasting my time on facebook, youtube and reddit instead of doing productive things or even consuming media that enriches me. I dont want to stop working because i can finally afford to go places with my friends when i have time and i can finally buy things that i like and can pursue hobbies that in the past i couldn't afford too. Its not that im not making enough money, i could still do all this on a part time job but its been impossible for me to find one. I just have no idea what im doing, i feel my self slipping back into the attitude of helplessness, indifference and guilt toward my own life that not two years ago had me in a serious rut where my health and opportunity just wasted away, i finaly have the chance to live my life and i can feel all motivation to strive to enjoy it slipping out of my grasp every passing day.",2,"got a job after 6 months of unemployment, , stressful, dont want to stop working for money"
"If you want to read more about my recent troubles, here is the previous thread I made about 2 weeks ago:
https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5jquj6/i_failed_another_college_class_and_i_dont_know/

But basically I am 23 years old and a computer science major and I have recently just failed another semester of college and told my mother about it. She was disappointed in me and really expressed her disappointment in me.

Whenever I don't distract myself with video games or watching tv I feel miserable about my life and reflect about how much of a failure I think I am. I usually get thoughts about what I would've done differently if I could turn back time and get a sort of existential crisis. 

Sometimes I feel motivated in the morning to improve my life and that I would build up on my resume by trying to learn a new programming language or by working on an app or some coding project I can put on my portfolio but whenever I get stuck I end up losing my will to continue and go back to having my existential crisis.

I have tried following a daily schedule and deleting the games I play on my computer but I end up still distracting myself with other things.

Is there a way to just power through life? I keep telling myself that life gets better and that in the future I'll get married and start my own family and will be happy. But whenever I take some time to think about it I don't really know if its worth it. 

Thanks for reading.",2,"failed another semester, mother disappointed in me, distract self with video games, lack of motivation, existential crisis"
"I'm 18 male and am confused about my situation... Im a senior at highschool and Im very unmotivated to even try and study but I do want to succeed. I'm quite a fail socially and everyonr probably sees me as someone who is incredibly stupid or a low achieving troublemaker which I do not want as an image for myself.. I am not dumb or I dont think I am.. I can be getting good grades if I put a little effort into studying but Im just not motivated.. I would find anything to do except paying attention in class like drawing or writing lyrics or even plain sleeping.
I find myself hating myself on daily basis wondering if this is my personality or is it genes or what if its how I was brought up?
I do not know the answer to this yet. 
Please help me find out if I am depressed..
Although now that I wrote all of this. I think I have been depressed but in denial that is why I do not seem much depressed but I have thought of suicide before and now I still want to die but I dont want to suicide. Lately though, I have considered self-harm as a second plan for not wanting to suicide so idk..
Please dont redirect me to /r/suicidewatch that place is depressing",2," senior at high school, very unmotivated,everyone sees me as incredibly studpid, I am not dumb, not motivated"
"I've had literal months to finish these two assignments for college (UK college, I'm 17, doing a fashion design course) and I've barely started due to a mixture of depressed feelings and fear of getting the work wrong and being thought of as an idiot. I was given an extension for one of them which was due before the christmas holidays but my tutor gave me until we go back for the new term, which is tomorrow. I haven't touched my sketchbook for the whole christmas holiday and I hate myself. I don't know if it was *because* it was christmas or if it just happened but I have felt like utter shit for the past few weeks. Maybe its because I'm falling behind in my work, but all I want to do is kill myself most of the time and that's not an exaggeration at all. 

I have two assignments due tomorrow, one that I've had an extension on already for the same reason, and I have to go in and explain why I haven't completed it again. I'm literally shitting myself about having to ask for more special treatment because of my fucking head not working properly. Plus I don't know how he'll react, like what if he says its fine but secretly thinks I'm just milking it to get more time for my work? What if he believes me but decides I'm not mentally capable of staying on the course? Not to mention the huge fear I have that he'll just blow up at me, which I highly doubt is going to happen because he's a very nice person, but I still worry about stuff like that. 

Thanks for reading this anyone, advice would be amazing right now. :3 ",2,"given 2 assignemts, scared of failing, being given an assignment, head not working properly, cant complete the task worried , anxious , depressed"
"I have just moved in with my gf in December, graduated a year ago and have begun working in a company. The company's a successful growth company.

I have liked to work there, but there are some problems. I had a conversation with my bosses about my performance, and they said that they're not sure if I will get to continue there after the test period.

I don't mind criticism, I know I can do better, but f.ex. right now I've been in a flu for about 3 weeks, and my boss has suggested that I shouldn't have a day off even though I would feel like it.

Everything about this situation makes me feel pressurised, and I wake up every morning feeling reluctant to go to work. It's not nice to feel like every day matters at work, when normal routines are starting to feel like effort.

When I get home from work, I usually just slob on the couch and watch comedies or other funny videos to feel better. I sleep quite ok, could do with a few more hours.

I'm grateful to have gotten an opportunity to work in such a successful company. After all, in these times, even getting work is not certain.

I have been depressed before. At that time, I was just 18 and trying to figure out what the hell was I doing. Ended up quitting my job then.

Tl;dr: I work at a successful place, just moved in with gf. Felling pressure to do more at work, and at the same time feeling I should have time with myself. Would appreciate tips on how to get over this feeling.

"Does anyone else have an issue of your depression turning you towards bad habit and behaviors that prohibit growth healing and success?

I feel like every few months I have an episode and I act out, I start being late for work or calling in more, feeling like they won't fire me or if they do who cares I can get other jobs. It's like the depression messes with anything that actually goes good in my life. I've had past relationships ruined, jobs, family ties.
