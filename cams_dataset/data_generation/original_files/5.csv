"Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I've only now understood the fact that I've socially isolated myself over the last 5 years.  Growing up I played premier soccer on one of the best teams in my state, but quit when I was 15 after making the academy team, a decision I've come to regret. I remained athletic and played for less competitive teams afterward just to have fun with friends and help them improve their play.  By senior year in highschool, I had dropped all athletics and after school clubs.  I didn't have my drivers license or a car, so I mostly stayed at home at night.  During school I ignore my long time friends with the excuse of getting ahead on homework, but when I got home all I would do is play video games, watch random documentaries on youtube, research random shit, try to write stories, and a bunch of other random things that never amounted to anything.
I graduated with no friends.

After highschool I went to college and immediately connected with my roommates.  I became really good friends with one of them that I later seperated from because he did not like partaking in smoking weed, even though he was accepting of it, I distanced myself because I didn't want to involve him in it.  But this indirectly lost me my best friend in college.  I never went out to parties that the frats through, I'd always give some BS excuse not to go, partly because I was scared of getting an underage drinking infraction and losing my license, partly because I didn't want to socialize.  Despite me turning down every party request, I'd still smoke with my friends in small groups, but large parties just made me so anxious.  As time went on, I slowly started seperating from those friends though as well because I kept turning down their invites, not just to parties but to do anything.  It became a repeat of highschool, but it started in my second year rather than my senior year.
I dropped out of college.

College wasn't making me happy, my intended major was biochem (which really interests me even to this day), but the loads of work, lack of friends, and helplessness got me.  I would spend most of my nights crying myself to sleep locked in my dorm room feeling helpless and had nobody to consult.  My grades started slipping once my depressive episodes started lasting whole days at a time where I wouldn't even leave my room to shower or eat, I just kept myself busy playing video games or staring at my wall.  At this point in time I started smoking again to try to help bring myself out of it, but it became too much of a crutch.  I was smoking a little over a quarter ounce every 3-4 days (about 80 USD, 7-10 blunts worth for those who don't smoke).
This is why i dropped out of college, because I didn't want to waste the money until I fixed myself.

This is when my social isolation started.  I had no remaining friends from highschool I kept in touch with, and lost all of my college friends because I would just ignore their messages and say ""Sorry man i got ur message too late"" or ""Sorry man I'm busy tonight with (insert bullshit excuse)"".  Luckily I've gotten my depression under somewhat better control, although there are times where I still can't control them or recenter myself.  But really what it's done is make me feel inadequate.  After months of thinking about it, I think the root of it is that I have nothing fulfilling in life.  I think since I quite soccer, I've never had anything to immerse myself with, I can't find that thing to get me up in the mornings.  I literally snooze my alarm for 1-2 hours a day because I hate waking up...

I guess what I'm really asking is how do I find fulfillment in a life where I feel inadequate at everything I do.  Coupled with that, I've seem to become very socially anxious.

Some other stuff to include to give you guys a full picture, I work as a cashier.  Almost every one of customers loves me because I have such a cheery attitude (I think the reason I'm ok with this is because the conversations i have are familiar, almost routine).  I am the kind of guy to give you the shirt off my back if it'll help u, but wont take a handout if I'm starving.

I have plans to hike the Appalachian Trail (full thru-hike) once i pay off my remaining student debt because I thought that it would help me more than anything to just bring my life back to the basics, food and shelter.  The only activity I do is hiking really, even that I do alone and now that it's winter it's much more uncomfortable.

Any advice is welcome.  Thank you~",5,"social isolation,no friends  college drop out,,no friends,playing video games all the time"
"Like right now. Just sitting here back in my home town during the holidays. Still fighting wicked depression and anxiety, and having to fly back across country in two weeks. 

Just sitting here alone at the kitchen table listening to some Linkin Park style music, sipping on a Stella and I realized how often I get caught in this daze and how I almost enjoy it. 

Like Iâm allowing the pain in. Soaking in it. The music obviously amplifies it. 

I think about the decisions Iâve made that have caused me greater pain. More stress. 

I think about what my future holds. If I can make it until then.

I think about the present. If Iâm meeting everyoneâs standards that they all know of me.

Think, think and more thinking. Sometimes mixed with tears. Sometimes angers. But always with self loathing.

Then I go to bed. Sometimes feeling better. Sometimes worse. Itâs a wicked, and vicious fucking cycle.

Iâm so tired. Speaking in general of course about life.

"I can't stand to do anything else. I always have to distract myself with these fantasy worlds. I hate everything else. I hate being alive. I want to kill myself. I can't bear to do this anymore. My life is just one distraction after another. Everything else makes me too anxious. Too many wasted opportunities, too much wasted time, and too much bullshit in my past to make my future at all worthwhile. I feel so trapped.

"Seriously, just what is the point in living? I can't understand why we're all supposed to live a long life, and why the hell does anyone genuinely enjoy being alive? It just seems like everything you do is just fucking around until you die. Nothing really matters. Like all there is in life is just trying not to be miserable and one day you die. Who gives a fuck if it's at 80 or at 20, it doesn't matter. I've come to accept that I'm never going to kill myself, but what the fuck is the point if all I'm doing is just waiting to die anyway? Get a decent career or live your whole life unemployed and homeless, the end result is the same. I just can't seem to justify trying to enjoy life when all there is at the end is the same no matter what the fuck I do. It seems like everyone's reasons for why you shouldn't kill yourself revolve around the people around you: if you kill yourself you'll make other people sad. But who the hell cares? All the people who'll be sad you're gone are going to die sooner or later anyway. It's all so fucking pointless. I just don't enjoy anything this world has to offer. All the earthly pleasures everyone else seem to enjoy just do absolutely nothing for me. I can't find any reason as to why I should even bother. Life isn't beautiful, it's full of hardship, disappointment and misery. And then you fucking die anyway. Even if the bad times are really as temporary as everyone says, so are the good times. What's the fucking point? Every day is just the same fucking thing over and over and over and over until one day you physically can't keep doing the same thing and you die. How the fuck is there any reason why anyone shouldn't just give up? I'm literally only still here because the idea of surviving a suicide attempt sounds worse than just suffering through another boring day of the same pointless shit. There's no light at the end of the tunnel, unless you see death as a ""light"" and even then, you're just suffering for nothing because you could just end it all today and it wouldn't make any fucking difference. The whole concept of survival just seems so fucking stupid because all we're doing is just delaying the inevitable, whether we're talking about the species as a whole or just one particular individual. What's the fucking point in staying alive? I just don't understand.",5,"what is the point in living, I just dont enjoy anything  "
"I guess this isnât really a stereotype, but I often see depressed people in movies/shows/etc portrayed as a person fighting their depression alone, meanwhile trying to make everyone else in their life happy so theyâll never experience that sadness. 


But ever since Iâve been depressed (roughly 5 years now) Iâve been the most cynical person. I hate other peopleâs happiness, when someone accomplishes something all I do is think about my failures. I obviously am outwardly supportive, but inside Iâm so resentful. I feel like am truly an awful person, I donât remember the last time I was genuinely happy for someone. I really just cannot connect with people on any emotional level anymore. I just feel like alien.


Does anyone else feel this way? Or do you try to make other people happy to make up for you not being happy yourself? Does this help you, as in does other peopleâs happiness help to alleviate yours slightly? 


&amp; also, to people that donât resent other peopleâs happiness, how? All I can think about is how unfair it is that others can be so happy when Iâm hardly staying afloat


I know Iâm asking 100 questions but Iâm just curious as to how people share a common disorder but respond to it in very different ways ",5,"been the most cynical person, hate other peoples hapiness , when someone accomplishes something all I do is think about my failures."
"I've been in one of those disassociation periods for months now. I just checked the group chat that I now leave muted and I couldn't think of many things worse than a night out of regulated happiness, with the countdown, that awful song and people who actually want to go into 2018, with their aspirations and shit. 

Well, one thing worse would be staying home to watch millions of pounds/euros/dollars/whatever being absolutely spunked away on fireworks, right overhead of the poverty/homelessness stricken major cities of the world. How anyone enjoys those things is beyond me. You've gotta feel bad for the animals too, domesticated and wild...

"It's totally arbitrary, and that really isn't a problem (any made-up reason to celebrate is fine) except that it makes me think about how miserable I was last New Year's, and every year as far back as I can remember - which is something I would never otherwise think about.

What's worse, it marks another year during which I was totally miserable.  Every New Year's Eve, I am made to reflect that I felt just as bad over the last year as I did the year before, often worse.

"I know I've probably said this countless times before, but fuck, when I think about the way that I act and speak I just get filled with this hatred and hopelessness. I can't stand myself, I don't know why I'm like this but I'm a god awful person to be around. 

I can't keep up a conversation to save my life, it seems like no matter what I'm just repulsive in every way. Nobody wants to talk to me for more than a few minutes, the amount of times I've been left ""on read"" as the cool kids say, is too many to count. I don't know what I'm doing wrong but at the same time I'm painfully aware of how awkward, unfunny, negative and all around incomprehensible I am. I can barely string together a coherent sentence.

It's like every time I try to talk to someone my mind just blanks and I don't know how to reply, no matter how much time I spend forming my response it's always hard to read trash. I can't do anything right, I'm mean, sarcastic, unfunny, awkward and just plain stupid with an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the worst time. 

I'm just so hopeless, I'm so tired of being me and living with this irredeemable trash pile for a brain. It feels like there's nothing I can do to change or improve, no matter what I'll always be this rude sack of shit that's hated almost universally by everyone around them.

"When i lived in the states, i had no healthcare so if i wanted anti depressants and counselling, i had to pay out of pocket. i was 15 when i was diagnosed. my mom was working overtime to support me and my two younger siblings, there was no way she could afford mental health help on her own and she made that clear to me. Now that i live in kenya the mental health resources are even more strained and the stigma is worse for seeking them. when i try to talk to people about how i'm feeling they either make me feel worse or tell me they're sorry cause they don't know what to say. and why should they? none of them are licensed therapists. i'm at a point where i need intense professional help but can't get it so my best bet is to do whatever makes me feel better, no matter how harmful it actually is.

"Depression functions in a way where our percieved ""rock bottom"" always happened somewhere in the past month. The truth is, depression gets worse overtime. That rock bottom that people claim to hit is just an illusion. You are depressed for ten months, feel like you are over it for one month, then sink. You keep sinking farther down into the earth until you reach fucking hell. You keep getting lonelier until  you start getting confused whether you're saying stuff in your head or out loud. You grow to be more disgusted by yourself. Your ugly face, your ugly mind, all your fucking failures, and your stupid fucking ego. You feel more and more guilty, regretting every fucking desicion that you make that makes you the stupid failure that you are. You start to cry so much that you can't cry anymore. Soon people don't help your loneliness, compliments don't cure your disgust for yourself, and success doesn't cure your guilt. And the funny thing is, even that isn't rock bottom.

"I'll just try to make it short (and fail trying) My problem isn't worth really mentioning, I'm a privileged little shit that doesn't have it nearly as bad as most folks here, I even have a supporting girlfriend from a long distance who is also very anxious and depressed. But it helps a little to write it out somewhere. I've graduated from high school around nearly 3 years ago at this point. I'm 20 years old, highly anxious and I've always felt like a dissapointment to my family in every single way imaginable. I barely passed high school, and I hated myself for falling behind and ever since then it's been going down hill with me feeling like a piece of shit for not being where everyone else is. I didn't apply for any colleges right after high school, I didn't make any plans, for some reason I felt like my life was going to be over after high school. I was never thinking about the future but more so the next day. I put off working for quite some time. The thought of standing there socializing or handling money gets my nerves all riled up so I put it off. My parents weren't gonna pay or help pay for a local college so I was kinda stuck here just deciding to do nothing. I don't know why but it just felt pointless. I don't know what I wanna do for the rest of my life, I don't know if what I wanna do is gonna matter. I'm still gonna be a piece of shit that always makes the wrong choices so what's the point? I don't know it sounds pathetic but I don't know.

I lost most of my friends in this time frame, mostly because I cut contact with them because I was so ashamed of myself for doing nothing even though I had all the means to do something while they were going to school and doing what they were supposed to do. I was running out of excuses as to why I'm not doing anything. So two years go by like this, I numb myself with video games and don't answer any calls. I sit in my room all day every day and do nothing and try not to think about it. Sorry this is all over the place, there was someone I met that I unwillingly became friends with but ended up breaking the friendship with her sometime after her mother died. That left me feeling like a selfish piece of shit for quite some time, to fake being a friend. Also left me feeling incredibly guilty because said person needed support after her mother passed and I was just sitting here being a dick. 

I don't know. I can't get myself to do anything worth while. I get overwhelmed easily and I don't have the energy to jump start everything. The future looks so bleak and empty. Like fuck I can't imagine being 30 years old and still in this position. With each passing day I do nothing, the more I feel like a piece of shit. I don't know where to start. I get too anxious undergoing basic social interactions, getting a haircut feels like a nightmare since I'm infront of so many people and I'm absolutely petrified of running into the people I isolated from. I don't know, I've given myself ultimatums in the past. Last year I told myself if nothing changed by the end of the year then I'd have to go to the military but I didn't end up doing that. I'm just tired of it. It's like an endless cycle. I go out there, try to do something  realize I won't be able to stop working for the rest of my life and have to face the responsibilities of being an adult with so much social interaction and painful weeks. Or I do nothing about it, stay at home and don't be an adult and hate myself over doing nothing about my current situation. It felt good back then having a due date. With the military option back in 2016 it atleast made me feel at ease that I could die if things got too bad. Feels like I'm backing myself into a wall here. I can't do another year of this. I can't turn 21 and still not change, I feel like I'm gonna be like this for the rest of my life. Nothing I do is ever gonna have any kind of meaning either. It's getting harder and harder to find a good reason to live if not for other people. It's not going to get better I'm not gonna change because deep down all my problems come from me and I can't not be me. So it's fucked, I'm what's wrong with my life. Why should I live with that for 60 more years?",5,"hated myself for falling behind, do nothing, overwhelmed easily future looks so bleak and empty, anxious undergoing basic social interactions"
"People are starting try and understand depression a little. But the empathy just is not there for anxiety and ADHD. 

I wish things were halfway as easy as neurotypical people think. 

All people see when they look at me is a lazy failure. Most days that's all I believe about myself. 

I think when people say they want to help and support people who struggle with mental illness and disorders, what they really want is for us to shut up and quietly suffer so they don't have to think about it or see it anymore. 

I talked to a counselor at my university the other day. She didn't pay attention to a single thing I said and only wanted to verify that I wouldn't kill myself. As long as I don't stain the university's reputation it doesn't matter if my quality of life is shit and I end up killing myself after leaving college.",5," lazy failure, quietly suffer,that's all I believe about myself"
"I seriously think not. I feel like people only talk to be if they either don't want me to kill myself or they want something from me. 

For instance I recently got a boyfriend, and he's totally different than who he used to be. We used to be friends for a long time but lately all he wants to talk about it either sex, or the whole ""hey don't cut yourself, there's people who care, kisses!"". Everytime he talks about us hanging out it's about sex, or doing something sexual, and then when we do hang out that's also all he wants to do, and I just feel like he doesn't want to be in a relationship or he even actually likes me, he just wants sex and I'm easy. The rest the time it's like our conversations are some copy pasta crap about how you shouldn't cut or kill yourself. Like it used to be different we used to have actual conversations and now it seems unless there's another person there our real conversations are far and few between. 

Then there's my 'friends' who play games with me online. I'm pretty sure that's the only reason we even talk. I suck ass at fps so half the time I just make the game worse and honestly I can not fathom a single reason why they want be around, even my commentary is just me being annyoing as fuck while I let every one down. I think they just don't want to play alone, because that seems like the only reason I ever get invited to play and honestly I don't blame any of them. Or because they don't want me to kill myself, because the two that invite me to play the most are the two that know.

I seriously just want to kill myself, I honestly think it will be better for everyone, people wouldn't have to pretend to like me, they wouldn't have to suffer through be annoying them, it would be great for me too since I just hate myself so much because I'm such a fucking shit head. But I won't, because I'm a fucking pussy and I won't do it until I get the courage to do it again, and this time I won't fuck it up

"I don't know how to preface this. I guess, maybe, that I don't understand, and I am not understood. This is really shameless of me, to post. But here goes nothing.

Isolation plagues me, like, cancer plagues a person. I'm not comparing the grimness, cancer is terrible. But, I am comparing, how it's impossible to truly get rid of. Or at the very least, very very hard.

You see, communication, to me, is like trying to draw. In what way? Well, imagine you're drawing a wolf, but you're not good at drawing. So you think of a design, and in your head it works out, it looks amazing! Then, as soon as you go to put it on paper, it all falls apart and you end up crumpling the paper and trashing it.

Imagine, like that, but with vocal conversation. This is like, a giant wall, between me and anyone else. Nobody can get close to me. I can't get close to anyone. Nobody can even see me. I'm like a radio station broadcasting into the abyss.

*That's just who I am.* Nothing will fix that. So, I'm doomed, to loneliness and isolation. So is the way of life.

Not many people know what it's like to be that isolated. To be an alien among humans, to be, what seems like, the last of your kind. Everyone rejects you, because it's clear, you're not human. Your movements, the way you compose yourself, people can *JUST TELL*. And they avoid you. It's terrible, people get mad at you, scapegoat you, and you can't defend yourself on your own.

Since I was born, this is how it's been. The terror of a nightmare I once had, has slowly become an everyday thing. I'll attempt to explain the nightmare.

Here it goes : I was walking down a hallway. I was hit by sadness, isolation, stress. Not unusual. But then someone says something that throws me over the edge. I want to scream. I try to scream. I'm screaming. But there is no sound. I try to punch everything around me, and every punch lands featherlight, as if there was no intent behind it. I can't blow off anything, it's just fuming inside of me. I collapse hysterically crying(yet, not making a sound, even if I tried) and i awake with wet eyes.

It's the most terrifying nightmare I've ever had, yet, eerily reminiscent and metaphorical of exactly how I feel. Voiceless... It's so bad, I can't explain the isolation, I can't explain the loneliness, being someone so cold, yet, with so much to share, but you can't share it, and nobody will share with you. It's not fun, it's terrible, it's so bad and it's not something that can be fixed. It consumes me every single day.

It's not *just* the depression speaking. Legitimately, I have no chance of ever properly communicating. Do you know how that feels? Does anyone know how that feels? I'm sure they do, but that doesn't make it easier.

It's a stabbing pain, when, even people you've grown up with your whole life, you're not connected with. My mother means literally nothing to me. Nobody means anything to me, and I WISH THEY DID. God, I WISH THEY DID. It's hardddd though, I can't explain it. I'm trapped in a bunker nobody can penetrate. Nobody even knows I'm in here, so why would they try? They just assume that I am the cold, heartless, stone walls that encase me.

I could never explain it. That's what hurts so bad. The headaches, the pain. It's unbearable. I frequently dream about just shooting up a ludicrous amount of heroin and drifting into an endless sleep.

I don't want to live anymore, I want to be on the moon, where I belong. Maybe, just maybe, I'll be there soon. And I'll be sad for never.

Everyone has a sense of loneliness at some point, a yearning for belonging. For me, these are two facts of life, not temporary situations, just due to who I am. That's what hurts the most. Even if I  wanted something different, and I DO I DO, I could never fucking have it. It's so bad, its terrible, it's undefeatable.

It's not just a temporary state. Don't tell me ""it'll pass"". No it fucking won't, I'm not just saying that. It literally won't pass. It's not ""The depression speaking"". It is *LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE SHRED OF WHO I AM*. And nobody, will ever try to break through those grim walls. I'm just an emotionless enigma to them, people just accept it. I want to leave this lonely place. But I can't. It's a curse, an everlasting curse I will carry to the grave.

"I'm a 20 year-old female. I've been having depression for the last 5 years, with a peak in my 15-16. I used to cut myself, but then my parents found out about it and, seeing their horrified expression and how they handled it, I promised not to do it again. They helped me out though. I finished college and got into university, but still I was pretty depressed and had a few guys in my romantic life. Last year I met this wonderful guy who is my actual boyfriend. He's loving, caring, sweet and very in love with me. I couldn't really ask for more: i have a family, I'm pretty good at uni, have a boyfriend and everything. But still, my demons keep haunting me. I know it sounds horrible to say, but I really wish I was dead. I don't know, I see the bad in everything: i hate myself, i don't like my body even though many boys told me i'm beautiful, i wanna cut again, i hate how i am, my voice, my hands, my legs, my hair, my shyness, my behaviuor, my life. But I can't take it away, since this many people love me.. And I feel bad just by imagining how harsh it'd be for them to know about my death.
I can't cope with these thoughts that seem only to get stronger lately, I feel it even more when I'm stressed and the minimum stupid bad thing that happens or that is said to me makes me suicidal. Like really, I'd really want to jump off somewhere really high.
I can't go to a psychiatrist, since I hate being a burden to anyone. My parents, at the time, suggested me to go to a psychologist, but i didn't want to, because I feel like a burden (economically too) and my mum would have taken every chance to face it to me (like: wow, here talks the crazy girl). So yeah. I seriously don't know what to do, talking about it to someone isn't a good idea to me since my boyfriend thinks I'm out of this, my best friend is now seeing a girl and likes her and i don't wanna ruin it, and then I don't have any other friends. i think I wouldn't wanna talk to anyone in any case actually. So here I am. I wrote this even in the hope to see if someone is in the same situation I am in, not necessarily to get help. Thank you for reading.",5,"burden to anyone, cut myself,makes me suicidal"
"Okay, I know that depression is subjective. My âsadâ is not your âsadâ. But we can agree that it is kind of one of the suckiest feelings you can get. So if you are already at this low point where it canât get any better by itself. Wouldnât that make anything that usually have a high risk, feels small? Am I the only one here who gets the sense of rush and power to do things that I wouldnât be able to do if I was feeling normal?

Doesnât work with everything, I know that. Also, with severe depression I would still suggest seeking real help. But I cannot help but to acknowledge this channeling of feeling into power.",5,"suckiest feelings, low point"
"Ever since I've become depressed, I've come to realize that my negative outlook on life is just realistic and that every thing is basically materialistic shit, which doesn't really matter. I feel like depression makes you more smart in a logical sense.

"I have never been diagnosed with depression, although my girlfriend has. She frequently has periods of extremely low moods that can go on for days or even weeks, and has attempted suicide in the past. 

Whenever I see her like this it eats me apart from the inside with guilt, because I feel like it's my responsibility to help her and make her feel better and when I can't I feel like shit. I feel like a failure whenever this happens and I don't know what to do.

Does anyone here know what to do? Or how to help? I hate watching this happen to her and I feel so guilty.

"I'm a 20 year old college student guy who's never had a relationship before. Not even a kiss or held a girl's hand before. No one has ever shown interest in me before and I put myself out there online and irl. Tinder and OKCupid are dead ends, I've been on 9 first dates and 0 second dates, not to mention barely any matches on either. I'm not even being creepy, desperate, or too forward on them either, I'm just being myself. 

I often ask if people on reddit would be willing to go out with me HYPOTHETICALLY if I asked them out. Most said 'no' because I'm not their type, which I mean again, indicates that I'm no one's type. I mean, what can I do then? Am I really datable and boyfriend material?

I try to work on myself as much as I can, I go to the gym consistently and I'm in decent shape, try to take care of my appearance and dress nicely, get good grades in my classes, have a high-paying internship that pays more than some full-time college grads. I try to put myself out there and try different hobbies but I also shelter myself a little with video games. But overall, is that not enough?

People say that I'm not ugly but what does that mean? Are people blowing smoke up my ass? People say I'm just average-looking, which means that if I didn't try to put in effort, I would be ugly. I'm only average-height too, which kinda sucks. Here's me: https://imgur.com/a/6j6Zc

Average-looking, undatable, don't fit anyone's mold, perfect for no one.

What else do I have to be then? How do other people who are severely depressed or anxious get into relationships? When is it my turn? How do you feel about me? Would you hypothetically date me and why not? If you're a woman, I appreciate your input with a lot of value, whatever it is that you're gonna say.",5,"never had a relationship,just average-looking undatable, don't fit anyone's mold, perfect for no one,"
"So in the past year i think i made a lot of progress forward, i got my own place, took control of everything in my life, found a new group of friends (i don't know how, i just did), reconnected with some old ones.

And finally i honestly felt like i built some proper confidence in my self (all the while keeping that dark side at bay).

New years rolls around, i spent most of NYE talking to a girl half of which was sober (a year ago, that was literally impossible), I've met her before through old friends, and honest to god i thought the my feelings toward her were basically love at first sight type deal, more i talk too her the more i like her....anyway so, whole night and i'm thinking maybe, just maybe i could start something with this girl (note, never had a girlfriend so this feeling is completely new and obviously terrible at signals, i interpreted everything as interest in me on her part.....).

Get to end of the night (at which point shes keen to grab couple more drinks elsewhere) and bang.......she rings her boyfriend.

Then changed her tone to ""i should probably head home"" and bailed (no doubt there were other hints and signals i just didn't get or pickup on, cause i suck at that, so i guess most of this is my own fault), and now, after walking the dark streets for a better part of an hour, im home, alone and feeling just utterly terrible, hating my self for being so blind too it all and worst part, i thought i really had found someone amazing on my birthday of all days......

"For some of us, 2017 sucked. Relationships, friends (or lack of), grades, lost loved ones - whatever it may be, maybe this year was garbage. 

Personally (22/M), I just spent my fifth consecutive New Years alone - sitting here wondering why I'm still incapable of making any notable friendships at what some people consider to be the best/easiest age to socialize and make friends. 

Despite that, I'm convinced that sitting here listening to the fireworks alone isn't all that life has to offer - and maybe a change in attitude/habits will help me next year. By extension, I sincerely hope everyone reading this will have a better 2018 in whatever aspect of life is holding you down.

Those of you who can actually wake up every morning and do something with their lives are some of the strongest and bravest people I have ever seen. At the end of the day weâre all different people dealing with the same exact problem, depression. I know I donât know any of you, but Iâm proud you fight your depression and Iâm so glad that youâre alive. Youâre all amazing people. Whether you see it or not.

"and it is becoming difficult to stay focused. There is a loss of interest in activities I typically enjoy, a growing desire to be around/talk with friends, yet the drive to isolate is developing a storm within myself.

I am in my thirties, many worries I had in my twenties are gone (job, housing, making friends). The struggle is in the remaining challenges. I value myself by how desirable I imagine I am. I define my desirability by how needed I am in mainly non-monetary ways (i.e. work doesn't really count, though it gives me some strength). Often I find more time on my hands than others, which leads me to reach out to friends much more than being reached out to instead. My friends and family say they enjoy spending time together and we make small talk about promises to connect. Many friends and family are actually busy and may only find time to connect infrequently. I can only see/share a snapshot of our lives and our connections. This makes me feel like less of a person. I want more people (two to three friends someday day) I connect with more than quarterly or annually. 

This has been a generally positive year. This lull has been much less severe than in prior years (during the holidays specifically). The sadness is more powerful in the duration and lack of attributable events. I want a reason to be sad, to fight or deconstruct said reason and ""bounce back"" or at least have an argument against these feelings. 

The hum of daily activities continues, heavy in each moment. A white noise that slowly is clouding my routine ushering me closer to the basics of eat, work, sleep, then repeat. The fog is comforting in the simplicity of the path left for me to travel, however the path is not the direction I want. 

I want to see around me again, I want to clearly view my challenges and triumphs, and most of all I want to feel desirable again. The time it takes to push through this cycle is exhausting. I wish to rid myself of this monotonous hum that is pushing me towards isolation.

I have no real expectations of improving my situation from posting, yet I am hopeful I might be distracted for a bit by sharing. It provides a sense of value to think what I say has an impact on myself or others.  

Thank you for taking the time to read this, it feels good to imagine I am being heard.

"I lived a carefree life and all my troubles seems so far away. Today it has been five years of coping with depression and truthfully I am just tired of it. There's no fixing it when you don't have the support and money to go through all the procedure in order to fix you. I need money to get through depression, I need job to get money, I need a stable life to get a job but there's no way to get a proper job when I am miserable day in and day out.

"It's kind of hard to describe. But every once in a while, it hits me harder than usual, where I'm just laying in bed all day, and everything of who I am Is gone. But I can vividly feel my 8 year-old self laying in bed with the exact same feeling, and my 11 year-old self and so on.
It's like a unified depression of all of pasts and futures combined. Like I somehow merge into one single being. And it's just a feeling of utter hopelessness. A feeling that everything is changing for the worse. The good things are all gone. All the people I loved are no longer the same people, or have just simply left my life forever. I see people like my parents and family ageing. People are getting married and having kids. Those kids are getting older. 
I feel like I want to die, and rid myself of this misery that I've experienced my entire life. And I've had a pretty good life, I really can't complain about anything. Other people have it a lot worse. 

I'm only 22, but I feel like I've somehow lived a hundred lifetimes. I used to be religious. Or at least I was forced to be religious. But I realize that even if God and heaven existed, I don't want to go to heaven. I'm only 22 and I already feel like I should be packing her in. Like I've lived long enough, and am exhausted.

___________________________________________________________

I've felt like total garbage emotionally/mentally (and physically) since around May of this year. I think what I'm feeling is a midlife crisis. I felt like my twenties were never going to end and when it hit me that they were about to, I felt a tremendous sense of time running out and started realizing some terrible truths. First, I'm in the exact same place I was when I was 20 in spite of many failed efforts to fix that. I started seeing signs of aging all of a sudden. But what really did me in was finally landing a full-time job and being ecstatic thinking that I could finally afford to live on my own and be independent instead of continuing to live with my lunatic parents. Then it hit me that I wouldn't even be able to afford to share rent with multiple roommates even on a full-time salary and that realization just broke me. I haven't recovered.

When I would fall into a depression before, I knew it would pass and I just waited it out. However, all these age-related things hitting me at once and feeling like I'm so far behind my peers and feeling like a colossal failure, it's the first time in my life that I've ever felt like I wouldn't be okay. For a while, my life was okay with moments of feeling awful. Now, feeling awful is the norm with fleeting moments of being okay.

Sometimes it's an overnight change. I'll be depressed for a week - crying every single day, that crushing feeling you get in your chest when you feel your worst, wanting nothing more than to die, researching suicide methods, etc. Then for a day or two, I'll be closer to normal or maybe even a little happy. Then something will set me off (like making a minor mistake, or sometimes nothing at all triggers it) and I fall right back down into that hole and become miserable again. I just feel like life will never get any better and I don't really want to stick around to see how much worse everything is going to get. I was freaking out so badly back in the summer that I gave myself godawful muscle pain in my back and ribs that was mistaken for a pulmonary embolism and I was sent to the ER. A $1500 hospital bill to pay when I make $10 an hour didn't really help me to feel better about my financial position.

Is it normal for depression to do this? To come in waves, but never truly get better? Or do I not even know how to be depressed correctly and I'm just being a crybaby and having a bunch of consecutive adult tantrums? I've lost my desire to do pretty much all my hobbies at this point and when I try to pick them back up, I just find them to be frustrating instead of enjoyable. I just think I'm good and truly done with everything, and knowing I'm too much of a wuss to actually kill myself just compounds those feelings of hopelessness.",5,"making a minor mistake, crushing feeling you get in your chest feelings, of hopelessnes,s fall right back down into that hole,become miserable again, garbage emotionally, mentally ,physically, midlife crisis, so far behind my peers,feeling like a colossal failure,"

Everyone will either spend new years with friends or with a Significant Other or going out or something better than me sitting alone inside my apartment isolated like it's just any other miserable  day.   I guess I'm reaping what I've sown from years of isolation and being numb from my bad habits/addiction, but still hurts.  Anyone else hate holidays as much as I do???  Also it's funny in a pathetic way I use to get black out drunk so I could feel something anything when I was totally numb, now I can feel again and all I want to do is get black out drunk so I can be numb and get rid of the loneliness and psychological pain, life is a bitch.

"For my entire life, I've been a little off on the inside. I feel like I have felt everything. I had deja vu all the time when I was a bit younger, like I had already seen everything. This grew into anger and hatred for non-original thought. I see it as people thinking that they say original things, but in my mind, it makes me extremely frustrated. 

A little while ago, I started watching anime, primarily moe content. This woke something in me, and it wasn't good. It left me with very high standards and expectations of females, both physically and in terms of personality. Lately I've been seeing all girls around me as unimpressive, and I desire something more.

At this point, I was on the verge of depression. I'm seeing everyone as inferior and not worth spending time with. This is strange for me, because for my whole life I've loved others and felt extreme empathy and compassion for everyone.

So here I am, with high standards, irritable, possibly depressed, lonely, confused and wrathful. Now, another unreasonable standard in finding a female my age (16) approaches. I have developed a desire to be obsessed over. To the point where she'd hurt herself for me. I'd feel immensely sorry afterwards, but I'd still make her do it again. (Sick I know...) I don't know if I want the feeling of being the hero or what, but this has become somewhat of a must for me...

I've read a lot of 'help', nobody feels the way I do. I might consider myself in a somewhat critical state of emotion right now, as I feel too sad to leave the house, or even my room. Please help me...

"All types of depression fucking suck. Mine feels like a daily battle and a war of attrition. But what I really want in life is to love someone again or to make people laugh.  Will you go look in your mirror (or use the camera on your phone) and just make a silly face or a smile, please? For one depressed person to another? (Don't take a picture or anything).

"Sometimes i get these waves of immense sadness. I remember having them as a kid. It doesn't occur that often now as it did then. I noticed that it happens when i'm dressing up or know i'm going out somewhere. for some reason, that seems to be the trigger most of the time, sometimes it's not. 

When i was a kid, i didn't think of it much. It's like 'this happens and i'm sad for some reason'' and it lasted briefly. 5 min max. I googled these waves and experiences were pretty similiar to mine from what i've read. But people there seemed to be on some medication and i never was.

I was as young as six, when i remembered the feelings of these waves. It felt like pure sadness and dread. It would get me so out of nowhere too. My heart would suddenly feel too heavy and it seemed like it would slide down from all that weight it was suddenly carrying.

I kinda felt like i wasn't in my body either. Nothing too extreme but detached kinda. Like i was talking normally and moving normally too, but it felt like something was doing that for me and i was so small in my body, somewhere in the background, watching.

Spending it alone. I know there are parties around where I would be welcome, but I'm tired. I can't deal with wearing a happy mask today. So much bad stuff has been dropped on me in the past week or two that I just can't.

And here comes the New Year. I know it's just another day. An arbitrary start and stop point. But I still cant help but think about how it's a bad omen and since I'm starting it bad it's just going to be a bad year. Optimists might say ""hey, it can only get better from here.""

"Like I often think that depression isn't a disability and I'm always in amazement when I am actually aloud to take time off of work from it. But I think that way because depression is only in your mind(?).

I see people with beautiful appearances not looking happier than anyone else. What I see is (MOST of) them visibly, sadistically enjoying their genetic superiority, walking around like they're broadcasting how they are better than everyone. It's repulsive. Sometimes, I even see entire families of beautiful people, collectively showing body language in this way. That's even worse.

"I feel humbled each time I go in this sub as it comforts me knowing there's more people with fucked up minds too.

Don't know if there's a specific section for this but I just need some advice from others who may relate to my thoughts (this is kinda like a penny for your thoughts situation)

I'm done. Tired of feeling paralyzed in my mind. Tried to cry due to the overwhelming feelings of shame, self loathing, anger and pure fucking unexplainable misery but again I'm not even allowed the privilege to alleviate and try to find resolution.

Not even going to try and kill myself as it is fleeting, each a failure and my life being the biggest. Been to all the therapists and doctors who all gave up on me as my mind is broken beyond repair and all I get now is the ""is does get better"" bullshit when it does absolutely nothing for me. I'm just so tired of everything now and im getting frequent waves of pure hatred for people in general which makes me just want to be someplace alone. I hate being around people as they all seem to shit rainbows and unicorns which highlights just how fucking miserable and alien I am. I feel so defeated like why do I have to put every ounce of effort to fake a smile and turn up to obligations such as work as society wants ""happy and self motivated individuals"" which is all a load of shit. I also cant comprehend how and why people are so naturally happy. Like it's almost New Year's Day and I can hear again such loud reminders of how the vast majority of people are normal and happy beyond belief reigning in on the new year when I'm sat alone in my room, had a breakdown wanted to kill myself again with new inventive methods as my previous ones have eluded me like my sanity and contentment towards life.

Again, why can't I just feel basic emotions? Why am I forced as this hollow, pathetic husk of a person and my mind being a shattered vessel lost miles down in a fucking  sea  somewhere when all ""normies"" around me are full of shits and giggles being so blissfully ignorant drinking and getting piss lit. Why can't I smile as I feel positive emotions or laugh at something funny  or even feel scared I could be chased by a crackhead or a clown or something. Nowadays there's nothing. I don't smile. I don't eat or sleep properly. NOTHING is worth doing all hobbies and shit I liked are a chore or a pass time now I'm just counting down the days and even this year has been this shittest and yet I'm still coming into terms how my attempts have left me alive and why I'm continuing. Why bother living if I'm not happy or content and I'm living in auto pilot. I dissassociate my way through life and I'm hitting 20 in 2 months.

I just need something to help at this point. Restarting my 700th therapy session/s on Friday so hopefully she can sprinkle some fairy dust in my water or some shit cus as far as things go I'm losing the slither of faith I have left. 

Thank you for listening. It's 1hr 30mins till New Year's and I hope I fall asleep as I'm not listening to all the fireworks and all this bullshit. Nothing to celebrate for me .

"This past year has been amazing in terms of working on my mental illness. The past month or so (Holidays are the worst for me since I don't talk to my family.) I've been really going up and down. I have bipolar disorder, PTSD and anxiety in addition to my depression. The other voice in my head is back. It keeps telling me horrible things.. I logically understand that this is just a downtime for me and that it'll pass eventually, even if it takes weeks; but I feel like I'm so tired. I'm tired of fighting with myself. I hate this world we live in, my two best friends are only great for shallow socializing. They don't understand my diseases and I just isolate myself for weeks at a time because I have no one to turn too. My roommate is fantastic, he's always been there for me but I can see how much it wears him down. I'm tired of being a burden. 

I've always pushed people away and I really just want to disappear. I don't want to exist anymore. I'm just so so so so so exhausted of fighting my illnesses. I'm tired of constantly fighting an uphill battle. I think it might be time for me to leave this world, if not now then soon.

I think what really, really makes me angry is that I know I'm acting irrationally, it's like the real me is forever trapped inside a glass, sound-proof box screaming that it'll be okay and watching myself lash out in anger. I'm watching myself isolate myself from the people I care about and I can't do anything about it. It's like watching my own demise, like watching myself drive off a cliff.

Birthdays are bad because no one cares enough to remember. Not as lonely necessarily, but disappointing. You are a certain age, you should have certain experiences and skill, but you donât. You should have accomplished something in an entire year, right? No, you are a worthless and pathetic waste of energy. Someone should really kill me, because all I am is a waste.

I was invited to a few parties, but itâs wishful thinking to imagine myself having gone to any of them. So here I am, in this shithole apartment, with my mother sleeping in the bed next to mine so I canât even get up to have a smoke without waking her. Iâm only 17, I should be out having fun, meeting people, experiencing my youth, but my depression and anxiety are so bad I could hardly muster up the courage to even set foot outside. I canât believe this is how I ended up. I know I know, Iâm still young, I havenât quite âended upâ anywhere yet, but Iâve more or less made up my mind that suicide is the end goal. And with how bad my depression is getting, itâs gonna happen sooner rather than later. Anyway, Happy New Year.

"i see all the people celebrating, all the big lights, the fireworks, the ornaments, but none of it moves me even just a little. what is new years but just another excuse for all the sheep to get belligerent, numbing themselves from the bigger picture? ""tradition""? fuck that, there's no such thing behind it. christmas and new years are a masterclass in capitalism at work. valentines, easter, halloween, etc. are all crash courses in capitalism, but new years/christmas are the phd. it makes me sick. all these sheep spending all their hard earned loot on things they think they can't live without, which really won't yield anything of substance, only one fleeting moment of feigned happiness. is it worth it? are you so miserable that retail therapy is what you turn to to feel better for one moment? all this shit is a topical anaesthetic, never getting at the meat of it. society is so doomed. 

culture doesn't exist anymore. we're afraid of our history. on this relentless pursuit of creating a unified world we're negating our rich cultural heritages, which can be curated to leave out the negatives.

is sex really the *only* thing that matters in life? it seems it's everyones prime motive. make money. why? so you can attract cheap people who'll fuck you once they know you've got it? money is just another topical anaesthetic. might as well be monopoly money, because none of what it gets you has any real substance. the only reason you want it is so you can quench your insatiable thirst for fucking. anyone who claims sex isn't the core of it all just never got enough of it so lies to themselves, taking a fake moral high ground- fuck you. we're living in an era where plethoras of shit relationships abound. relationships formed not organically, but by way of swiping right on an app on our phones for fucks sake. absolutely repulsive, breading legions of hedonists who later in life will have to hide their pasts from their partners. ""wholesome""? what the fuck is that... a relic of a long defunct past. there's more to relationships than sex-appeal- it's those little idiosyncrasies which make you want someone in the long run; those little quirky things which make them uniquely them, which you'll never get to know just by swiping right. and even for those who don't dabble in this e-fornication, they're doing it all wrong for the most part. a great lasting relationship will only become harder and harder to find moving forward. and even those that exist, a lot of them are founded under false pretences. people are seldom honest, thinking their lies will get them ahead, but they only land you deeper in a hole. be honest with yourselves and with others. 

society today is pathetic. every single person, young or old, glued to their damn 'smart' devices which serve no purpose other than to dumb you down- perfect irony. i'm 28, but am living among hoards of technosheep instead of real humans who thrive off personal contact. it's sickening. everyone living their lives for your viewing pleasure, presenting you perfectly curated renditions of their ideal, which they'll never really have. everything is so shallow, never venturing to go beyond the surface. there might be factions of people who don't adhere to this new way of life, but fuck it, so what? it's only getting worse. 

buy, buy, buy, drink, drink, drink, fuck, fuck, fuck.

"Well, I am new to the Reddit app. I have been learning and researching about depression,anxiety, and many other mental disorders. But what I have came across is summarizing,paraphrasing,emotional intelligence, and emotional balance. Please consider reading this post. I have done a good amount of research. If someone has done research(science included) and want to share his/her opinion, they are scientifically correct because if you have science to defend your theory/opinion/idea/thesis/conclusions you are correct.

To start off,summarizing and paraphrasing is the most important thing when researching/investigating because that way you'll learn anything with 100% perfect clarity. In order to paraphrase and summarize you simply have to put what you have read and seen in your words. Summarizing and paraphrasing is scientifically proven the best way to learn anything.

Emotional Intelligence(EQ) or (EI) is the ability to take control of your emotions and also being able of controlling others emotionally such as intimidating someone, scaring someone,dominating someone, and so on. Emotional Intelligence is the skill of taking control of your emotions and by taking control of your emotions you will not let fear,panic,depression,anxiety,anger,shyness,nervousness control your mind. Always maintain your mind under control. EQ is much more important than IQ(intelligence).

There are many articles on the internet claiming they can cure social anxiety, and other mental disorders, but in reality is much more complex than simply saying things like; Be more open to people, be confident, talk to girls. All of these tips/advises are nothing but helpless information for people with different mental disorders(same as mental illness).

Emotional Balance means to control and keep your emotions balanced, don't let sadness, and other feelings/emotions take control of your mind and body completely.

I'm still making awful mistakes..like I haven't learned anything. 

but I just, I can't accept everything that has happened without crumbling completely. 

I am still doing exactly the same things over and over again because I'm an idiot. because I can't just decide to do different. because I'm weak and broken. 

nature can be cruel. why should it be any different? Why should I expect any different? if I want to ignore the rules of society, then am I no better than an animal? should I be treated like on?

I'm just miserable and there is a sickening certainty I have about things only getting worse. 

I'm crying out to people who can't help me. I feel like I'm screaming into a void. I feel helpless and broken and weak and ignored and worthless. 

why did my life have to turn into this. I made mistakes yes. but like this? this is what I deserve? wishing to die in my sleep because I find no joy in life, no passion, nothing to pursue or take interest in. I haven't committed suicide over these last 6 years, fighting the urge on a weekly basis at the least, because my family doesn't deserve to experience that pain. 

was I such a terrible person to deserve this? or do I continue to see all these little choices as things that don't matter, when they are exactly what should be of most importance. 

I'm just going to rot away. I'm sorry I can't do better. I signed up big time and I can't recover from it. I'm always going to be stuck with this deep regret that I should have done differently. that I should have been smarter or more careful. 

but no. I just, took a huge risk, and lost just about everything. I don't recognize myself anymore. I don't feel like myself. I feel like being hurt so much has fundamentally changed me, and I feel like I just don't have the ability to wait it out through small steps and hard work. 

I always worked hard. always. now I'm tired. I worked so hard just to throw it all away. I worked so hard to build the beginning of a good life just to get distracted by something shinier, and now nothing is as shiny as that thing, not even that thing itself. it's gone.. I have nothing left to look forward to. I'm broken and I'm miserable and I just wish the torture would end, one way or another. I can't take it anymore. I can't take these feelings, these regrets. I can't keep making excuses and trying to convince myself into something to make it seem less awful feeling. I can't even begin to convey the amount of pain this loss has caused. I can't stop feeling like I'm going to lose more unless I accept what I've already lost, be an adult and stop whining over things that can't be changed. 

I just, I've never let this stuff out. I've never taken down the delusion and stared my grief in the face. and sometimes I'm so numb from the pain that I don't even know what I'm missing. because it felt that way then, and it still feels the same. something important is missing from my life.

"I find myself frequenting this sub a lot, usual late at night listening to some music. The problem is personally I  do not suffer from any sort of depression. In fact I'm glad that I consider my life is pretty decent, albeit with a few shortcomings.

I've come to say that you all can do it, everyone of you can achieve and be something greater. It may seem like it's impossible for some, but life is a hard, hard road. You don't have to be depressed to know life is quite the bitch and throws you around all the time. But having the strength to keep going and fighting for yourself is what keeps us all here. The fact all of you are here is a miracle in itself, and while many people  may see it as more of a curse than a blessing, just know that life has strange ways of working, and everyone here has the ability to live up to what they want to be

Itâs illuminating and glowing, and I can see others basking it itâs glow, prompting me to come join them. Then they start trying to yell encouragement at me like âyou can do it!â âCome get your happiness,â âyouâre not trying hard enough!â âTry harder,â but it doesnât matter how much I struggle against my shackles I canât reach it, I canât get to it.

"Hi, 23 M have been living with depression for at least 8 years, maybe longer i've kinda forgotten when it started its been so long. Been at the tipping point for a while now, although for some reason my death would upset some people so i refuse to do it as much as i want to. Problem is, living in this state is really hard as i feel as though im forced to live.

The advice im after is, what does going to counselling actually do? Because i've sat for numerous hours thinking about it, but can't see any way it would help? Like i don't actually like this world and even if my attitude changed my situation wouldn't, and if anything relying on pure hope to get me through another 50~ years of despair would just be more painful than accepting it?

"TLDR One can often feel fine mentally, but be unable to present this to the world, because the body manifests depression so thoroughly on a physical level. The face and body present depression, to the point where its literaly impossible to smile or convey any genuine impression of yourself, even though you should otherwise be mentally fine.  


...


Example, I wake up in the morning, my mood is more or less fine and i feel ready to go to work and go about my day. I get out of bed and i feel a little stiff and achy, maybe dehydrated. 

Go to the bathroom and in the mirror Im like ""Oh no, what the fuck is that!?"" I look unbelievably sad and unhealthy, my eyes are hollow and look sad and weak, I dont recognise myself in this face at all. I summon up the emotions that made me quite confident yesterday, but they barely register on the face. Its impossible to smile, it looks like a grimace. 

I soend half an hour in front of the mirror trying to force myself to look normal and composed, but every time i turn back and catch myself again i see this shell emanating horrible vibes. 

Again, i didnt wake up feeling this way, I wasnt even aware of it until i became aware of myself physically by 1) moving around and 2) observing myself. 

You end up almost late for work because you cant convince yourself to leave the house. It might even be easier if you were mentally down, at least that would fit with your physical self image now. 

People at work say, ""Ive not seen you so depressed, whats got you down"", or ""I think i know what youre sad about"". But for all that, it is nothing in particular you're down *about* - it is a physical thing. 

You just want your face to cheer up and your shoulders to relax so you can be yourself, but its physically impossible. There are no tricks or thoughts that will lift you out of it. The subtlest or most powerful *thought* doesnt matter because your body is not physically expressing what is happening inside. 

We always talk about depression as a *mental* illness but in my experience its the physical factors that predominate, and to such an extent that the ability to deal with it mentally *almost doesnt matter*. You can have your thoughts in order but what your body is presenting to the world physically is an impossible barrier to overcome.

~Dushka Zapata

.............................................................................................

How can you begin to live my life in a more pragmatic way?

Basically deal with things in a sensible and realistic manner.**Be organised.** It is a simple thing to do and will have the most effective results in every aspect of your life, be it at home, in highschool,college, in your place of work.  A tidy life, will lead to a tidy mind which in turn will lead to you making better decisions when you need to be sharp, alert and on the 'button' when it comes to problem solving and taking action.

**A confession:**

You cry and suffer alone. Nobody is there to help you. There is this form of helplessness that goes from you crying nearly every day, till you realize that nobody is there to hear you. Crying then becomes pointless.

Crying is a distress signal, if the signal isnât answered, itâs useless. So what happens? Well, your brain tries to find other ways to deal with suffering. As a result of nobody answering your distress calls, your brain learns over time that every single problem that youâll EVER suffer from for the rest of your life, you must solve alone. Period.

The world has given us the middle finger and said âGoodluck dumbass, youâre on your own!â You learn that because nobody was there for you, you become 99.99% reliant on YOURSELF. You are now the only person you can trust. Everyone else means nothing to you. Why care about someone if:

1. They werenât ever there for you, and

2. Youâve already learned how to be reliant on yourself, you donât need people anymore.

You develop this zenn state where you feel as if youâre in a bit of an odd trance, like nothing really matters as much as you think it does and you stop putting emotions into just about anything.

As a result of your abuse, your problems stop feeling like problems. I hypothesize that the reason behind this is because when you were having problems, nobody was there to help you. There was no empathy for you and you were always left solving problems yourself.Eventually you just learn to cope with it by looking for solutions instead of self-loathing and whining about it because whenever they showed signs of distress, nobody was there to pick them up.

"I feel like a hypocrite posting here, because I've only now started actually realizing I might have depression and I might've been fighting it for some time without realizing it, but today was a horrible fucking day and it got better just now. 


So. I charged my iPad today. And found this account. I got into my post history, and surprise surprise, I find a thread from last year. I barely even remember making this post. But if you don't want to read it, generally I complained about having no friends and a girlfriend, I felt like I'm doomed to never have friends, I said I ""overcame"" social anxiety which I never did, and I felt like everyone was better than me. I wanted to quit my job back then, after only 2 weeks, because I couldn't handle the anxiety of working with others there (an anxiety I wasn't even aware of, by the way). 


I didn't quit. I kept working there. And you know what? Everything I wished for back then have come true. I made tons of friends at work. Everyone loves me there. To this day I hang around with people I'm only going to meet 8 months after making this post! That's crazy. My confidence has boosted. My self esteem has boosted. And the funniest part? I have a girlfriend. Back when I made that post, I had already met that girlfriend, I just didn't know how things are going to unfold. 


So yeah, everything I wanted was solved. And with the solutions came new problems. Life isn't always fun or good, problems just keep coming our way. I wanted friends? Good luck learning how to handle and keep friendships. I wanted a girlfriend? Oh buddy. You're going to have to tackle your worst insecurities, fears and ugly sides of yourself because you're sharing life with another person now. I wanted more confidence? That just means I'm going to get out of my comfort zone more times, and believe me, the same fear is still here.



What I'm saying is, to all of you sad mothercukers out there, the world sucks. Life sucks. I'm sad right now, the most I've ever been sad. I'm on anti depressant, go to therapy, and shit, there no solution in sight. I can't remember crying as much as I did today, ever. 

But just know. All of you sad brothers and sisters. Know that it gets better. Wether you want it or not. Wether it happens in a month, year, or 10 years. Things change for the better. If the world can turn against you, it can also turn in your favor. You just have to give it the opportunity to do so. Non of us want to get out of bed, to work out, to socialize. I know the pain my dudes. But you gotta keep doing it, because the potential for things to get better is there if you only give the world the opportunity to do so. So give yourself the opportunity to feel better. Please. It's a new year. You don't have to be happy, you don't have to feel good. Both of those are the world's job. Your job is to stay hopeful. So stay hopeful, and let life do its thing. It will definitely give back one day. I feel like fucking shit today , but  the moment I press ""submit"" I'm going to brush my teeth, drink a cup of water, and meditate for 5 minutes. Because I don't have to feel good to tell depression ""fuck you!"" in the face. So fuck you depression! ",5,like everyone was better than me

"Spent all day on the phone with my family crying. Iâm not sure I have the strength to carry on anymore. Iâve had to be âstrongâ for such a long time and I canât do it anymore.

Iâve been thinking about dying for a really long time. Multiple times a day, and after a lot of research Iâve sort of unofficially settled on hanging in the absence of a better method. 

I realized I didnât have anywhere to suspend from so thatâs been a deterrent for most of this (or I should say last) year.

But today I realized my door is high enough and sturdy enough to hang myself from and Iâve been crying all day and feeling at rock bottom so I decided to test a possible hanging rig. 

I got my scarf around my neck and tightened it to the point that my face felt swollen and I couldnât breathe. Kept it for a few seconds until my heart started to pound suddenly so I undid it.

It wasnât as unpleasant as I thought it would be. It wasnât great but it was surprisingly not as unpleasant as I had always anticipated.

This doesnât give me hope in a weird way because youâd think feeling so desperate and so hopeless for so long, the potential of ending this suffering might bring relief but I think itâs more that Iâve lost all ability to feel any kind of hope.",5,"Spent all day on the phone with my family crying , thinking about dying, to hang myself,  couldnât breathe,so desperate,"

So I would drag that person down with me, if he/she loved me too. So I don't know if two-sided love would be the best case or worst case.

I think I'm just a burden, because most of the time I am useless and super demotivated (except for some manic phases which are &lt;2 hours long).
So I can probably never get rid of all these negative feelings. I tried, it didn't work 2/2 times. 

So what can I do except for killing myself?
I am sick, everything I think is probably wrong or distorted, and this stuff will keep coming back, will never go away. I am just a waste of time, money and nerves. Much of all of that.

And I don't even feel much about it. The only feeling I have are sadness, some relieve when it's gone for the short manic phases (after which I am crushed down by falling again) and hurt, so much hurt.

I became serious with out any sign of change and now I don't care about anything, but mean absolutely anything it is what can only be described as ""detached"". It could have been from suppression of who I am since that age because of people having expectations for me resulting in me not developing any real hobbies/interests  and knowing how to express my likes/dislikes or due to some other events that led me to suppress myself.

"I used to try to talk to people about my depression, and tell them how I felt. In the end it only pushed people alway. No one wants to hear about your depression and the things you go through that suck.

If you think you've found something different I promise you, you haven't, you're just missing whatever that other person is getting out of you. 
As shitty as this sounds, once you know this, you can rearrange your behavior to reflect how people really feel. Why try and talk about your depression with someone? In the end you're really just bringing them down. It's better to focus on something positive or if you can't just make some space and don't talk about anything at all. The people people love to be around are ""always in a good mood"" or ""always down to have a good time"". Chances are these people have issues as well they probably just handle them better. They know that no one really cares about their problems, and people just want someone they can have fun with so they play them game. And when these people can't play the game anymore they spend sometime alone. Sure, maybe some people are just naturally happier than others but that doesn't mean that even naturally unhappy people can't use the same strategy. They might just have to spend more time by themselves.

"I have never been diagnosed with depression or even talked to a professional about it being a possibility.
But I used to think about it a lot. Especially during the last several years of my previous relationship.
I felt like the worst human being because my SO was actually a wonderful person, but I couldn't bring myself to feel happy. Instead, I felt trapped. I often thought I would eventually have to consider suicide if I wanted to get out of it, but I didn't need to worry because I wasn't at that stage yet. I just cried a lot. I also grew to find self harm theraputic, but knew I wouldn't do anything 'too far'. When I did end that relationship, I did an emotional 180, which let me justify and blame all those feelings on the relationship. And up until now I believed that.

I have been in my current relationship for a little less than a year and I am just starting to feel myself sink. But this time it has nothing to do with my SO. In fact, I'm terrified because I'm so invested in them and I don't want them to see me this way. I'm scared of losing them because all I can do is sit around and be a pathetic mop of a person.
I know how good my life is right now so I don't want to do anything to damage it.
I don't have anyone that I am comfortable opening up to with my emotional stuff.
I don't know if anyone can help me try to get my head in the right place, but I would really appreciate any suggestions on how to take control of my own feelings.

"This has been going on for years, but it wasn't till today that I noticed it was happening. I get this sence of relief when I reach out towards people to hang out, but they tell me they can't.

It happened to me today, I was home alone and craving human contact. I called my friend to see if he wanted to hang out, but he tells me that he couldn't cause he was working. I then get a sense of relief, and I'm happy for all of two seconds cause I get to stay home, but the happiness fades, and I'm back to being depressed cause I can't hang out.

The opposite also happens. When my friend tells me that he can hang out, I get this feeling of dread, and I have to force myself to not cancel my plans. After we hang out, I ended up exhausted and tired, but a little bit less depressed.

Am I the only one that is a mess of contradictions?",5,"craving human contact, up exhausted"

"I have nobody in my life right now, and life seems meaningless because of it. I think that committing suicide is a good idea, but I want to give it a few years first until I really really can't take it anymore before I go there.

I've seen a lot of horrible stuff in my life, and I don't doubt that I will become a sociopath or criminal because of it down the road. So maybe it is better that I kill myself sooner rather than later.

I was raised by my mom and her brother, who was into a lot of trouble with both the law and other criminals. I witnessed him being assaulted four times as a little kid, and he would have shouting matches on the phone with people every night. My mom finally kicked him out when I was 11, and I never saw him again.

My mom died of cancer last July. She'd been fighting lung cancer since before I was born. We had a terrible relationship, but there were still a few good moments that can never come back now.

As fate would have it, my only friend also died of cancer last year. He was only 18.

I live with a friend of my mom's currently. She has a kind heart and gives me food and a place to live, but we barely say a word to one another.

I'm so used to being forgotten, to have promises broken on a whim. If I respect people, I want to get it back, and I usually don't. I'm seen as a cold guy with a mean face, and most people at my school by now think I'm going to go on a rampage and they steer clear of me. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I don't love anyone either. If I saw a stranger dying, I would be more likely to either ignore them or say, ""sucks to be you"" than I would to try to comfort them in their last moments. I know I'm a terrible person for feeling that way, but I know that is the treatment I would also get in that situation. I don't want to be a sociopath or a narcissist, but I feel the world gives me no other choice at times. If I start to care for someone, they pass away or turn against me.",5,"terrible relationship, trouble, law, criminals, assaulted, sociopath, kill myself, meaningless"
"I admire her so much. She makes my life worth living another day. My depression is so gut-wrenching and I often find myself struggling for a will to live, but her smile is so infectious and she makes me smile in even the darkest moments. 

But I need to emotionally detach myself from her. She doesn't even know I exist. She lives thousands of miles away, is super succesful, and has a loved one of her own. 

Does anyone else emotionally attach themselves to people (like entertainers, celebrities, idols, etc.) almost as a form of escapism, but know that you'll never meet them and it hurts? 
I personally am a huge fan of one specific band/group member, and she makes me really happy, I'm just trying to emotionally detach myself from her because I'm afraid her group is going to disband in the near future and she's going to be out of the public eye.

"My mom is largely what keeps me here when I don't want to be. She's an amazing woman who has given me everything she had. But, for whatever fucking reason, I wish she hadn't. I wish she didn't care. I wish I could just die without destroying her, and I often resent her for it when she absolutely does not deserve it. I feel guilty and fucked up.

I want to help people. I want to dedicate my life to a nonprofit that helps people with mental issues that can't afford treatment. If I died I could never achieve that goal and help those people. Yet, I often wish I wouldn't wake up. I just feel guilty and selfish.",5,"Guilty, selfish "
"I feel like recently especially I have turned into a robot. While I cry myself to sleep occasionally, over time I've learned to deal with the pain to the point of numbness.

"I've always felt like emotions are hard for me, I always smile but thats just to make other people feel at ease around me. 


when something bad happens I rarely cry, I do feel aching in my heart and know that its sad I just don't feel like crying is the right way to react.

"I myself am clean from self-harming for almost 3 years. When I used to harm myself, I would do it in places no one could ever see, if it didn't work I used makeup to conceal even the smallest marks.However my friend's story is rather different. 

I saw my friends cuts on his arm, some weeks they are worse, some better.  The marks of cuts and bruises are extremely visible since he often wears T shirts.  Once I shared my battle with depression and self-harming, thinking that maybe he will open a little bit but it didn't happen. All I know from him is that he has troubles controlling his emotions and uses hurting himself as means of gaining control over the negative feelings.

The thing is


1. I don't know how to react (should I ignore the fresh marks as if they weren't there and go on talking whatever?? Or should I bring it up?)

2. Should I suggest him seeing a professional? I always offer my own help but he never asks for it... ",5,"self-harming, never asks for it"
"The world  is covered in snow

Today's holiday I am still alone

This morning, she handed over the city

We've been dying spots on a white stump

When thoughts go far from here

To save the world I have no idea

And everything eventually covered the snow

Someone like me was here

Someone like us, here after us

Who surrendered the city a long time ago

We're always on ice and everything's fine

"Depression itâs a bitch.
Its like there is a constant voice in your head telling you that you are worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, a disappointment that you donât deserve happiness or to be alive but to only feel pain. It makes you feel like you are forever trapped in an abyss with no way of crawling out. Sometimes you can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it always drags you back deeper than youâve gone before and the impossible cycle of escaping begins again. No matter how much you try to escape the darkness, your brain yearns for the dark thoughts to return because it happens so frequently that it becomes the comfort zone for it. 
You begin to doubt everything about yourself; telling yourself whatever you do isnât good enough and you should just stop trying or its worthless to just go on and might be better to just end it all. You feel like you are nothing and will be important to anyone ever and when you are gone everyone will be happier knowing the pathetic failure that they once knew will be gone forever and can no longer fuck up their lives. 
All the smiles on the outside is just a mask to cover how you really feel. You cut because you feel like you deserve the sharp stinging sensation as the blade cuts your arm open and the blood slowing oozing out. Afterwards you are left with scars as a constant reminder of the pain you cause others and how worthless you are. ",5,"worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, disappointment, escaping, pain"

I really donât know where to start but Iâm going to say things are heavy on my chest? Idk I donât feel right, so sorry if this was the wrong place 

I really want help from a doctor or whatever, but I donât know who are they or where, I searched online to see whereâs the best doctors in my country and mostly they werenât in the same city, Iâve gone to a one in my city, itâs supposed to be the best, the appointment cost about 120 dollars maybe *itâs not our official currency I just converted* after waiting literally 7 hours *my appointment supposed to be at 1 pm but Iâve entered 8 pm* the only things she said âitâs not really depression youâre just lonely without friends and without any life activity, and you know about depression and you donât think yours a big dealâ will she said more than that but thatâs the summary of it, Iâve been with her for about 40 minuetsâ¦ I really didnât feel comfortable with her because how busy she isâ¦ she said come to me next week but I didnât go, thatâs all was before 3 weeks or soâ¦ I really donât know what to do and I want someone who I can talk to him, but how? Iâve never experienced anything like thisâ¦
Originally I didnât expect really to go to a therapistâ¦ one of my online friends was really trying to push me to a therapist, but the problem he doesnât live in my country so he doesnât know anyoneâ¦

One of the things that bothered me when the therapist said âyou need friendsâ I already have friends, maybe dozens of themâ¦ online friends, real life friends, and online friends who Iâve met themâ¦ still I feel lonely and lost between themâ¦ Iâm not really the best person between themâ¦ I may be even the worstâ¦ I hate being aliveâ¦

Iâm still 18 people say you havenât experienced life happy things will comeâ¦ but thereâs nothing such as happinessâ¦ finals are next Tuesday and I havenât studied anything yetâ¦ Iâm scared of my parents and donât want to talk with them because I hate themâ¦ I guess having a D isnât badâ¦ I donât want really to liveâ¦ self harm my self every 4 days or so, mostly my legs because I canât let my parents see itâ¦ ugliest person in earthâ¦ tried to suicide two times but I was so scared so bad thing to be aliveâ¦I always cry in the shower because thatâs the only place I can cry without anyone askingâ¦ I have a bad relationship with my brother and sister, none of them like meâ¦ lately I lose my temper so fast, and it annoy meâ¦ not to mention how I hate my body, I used to go the gym daily and lost a lot of wight but Iâve become worse nowâ¦ I donât know about my self Iâm scared of people or talking to new people or even sometimes my friendsâ¦

I used to play video games, having a YouTube channel that was growing really good, I donât feel itâs like accomplishing anything thing itâs just a crap and I feel depressed so I left it nowâ¦ itâs useless to try anything to be honest 

I really hate wasting my time by watching movies or netflix or animeâ¦ and mostly pornâ¦ idk I donât know even my self 

Oh also one more thing in high school I used to get high grades but my parents literally was angry at me for not getting âfull gradesâ idkâ¦

"It's 4:18 AM as I'm typing this, and I can't sleep. It always takes me a long time to fall asleep, but I couldn't stop thinking and stressing about going back to work after the holidays. Before I knew it, I was about to break down and hyperventilate or cry. I didn't want to wake up my fiancÃ©e, so I got up and I'm now sitting in the livingroom. I'm sorry for whining when I know other people have it much worse than I do, but I need to vent.

I'm almost 30 years old, the son of the owner of a local business in a small town located in QuÃ©bec, Canada. I work for his company, which deals in the sales and repair of commercial and industrial equipment. On paper, I work in sales; in reality, I do practicality everything except for repairs, including but not limited to sales, purchasing, quotations, invoicing, customer service at the counter, on the phone and online, retail item placement and management, parts and equipment research, shipping and receiving, data entry and processing, IT, webmaster, infographics and promotional materials. I also manage our team to some degree and replace the boss and our accounts receivables/payables (his girlfriend) whenever they're away, so I handle late payment complaints even though I can't do anything about it. I'm bilingual and so almost all communications in English are done through me.

That may sound like a fair bit, but I then I also do approximately 75% of one of my colleagues' work because he quite simply can't be arsed to do it. He'll act like he's super busy doing one task whereas I'm typically juggling (no joke) between 5 and 8 tasks at any time, yet I often find him playing solitaire or stretching and loudly yawning at his desk, even when customers are waiting at the counter. A couple summers ago, for two years in a row, when we were the only employees in front, he literally spent hours sleeping at his desk while I alone held the fort throughout our busy seasons. He's approaching retirement age and has been involved with the family for decades; he's not going anywhere.

The foreman in charge of managing repairs and our crew of mechanics routinely vanishes, either going out for errands that take a suspicious amount of time to run, going upstairs to do work for his own company on our dime, spending half an hour in the washroom (upstairs for some reason), running home for one reason or another, or just plain nowhere to be found for no known reason. He fails to properly submit quotations to most customers and fails to properly fill out repair files, so we have to inform customers and make out invoices at the counter when they come in. He also gets me to find parts and pricing as well as place orders for him because he seemingly doesn't feel like doing that himself, maybe because that would cut into his Facebook time. He's typically 15-30 minutes late each morning and afternoon, but he takes off at closing time on the dot, if not a few minutes early. I think it's fair to say that I effectively do about half of his job for him. He's family and is seemingly unfireable for some reason, despite the fact that he's hurting the company badly.

I'll admit I'm usually about 5 minutes late in the morning; I barely get any sleep and never feel rested from any sleep I do get, so it takes a lot of time and motivation to get up and going. That doesn't make it right and I'm ashamed of this bad habit, but I work an extra hour or two everyday, unpaid. I get paid 40 hours a week, but typically work about 50 hours a week. I get reprimanded for being late and for being sick, but unpaid hours go unmentioned. I don't have any fancy diplomas, but I don't think I'd be exaggerating if I said I was a hard worker, maybe even a workaholic.

My father's family is pretty well known locally and is fairly affluent, so customers tend to assume that I'm well off, but they couldn't be further from the truth. I get paid a few dollars more than minimum wage and that's it; no benefits, no commission, no overtime pay, no extra vacation days and no share of the company's profits. I make just enough for my fiancÃ©e and I to survive and afford necessities, and that's about it. Last winter, I couldn't even afford heating, so I had to borrow money to buy fuel oil. Meanwhile, two of my cousins had their houses custom built, one of them spends half his time on vacation with his family and the other's heading to Las Vegas soon, and my other cousin doesn't work but has all her expenditures and house paid for by her dad.

If I dare to complain about my financial difficulties, I get talked down to by my father and his girlfriend and told that I should save up (what is this concept of having leftover money at the end of the month???). They say that my fiancÃ©e should find work, but they don't pay her for the work she does for them. She's a self-employed web designer, artist and programmer; unfortunately, times are tough in that line of business here. She has however done thousands of dollars worth of unpaid work for them, including 3-4 professional websites, and continues to assist them. Any amount she makes goes straight to paying off our debts (credit card) or contributes to paying our expenditures.

My father wants me to buy the business from him so that he has a retirement fund that allows him to keep up his current lifestyle, which includes going on vacation abroad 4-5 times a year, not including camping trips in his RV. However, he refuses to do anything about the obvious issues currently going on and refuses to adapt to the changing market. Suggestions always get turned down and he resists any improvements that I and my only helpful colleague attempt to make. I also routinely have to put up with my father's infantile tantrums and the fact that he doesn't trust me to do anything, resorting to ""micromanaging"". Recently, he doubted my ability to read a PDF in front of a supplier, which was embarassing, and couldn't let me compare invoices (that he asked me to compare) and tried to take over my computer while I was using it so he'd show me how to do my job. It's an extremely stressful work environment, but it's also the way my father has always been with me, and I'm fairly sure that's played a large part in the fact that I have no self-confidence and can't connect with people.

The end result of all the above is that I come home late everyday, exhausted both physically and especially mentally. I barely get any real sleep, my stomach frequently gives me trouble and I suspect that's due to stress, and every little thing feels like a huge challenge. I'm under massive stress because I know very well that if any emergency occurs, if anything breaks or worse, I'm completely unable to afford to solve the issue. Instead, I have to rely on the pity of others, typically my father's if he feels like it (with a healthy dose of acting like he's being generous instead of paying me according to my work), and live with the shame of it. I've always had an exceptional patience with people, but lately the stress has been building up and I've begun snapping at people, worst of all my loving and supportive fiancÃ©e without whom I wouldn't even be around right now.

I've been depressive for over 15 years now and coping with it, but I think this is my lowest point yet. The last week before the holidays, I stood alone in the shipping area and slowly dug a box cutter knife into my left wrist. I was, quite literally, an inch away from ending my life, but it barely left a mark and looks like a skin fold now. I don't want to leave my fiancÃ©e and our cats though, and I especially don't want them to end up in financial trouble. I have a life insurance, but the payout is minimal and they wouldn't cover suicide before at least another year and a half.

I'm going back to work on Monday, less than a week from now. At this point, I only see a few ways out...

- Winning the lottery: Essentially a miracle, but also our only hope of fulfilling any dreams or projects.

- Leaving: Taking a massive risk and leaving my current job, hopefully to work from home online, possibly burning bridges with a family that I do care for despite it all, but also possibly losing everything.

- Staying: Try to last another year and a half in this situation and then examine my options, possibly a rope.

"Just to give some background, I've felt pretty depressed for most of my adult/adolescent life (I'm 21 now) but have never felt able to talk to anyone about it (not even family or close friends).  I have days where I'm in a slightly more positive mood, but generally I just feel pretty apathetic about everything, lethargic and extremely self-critical to the point where it stops me doing things.  I don't really have physical symptoms but being this low obviously causes me to neglect my health quite a bit.  My environment and lifestyle certainly have an impact; I recently moved in with my aunt who has very little understanding of depression (and just emotions generally), and I'm living in a place where I don't really know anyone.

Anyway I took an NHS depression self-assessment recently and the results suggested that I should go and see my GP.  However, I'm seriously doubting whether to do it, I feel like I'd just be a waste of their time.  Besides I know that there's a chance that they might suggest taking anti-depressants, and I'm a little reluctant about that given everything that I've heard and read about them and their side effects.

My mind is drifiting away in a shore of thoughts,
Everything sprayed on a piece of paper in form of a thousand dots,

What should I do with my life?
Get rich, some childrens and a beautiful wife?

But the question is how did I deserve that?
Living in the sewers like an ugly rat,

Waiting for a predator to end me,
'Cause even on the brightest days darkness is all I see,

This darkness feels like a home somehow,
I try to get to it but not now,

Sometimes I am standing on the edge,
Looking back to my life as if it was a sketch,

Maybe I should just erase it,
Throw it in a glowing firepit,

I know I will end forgotten,
Noboy standing next to my coffin,

Buried alongside other forgotten names,
As forgotten as mine,

I mean, with this generation it's like 50% are angsty teens, upset over simple things who glorify this shit then there's another 50% who seriously suffer. Who are mentally ill. It bothers me that this sub even exists, knowing there are so many people who need help, turning to an inappropriate source. I understand a support group, but I've yet to see anything empowering here. Just shit that'll make even the sanest, happiest person kill their fucking self. 

I suggest opening completely up to someone with a degree and credentials to aid you, not a bunch of kids on the internet. There could be something seriously screwed in your psyche and you may need medication or another form of treatment. There are also infections/diseases (and types of cancer, even) that can cause severe depression and addictions in people. Most don't find out 'til too late, when it spreads or whatever.

Itâs 12 am.

I start worrying about when my heart will give out. What happens after we die? Is there a better life ahead? How does it feel to have the life sucked out of you? 

The realization of my dead childhood dog of 15 years hits me. My heart starts to hurt. I regret not being next to her as she was put down. She must hate me. She must have been in so much pain. Alone. Scared. I should have been there. Iâm such a coward.

Firstly, I rear-ended someone hard enough to total my mother's car (it was still completely drivable but FUCK ME, right Geico? :); this happened the 19th.

Then, I got a rental. And took my girlfriend of two years out to dinner on NYE, because that's our anniversary date. Silly me. Someone t-boned my rental car at 55-60 mph and completely destroyed both cars. Thank the fucking lord no one involved sustained any serious injuries, but me and my girlfriend are in pain and quite frankly, while I'm glad she's alive and ultimately okay, I wish I was dead.

I'm on the hook for some serious fucking cash right now. I don't want to do this but I know I have to.

"Iâm in a dark, deep pit in the ground. Itâs deep enough so I can just barely here the outside world up above me, but not much. Thereâs a ladder too. Sometimes, I climb up the ladder to peek out of the pit and see whatâs going on outside. But usually when I do, it starts pouring rain, or a storm starts heading for me. I feel it in my stomach. A lurching, swaying pendulum that swings back and forth. It swings, and I fall down the ladder. I remember that I havenât earned the outside world. I remember that the people out there hate me and rightly should. I remember how selfish it was of me to climb the ladder in the first place as if the world out there wanted anything to do with me.

sometimes it swings a different way, and I feel angry. Angry at myself for not just leaving the pit altogether and facing the world bravely. Angry at the people who hurts me. The pendulum has so much momentum, it slams into my stomach, sending me tumbling off the ladder again, and I hit the freezing cold dirt at the bottom. But I shouldâve known better, no one up there cares about me unless theyâre somehow benefiting from my being around. When I run out of shoulders to be cried on, spare bedrooms for people to stay in, home-cooked food or money, Iâm dispensable. No, less than dispensable- a nuisance. A fly in someoneâs car, or gum on someoneâs shoe. I want to scream but the outside world canât hear me, just as I can barely hear them.

Sometimes, people come by the pit and drop in food as if I were a zoo animal. But I like the food. It helps, and when my stomach is full the pendulum has no room to swing. I feel brave again, climb the ladder up out of the pit, and sometimes I even camp outside the pit with a fire and tent, and sometimes people have fun being with me, I think.

The food comes in little orange bottles with strange names but it still helps. It makes it easier to breathe if I do fall into the pit again.

I don't think about it all the time, but when I do, the idea of no existence feels very tempting. When I wake up, I always ended up sleeping again or just staying more in bed. Even if I get out of bed and have an ok day and all, I still hesitate to do so, because hiding from the world in my bed feels like the best choice as a first thought, when I have just waken up.

(No real solution for this one. Besides, you know, ending things myself before I become trapped in my body.)

2.) Shitty in-laws. It's VERY bad. Spent almost a decade patiently convincing my SO that they hate him. Because they do.

3.) Poverty level.

(Randomly succeed at life and afford to live WOW SO EASY AMIRITE. My solution is to keep leaving below my means. Start gambling safely and see what extra money I can come up with.)

4.) No dependable friends. I talk to people easily. Most suck. Most enjoy suffering and pity points. I want people around me where we all want to SOLVE our depression/etc.

(Keep trying to establish long-term friendship with people. It's basically endless, time-consuming shopping that we all have to do.)

"I don't know if I'm depressed or not, but I do know that ever since October 12th my emotional state has progressively gotten worse. I don't know how much detail we are meant to go into, but that day was I suppose, borderline traumatic... I still remember it vividly. Crying on and off afterwards. 

Since then, I've had okay days where I was relatively happy. There's days when I don't cry, and others where I cry a few times... 

I don't have that much self confidence... I draw and I'm supposively smart, considering my 4. 0 GPA, but... I guess I just compare myself to people. 
I'm not smart, my brother is way smarter. 
I'm not a good artist, just an amateur trying their best. 
I'm not pretty, I have pimples and I don't smile enough. 
I have thoughts like that... People are their own worst critic, right?... but, I don't know if that's necessarily true. I'm overly sensitive, I've noticed. If anyone yells at me or nitpicks my flaws, I'll go off and cry, or at least feel like crying. An insult isn't enough to hurt me much, it's when its personal, Especially when it's my close family and friends saying it.... 

I've almost lost my best friend twice over arguments we had. She's clinically depressed. I can't help her. But I keep trying. During the first argument, I experienced my first and hopefully last panic attack. I've had more common anxious feelings sense. Both times I sobbed for many, many minutes. The pain and worry was unbearable. I didn't want to lose her because of something I did, especially. 

I often blame myself for the things that go wrong. I apologize a lot. I'm too irritable. I'm always tired. It seems like my memory has gotten worse. I'm jumpy, for some reason, especially with loud noises. My drawing hobby, talking with friends, and the internet are mostly the only things that make me happy. But it never lasts. I just wish it would... 

I am a Christian and so are my parents. I try and bring up my feelings with my mother but she insists that it's hormones and I should pray more. I thought she'd understand because of what her life had been like. I thought she'd understand since she's experienced anxiety and depression first hand. Again, I don't know if I have anything wrong with me. I haven't been anywhere. I've asked her to take me somewhere but she says I'm being a hypochondriac and believing myself into a depression. I don't think so. I just want to not hurt, is that so much to ask for? I love her, but I wish she would understand.... 

I've been sensitive to arguments since an argument began this whole ordeal and has caused problems in my closet friendship. 

I also suspect social anxiety is a possibility, but I'm really not a professional. I don't know, I just know that it effects my social life in several ways. 

When I get sad, as I often do when I'm not distracted, it hurts a lot. Physically, too. Like.. In my chest or stomach. It hurts so much. I can't handle it very well, or anything for that matter. 

I don't believe I'm suicidal, but... There have been the occasional thought of wanting to die. I'm not sure though. I want to live. But... Not like this. Not suffering... 

Anyways, here's my rambling about my feelings. If you guys could help me understand them better and maybe give advice, I'd appreciate it.

"I don't see how it's supposed to help me feel or think any better. I already know that the way I think about things causes me to be depressed, but somehow I'm okay with it. It's difficult to explain. I AM my thoughts, and my thoughts aren't irrational. I'm not depressed because my ""brain is lying to me"". Why do I sit around not doing anything? Because at my core, I don't feel an intrinsic desire to actually do something that doesn't bring me immediate physical pleasure. I don't reap the intangible rewards of completing goals or learning new things. I just don't care for it. That's a fact. I guess you could chalk me up to a whining child since I clearly don't want to push myself out of the mental rut, and with that I would agree. My values don't exist anymore. I'm a shell of a person and I don't care enough to change that. That's the thing everyone who wants to help just doesn't understand. They can't help me due to philosophical reasons. There's not a thing anyone could tell me that would make me feel as if anything mattered. There's not a thing I could tell myself to change that either. I could mechanically flip the switch on that thought so to speak, but I wouldn't FEEL it. Going with it trying to fake it till I DO feel it doesn't work because it's not GENUINE. That's the thing about major depression. It is a rational reaction and it is a genuine reaction. When someone comes out of it, they don't become ""themselves"" again; they were always themselves.

"Hi. I haven't really posted on reddit before, but I really don't know any other place I can anonymously say this. 

I've had depression before, I've beat it. For a short period of about six months, I felt amazing. I didn't care about people who didn't matter, I didn't feel dark and empty inside, it didn't hurt to be alive. But something happened in the summer that has made me feel that way again. My suicidal thoughts have returned, and worse than ever. It was a time when I was the closest to actually killing myself.
I thought it was situational, that it would go away, but it didn't. It just came back and it stayed, and it manifested in a form much stronger than it was in before. 
What's worse, is that I really feel helpless now. I can't tell my family about this, they will only tell me bullshit like ""the power of you will can change this"" or whatever. I don't feel comfortable talking about this to my friends, hence me talking about it here anonymously, and my boyfriend tries to help me but I feel like nothing he is doing is helping, and it's not his fault, it's mine.

"When I am in the midst of hell, crippling, debilitating depression (much like now)  I always repeat one line from a song called ""Mamma Sed"" by Puscifer over and over again.  It doesnt help at first, but the more time that passes the more sense it starts to make.  Here is the lyric:

""Momma said, like the rain, this too shall pass.  Like a kidney stone, this too shall pass.""

I just love it because the cliche saying ""like the rain this too shall pass"" doesn't exactly capture what we go through in times like these. But ""like a kidney stone""  sums it up just perfectly.  What you are experiencing is going to hurt like FUCKING HELL.  It will be one of the most painful things you will ever go through...but...it will pass.

"First off, this is just gunna b some shitty attention seeking rant thats barely gunna make any grammatical sense so feel free to leave now and just go read something more interesting I just need to get this off my chest.

Basically im a useless, lazy, attention seeking, selfish person who literally deserves nothing even though I get so much shit for free from my parents which just makes me feel bad cos they are wasting so much time and effort into a boring, nothing person. Nearly the whole of the time I am awake is just spent thinking about how I wasted everybody else's time just doing some stupid shit that they could have spent doing something to benefit them but instead they have to sit through my shit which doesn't help anybody at all. I also started cutting my self about a week ago, nobody knows yet and I have no idea why I'm doing it when I think about it I realise I'm just cutting for fucking attention again which just makes me feel like a shitty person. My whole life is paradox, pointless and goes on for ever all I can think about is how much of an attention seeker I am which makes me depressed then I think that I'm just putting on this sadness for attention which makes me think that I'm an attention seeker again and the only way to break thing fucking endless cycle is to fucking die. Every so often I go out to walk my parents dog and because of where we live I have to walk along this busy road with the traffic coming up behind me and every single time I hear a car part of me just hopes one will just smash into me, ending it all. I'm too much of a pussy to commit suicide on purpose and that will be selfish to everyone I know anyway so I wish there was just a way to just disappear as if I had never even been alive in the first place. Another thing is that I literally have 0 hope for the future, I'm 15 now and going through my GCSEs, but my grades aren't even a problem all my expected grades are above average and fine but every single other thing that is just a complete failure I have no idea how to get a job I have no idea how fucking do anything at home except for sit on my ass and play fucking videogames I have no idea how to be sociable and make friends I have never had a fucking girlfriend and I just realised I contradicted myself with the selfishness and the girlfriend wasting time and now I'm thinking in that same fucking paradox and my life is just turning to shit. Its as if I'm being pushed closer and closer to my inevitable death and it started slow at first but I'm being pushed faster and faster towards it in the past month. Idc if nobody reads this I just have to get this off my chest which I have no idea why this shitty rant would help with anything and fuck I'm just gunna post it.

"For the life of me, I canât figure out what is keeping me from eating a fistful of pills so I can continue to do the only thing I actually want to do, sleep. I have no one. Even that backup friend I never really liked in the first place, gone. Iâm not sure how it happened. It was like one day everyone turned on me. Each situation and bridge burned is more baffling than the next. I feel like the universe is fucking with me.

For example: Last night my landlord and his wife called me together, bc I didnât pay my rent. In California we donât have to pay rent until the following day if it falls on a bank holiday. When I tried to politely explain that a bank holiday meant I cOuld not go inside a bank, I received a twenty minute lecture from them both, (because everyone talks to me like Iâm an incompetent female), about how everyone has to pay rent. 
This resulted in my driving around to various stores to get âcash backâ following a transaction bc due to daily atm withdrawal limits being$400 and the bank being closed, I had no other way to access the money in my account. So even though I went out of my way to do that series of inconvenient errands, my landlord was still had this to say: 

âI have to say this is not how it should be and I will refrain from saying more.
So, it is very late.â

To which I replied : 

âI agree so Iâll refrain as well because this is also incredibly inconvenient for me. Thatâs why there is a law for this.â

From this followed an incredibly uncomfortable in person exchange of cash. Now this where the baffling part comes in. This is what every day of my life had been like for the last six months. Itâs one giant shit on Natasha fest where this dumb incompetent girl canât possible be right. ...

As soon as I arrive home from the exchange of cash, I receive a very agitated phone call from my landlord and his wife saying that I did not hand them the correct amount of money. Lucky for me, I had some downtime in the car before the handoff, so I had counted it so many times I remembered that there were 38 twenties 4 tens and one hundred dollar bill. So in the middle of the screaming I try to interject that maybe they could tell me what bills were there so I could see if maybe one dropped in my car. As Iâm asking reportedly for him to count the number of twenties, over the screams of his wife saying not to count it again because they did and itâs not there, he finally begins to count and shockingly, all the twenties are there. Then shit gets real weird. I start having to argue basic math. Iâm on the phone and Iâm speechless bc as most people with a calculator or third grade math know, 20 X 38 = 760. So Iâm fucked. I am speechless. If they arenât going to believe math, something essentially black and white, i might as well start speaking a different language bc nothing I say matters. 

Eventually I could hear the husband starting to realize that maybe the cash did add up correctly so I gave them an out by saying maybe they wanted to call me back in a few minutes. Later I received a text saying, 
âItâs all here. Goodnight.â
No apology. 
And so is my trash heap of a life. Empty. No human relationships. No money. No passion. No desire to get out of bed. And frustrated to tears. 

I hate crying. I spend everyday frustrated to tears.

I wish I was dead.

Anyways. This is my first post to an Internet forum. I wonder if anyone actually reads this through to this part. I know I would have skimmed and skipped a long time ago. Jesus even I bore myself.

"Back in August I finally got the help I needed, and was prescribed therapy and medication. I'm overall in a much better place than I was beforehand, but I feel myself slipping back. I have dangerous thoughts, I'm crawling back inside my own head, and I left the apartment only once this entire weekend: to do my laundry so no one will notice anything is amiss tomorrow. 

Since I've been on it, I could count the number of days I've missed taking a pill on one hand. Then, over about the last month and a half, I noticed a decline.

I doubt it's a matter of increasing the dosage of my medication either. I'm on Effexor 300mg, have been for a couple months now. My provider told me that I'm already at the upper limit for medicinal dosage, so it seems that simply going up won't be an option. Which kinda sucks, as I'm not dealing with a whole lot of side effects, except for maybe memory problems, which is probably unrelated as it's historically been terrible anyway.

Before, I couldn't go an hour without considering it for at least a couple minutes. Now they're back, along with the feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing.

I don't want to go back to that, I don't want to. I want to get better. I just want to know if it's possible for medication to just... stop working like this. To work one week, and then start dropping down again. It sucks. It really fucking sucks and I just want to stop wanting to jam a fucking knife in my neck. 

So, yeah. Is that possible? For medication you've been on for less than 6 months to just stop?",5,"it's just simply a matter of it not working as well anymore, along with the feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing"
"I thought I was getting over it. But now after eight years my depression has reached a new stage. I've managed to self-medicate with video games and youtube for years, but over the past couple weeks it stopped working. Now nothing is interesting anymore. 

It's driving me absolutely bonkers. I'm so stir crazy. I'm SO BORED. But I don't want to to do anything. Nothing feels worth my time. Everything makes me feel guilty that I'm not doing something else. 

I wish I knew hot how to emphasize how bad this is. I can FEEL it inside me, like a thirst. Like I'm craving some physical thing and if it was in front of me I'd pounce and devour it like a tiger. I've always felt uncomfortable in my skin, now it's like all of me. I need to rip myself apart to tear the corruption out. 

I'm going mad, just mad. Like I desperately need a sedative or something before I spiral out of control. I've never thought more seriously about hospitalizing myself.

"Was once full of potential, playing collegiate ball, doing well in school, had everything I wanted. But a few concussions and stubbornness to get properly treated have led me to a life of constant debilitating migraines, memory issue, and general physical/mental deterioration(depression,anxiety, etc). I went from being a 220 lbs to 170 lbs because I just stopped having the urge to eat due to the constant pain in my head. Iâve seen more doctors than a person needs in a lifetime trying to solve the issues my brain causes, but Iâve reached the point of no real hope. Iâve been diagnosed with Post-Concussion Syndrome and ever since there has been a disconnect with friends and family, a loss of the person I thought Iâd spend my whole life with, and a crushing defeat in regards to continuing my education. I now spend my days tucked away in my dark room avoiding light, loud noises, and social interaction. Itâs not that I choose to isolate myself, itâs that it literally pains me to do otherwise. Iâve never truly considered self-harm, it would lead to major issues for loved ones I would never want. My friends are already all consistently irritated at how difficult it is to hang out with me, but I donât know how that makes me the bad guy (they act as if I am dodging them out of distaste for them or something). Recently I was supposed to go to a big sporting event with a friend in my friend group, but due to the growing frustrations of the others about me, my friend dropped me in order to settle down any issues. After this I found myself seething with anger, but almost to the extent that it became nothingness if that makes sense. This is mostly just a rant, itâs hard talking to anybody about all of this because no one seems to ever truly understand. Sometimes I have this burning anger in me about the way my life has changed, but lately Iâve had more of a sense of numbness. Just not caring at all about anything. I wish I could just move far away and restart but thatâs not happening, so Iâm left laying in bed in the dark contemplating what could have been had the last few years gone differently.",5,"After this I found myself seething with anger, but almost to the extent that it became nothingness if that makes sense"

"Depression and I are at a constant battle. I was home alone for Christmas Eve and it was driving me insane. I felt like ripping my hair off gahhhhhhhhhhhh! To cope with the depression I urge myself to go out. I got put my pants on and went out. I thought to myself what the fuck can be open at 8:30pm thatâs when I passed by Angel City Brewery. It was fucken open. I went inside, it was almost completely empty. I got me an IPA and started walking around, I ended up going to the balcony they have. I sat down on some of the couches they have. I started browsing Reddit like usual, reading every depression post. I was half way done with my beer when some one speaks to me. âIs some one sitting here?â I asked myself is someone speaking to me!? I looked up and itâs a girl. I remember stuttering âIâm sorry?â She repeats âis someone sitting hereâ I say âoh noâ she asked if she can join me and I say yes. Iâm looking at her while sheâs looking around her surroundings looking totally confused. She looked like a very antisocial person. I asked her if she was okay. She said that sheâs never been here before and asked why it was so empty. I chuckled and said â maybe because itâs Christmas Eve?â We both laugh. Soon and then I started feel a warm sensation in my stomach, I began feeling nervous, my depression felt like it was suffocating. 
She asked me â do they have margaritas here?â I giggled. I said no, itâs a brewery they only have beer. She looked paranoid. I asked if she was okay. She said that she doesnât really go out by herself. Then she asked me if I was waiting on someone. I said no, I usually go out alone. I kept looking at her, I asked her what was her name. She told me Maria, I introduce myself. She asked why was I here by myself. I told her I just needed to get out. 
She told me she wanted a drink and asked me if I can go with her to get her drink. I said of course. I started getting even more nervous, asking myself why is this person talking to me. We got to the bar and she ordered a drink, I ordered one for myself since I had finished mine. She grabs her pure and pull cash out and tells me âIâll payâ I responded âOh no, it on meâ she said thank you. 
She asked if they had any games here, I said of course they have board games. We ended up grabbing Jenga. We went back to the sofa I was sitting at. Iâve never played jenga before so it was my first time. Boy did I fucken suck.  We talked for a while, and told me she moved back to LA from Mexico and to pardon her bad English. I told her what you talking about you speak perfect English. As I got to know her, my depression starting go away, I felt happy, I was smiling. 
It was about to be 10pm when she told me she was feeling tired already since she had a long day. I didnât want here to leave, I was enjoying this so much. I told her that it was fine and that I was thankful for sitting with me. I walked her downstairs and we put the jenga game back. We looked at each other for a second. She asked if I wanted her number, I blanked out for a second. Then she said â you know what let me have yoursâ I gave her my number. She told me it was nice meeting me. And told me I should go home soon because it wouldnât be okay to keep drinking. We shook hands and she started walking away. I just looked at here leave the exit, I felt my depression coming back. I walked to the bathroom looked in the mirror when it hit me. FUCK I FORGOT TO GET HER NUMBER!
I rushed to the exit and to the street, all I see is a white Lexus pulling away. She was gone. 
I been thinking about her constantly, hoping she would text me or call me. I went out New Yearâs Eve alone. I kept thinking about her, how happy she made me feel. My depression was gone for that time I was with her. Yet here I am at the same brewery and the same couch her and I met drinking the same beer buzzed as shit . I just want to thank this brewery Angel City for being open New Yearâs Eve. And specially thank you Maria for coming up to me and giving me the best company I had in a while.

I have been dealing with depression for years now and have been doing everything I can to get better. Recently I have been having suicidal thoughts. And even though I have no intention of following through I feel as though my depression would. Whenever I used to get this way Iâd think of all the things I love in this world and Iâd change my mind pretty quick. But now it seems every time I try to do that those thoughts get choked out by my depression. Every positive thought I have gets drowned out and stomped on by the suicidal thoughts and general self loathing. All motivation is gone for me and this point and I do things simply so I am not a burden to people anymore. Iâm scared that in a slump of sel hatred and meaninglessness Iâll do something stupid..

"When Iâm really struggling internally, I overcompensate externally. Think Ross from Friends when he finds out about Rachel and Joey. That episode struck a chord with me because Iâve lost count of the times when Iâve tried to put on a good show and ended up looking like an absolute idiot. Iâd get all loud and animated; try to be funny; try to convince others and myself that thereâs nothing wrong. They say the unhappiest people are the ones that seem the happiest. For a large chunk of my school days, that was me. My face was laughing and smiling but my eyes werenât. In my adult life, pretending got harder until I just couldnât any more.

Why did I feel like I had to put on that front? Originally it was because I just wasnât even acknowledging to myself that I had a problem. These days itâs more fear of how people would respond if I displayed my true emotions. Some people donât âbelieveâ in depression. I donât know how, because itâs everywhere. The word âdepressedâ is flung around flippantly by people who are just upset about something or having a bad day. Maybe thatâs where the apathy comes from. People who claim to be depressed trivialise the condition for those whose lives are genuinely blighted by it.

There are unwritten rules for answering certain questions. When people ask: âhow are you?â they expect to get the statutory âIâm fine thanks, how are you?â Not: âI feel like Iâm falling apart and I canât cope,â or âI donât know how Iâll get through the day,â or some other variation of the hellish truth. That makes for a rubbish situation where, even when you get texts or actual face-to-face enquiries into your wellbeing, you skirt around it or make something up or dismiss it.

âWhat have they got to be depressed about?â

Iâve dedicated the other half of this post to tackling some of the things Iâve heard people say relating to depression. This one usually rears its head when thereâs a celebrity involved. Take Robin Williams for example. Known for his seemingly happy-go-lucky nature and vivacious sense of humour. Clearly his smile was hiding a world of pain. But heâs rich, heâs famous, heâs successful. Whatâs he got to be depressed about? Weâll never know the answer to that, but we need to stop asking the question. Or rather, we need to stop asking it in such a dismissive way. When the news broke about Aaron Lennon, it was immediately followed by references to his income and status as a Premier League footballer. Yes, there are people who have it worse economically and people who have had horrible, harrowing things happen to them throughout their lives and just âgot on with itâ but why use that as a stick to beat someone who is already at rock bottom? They will be well aware of all that. Everything youâre saying and thinking, they will have said to themselves ten times over. So then thereâs the feeling of guilt thrown into the mix; the sense that they have no right to feel the way they do. That just compounds the issue.

âDonât be so sensitiveâ

Depressionâs not about sensitivity. Some of the strongest, toughest, take-no-prisoners- type of people suffer with depression. I know because I know them. There needs to be more openness and understanding surrounding mental health and well-being. But we donât all need to be holding hands and showering each other with compliments and treading on eggshells, scared to say or do anything that may be misconstrued in some way. Far from it. When someone is in the pits of despair, the best thing you can do is just be there for them. In the most normal way possible. You donât have to do anything spectacular or extraordinary. You donât have to change your behaviour or your personality or the way you interact with them. You havenât got a magic wand. You canât fix their problems. But just being there can make all the difference. Sometimes, when wandering the corridors at work, perpetual cloud hanging ominously overhead, the sight of a friendly face coming towards me was enough to make me a bit better. If honest surveys were taken in the workplace, there would probably be a surprising number of people who are experiencing depression or anxiety, or have experienced it at some point in their lives. Everyoneâs fighting their own battles. It would be so much easier if people could join forces.

âItâs attention seekingâ

This one is dangerous, because if someone at rock bottom hears this about themselves, after theyâve plucked up the courage to disclose what theyâre going through, it can send them spiralling into further isolation and their thought patterns spiralling down life-threatening avenues. When I hear the phrase âattention-seekingâ used in relation to depression, it makes me laugh and makes me angry in equal parts. Do people really think Iâve devised this little world of hell for myself and decided to live in it just for the fun of it? That I choose to be a misery who canât see the point in anything anymore? That I consciously throw away people and things and opportunities that mean a great deal to me because I just love to make life hard for myself? The isolation, the hopelessness, the despair, the panic, the dread, the turmoil, the cacophony of emotions â all of them negative â crushing my spirit day in day out. Love all that, me.

"Hi guys,
Looking for any help I can get!
I've been on Pristiq 100mg for 10 years. (Stupidly got forced into it at 18 when my brain was still maturing). Spent the last two years on 50mg, and the last 6 months cutting it in half, then quarters, then 8ths. (I know you're not meant to cut them, but all docs seemed to have no idea what to do.)

I really haven't felt sad or hopeless since I was about 20ish, so have just been taking them as I could never get help or instructions for tapering off from docs. 

These last 2 weeks, I've stopped taking the 8th of a tablet and oh my God. 
I don't know who I am. The side effects are terrible. I am jumbling my words, mental blanking so hard that some days I can't remember how to get home, or find my car in the car park. Extremely angry and irritable, crying over everything, literally a cute freaking dog on TV. I forget basic words, today I referred to the pantry as the bathroom, just weird shit. My short term memory.. Is non existant. I just had to ask my partner to repeat what I just said to him cause I couldn't remember.  I start making up words and somehow convince myself they're a word!? (Refrigenative???)wtf. Yet I'm a lit nerd. I'm an executive too.. In the advertising industry. Words and well written sentences and quick wit are what my career revolves around. I am fucked. Would love to know if anyone else has been in this situation.. I don't know what to do. :(

"Imagine a wide, empty expanse. There is nothing but the brown crust of the earth and distant mountains, hinting that something lies beyond this place. Alone, you drive across the surface, the realization of how screwed you are slowly rising in the pit of your stomach. 

You're so far from your destination that you're not sure where it is or where you are. And the surface below you is not hard; it looks solid but the weight of the car presses into what is deep mud.  It becomes more difficult to continue forward, so you shift up and press the gas to try to keep moving; if you lose the momentum, you will  get stuck. If you get stuck, you know that this is where you'll die. The car struggles and the wheels begin to spin loose, and you sink further and further into the mud. 

Mired in the bog, climbing out you see there is no freeing the car. The sun above is oppressive and harsh, the day humid and long. Echoes of voices from family or friends ring through the mind as you broil in the heat; what is real, and what is imagined? You doubt yourself and everything in the delirium of heat stroke, but you press forward, maybe out of guilt or instinct or spite. 

But as you chase the sun, it sinks below the horizon. The night is cold, and the frost twists down your spine and into your essence. You have nothing left to propel you forward, and fall, confused in the dark, exhausted beyond despair, dying in a quiet agony, alone. That's when you realize that you can't even cry anymore, as the tears freeze your exhausted eyes closed. 

---

I feel that I've come to the point of there being no win for me anymore. I can envision steps needed to meet smaller goals, but I fail each and every time I try and take these small steps. I can't progress in my career and I can't really even afford to live anymore.   Because of that I can't take care of myself properly and I can't imagine getting out of the bog; I am mired here, with no way out and I'm not even sure which way I would go. But what I know for sure: I hate what I see in the mirror every single time I glance at it. 

I've lost most of the people in my life. At this point I think that what shadow of existence I cling to will be completely alone and absolutely cannot see growing into a normal adult relationship like every other, well adjusted 29 year old. I feel that, even if I were to reach my destination, I will continue to be alone as there is no future or meaning to life for a person like me. 

It is so soul-wrenchingly exhausting to paint on a brace face every day and to try, just to be met with more failure and to have the best possible outcome also be one of failure by any societal measure. I had deluded myself into believing that the losing hand I was dealt wasn't going to be where my story ended. Well, I don't set the rules of the game. 

I want to sleep but I can't; not now. I wish I was never born, but there is part of me that wants to live, if only out of spite at this point. I don't want to be bitter or mean, and the only win that feels possible when you've already lost the game is to try and stop caring about the rules and play on ones own terms. It won't stop me longing for the night,  so the icy hand of death can snuff me out.

The main thing that convinces me that I donât, is the fact that I havenât attempted suicide in any form yet. Although I think of it extremely often, I am very far from actually trying it. Part of me wonders if I would actually be able to go through with it, or if Iâm just being dramatic subconsciously. Mainly my issue here is that I donât want to come off as dramatic to people or insulting to anyone who actually suffers from it before I even ask anyone if I have it.

"Hi! Was just with my therapist and she suggested that when depression says âisolate yourself from your friends and familyâ, do the exact opposite. Seek them out. When anxiety says âavoid all your problemsâ, face them head on. Depression has a way of convincing you that only the worst things are true. Tell your inner saboteurs to kindly fuck off!

"Hello, in need of some advise. I have a 2 year old greyhound who I have had for 1 year and I am thinking of giving him up.

"So, Iâve come to conclusion that the worst part about depression is how easy it is to convince yourself things are fucking awful but itâs so so hard to tell yourself things are good. 

Everytime something good happens I can see a way to ruin it. Because I always ruin everything. My new girlfriend? Sheâs going to leave me because Iâm not good enough and never will be good enough to love anyone as beautiful as her the way she deserves. Maybe itâs kinder to let her go so she can find someone who really loves her and can properly show it. Not me. Not someone who sleeps all day forgets to text forgets to hang out canât even muster up the fuckin spine to tell her how I feel. 

No wonder she doesnât want to talk to me. No wonder she hates to spend time with me. Iâm a stain. Iâm nothing. To no one. Why bother?

I'm 17 I live in Sheffield, England and for the past few months I have have been dealing with depression and it is tearing me apart LISA (love you if you get that reference). In all seriousness, I feel so disconnected from everyone around me and it scares me to death. My 'friends' are all busy with relationships or with their own friend groups which is a thing I've never been apart of, I've always just had friends who had friend groups so I would be in a weird position. I often have very self loathing style thoughts and have very little to no self esteem. I feel like my friends are using me in a sense that they only call me if they need help with college work or I'm the last option because the rest of their friends were busy. I can't do anything though because I don't want to risk losing the few friends I do have. They all come to me with the stories of the great nights out or the holidays they all have planned and when they ask what I was up to, which is rare, I just have to say ""nothing"" and it makes me so deflated. I haven't felt genuine happiness in months and that is due to the lonliness, I would get back out there and look for someone but I have no confidence in myself so I'm terrified to do so.

Im not condemning anyone for expressing the pain they are dealing with, but why are there never posts or replies with constructive, helpful advice on how to move forward and make progress towards combatting this illness. The few that are posted are overlooked and ignored in favor of discussing symptoms. Someone posts on here that they often feel like killing themselves and they get a myriad of posts from people who just tell them they also feel that way.

Even if it is, I don't see what I have to do with it? Why can't I be associated with the thousands of Indian men that marched for the rapists to receive justice? Nope. Guess I can march for my country's women, get hosed by the police, but I'm still an evil Indian rapist. Great.

Now that's not something I've gotten more than twice IRL, and dozens of times online but I hardly care about the latter, but I still wanted to mention it.

Indians are seen by everyone, even Indians themselves, as undesirable. It's a pain.

Now the weird thing is that I don't even know if I have a sexuality. I sometimes imagine myself as asexual.

This is because:

1. I find breasts and women in general to be attractive

2. I am repulsed to sex and vagina (receiving oral sex or a handjob is the only thing I'm not repulsed by)

I wouldn't classify myself to be asexual, but possibly I might be?

--------

It's not even with dating or girls, I don't have romantic feelings to people or anything. I'm sick and tired of having been born flawed and ugly like this, and feeling ugly.

I don't know why I even dislike being ugly, because it's not like I care about it possibly impacting my relationships or friendships or anything like that.

For a while, I seemed to forget about my physical appearance.

Is physical appearance just the elephant in the room?

Whenever people talk about physical appearance like this, and call themselves ugly, the number one point of advice they receive is ""you're not even ugly.""

What about the fact that, according to people I've asked IRL and the internet /r/amiugly and /b/ and even this subreddit, I am ugly?

What do I do then?

""Ugly"" is literally an insult for things. I'm supposed to deal with the fact that my presentation is a literal insult?

I'm fuming.

"So, hey. 

I'm coming to this sub because... I feel empty, again. 
I just took my antidepressant for the day, and I still feel like depression is creeping in. 

About two months ago, I stopped going to school. It was either that or, you know, a mistake. I had to breathe. Two years ago, I already took a break because of depression, and saw what I could be without it. It was awesome. And now.. I'm missing school again. I feel emptier and emptier, and dumber every day. A few months ago I was doing amazing things, considering becoming something i'd never even dreamed of. Now, I have all of the possibilities for a better future, and yet i'm sinking in the terrible depths of my stupid brain. 

I can't come back to a regular sleeping schedule ; I keep thinking wht I should do today, etc. But then, my brain stops me :

""Why bother ? Nothing is important. Your success, your creation, doesn't impact anyone. And even if it did, it would be but a speck on billions of people. You're just trying to fill your time until you grow old and ultimately be alone. ""

Jesus, even typing this is horrible. But I can't stop thinking this is terribly true. I keep realizing i'm not intelligent. That it was something adults told me when I was young, I just rolled with it until the truth hit like a wall. And yet, my most happiest times were when I felt dumber. That I ignored the reality. I don't want to feel even stupider. 

I'm scared

- Ethnically i'm mostly white, however slightly not ,so i've never felt at home in white society. I also notice many things about white society that are problematic.
- Sexually i'd say i'm mostly straight. I've only ever been in love with women and sexually am only interested in women for the most part. However, I do sometimes feel affection and aesthetic attraction for some men, sort of like a crush but not sexual? This is another reason why i'm lost.

- I don't feel tied to religion or atheism.

"I'm really depressed. There's no one here to help me or to force me to get up. I've been in bed for a few days, only getting up to go to the toilet and refill my water. I haven't had any energy to make food so I've not eaten in 4 days. Just water. 

This is a particularly bad period, but even when it's better, it's still tough. I was randomly googling things like ""how to survive when you're depressed"" and one of the common pieces of advice is to be kind to yourself and accept that you're not operating at your normal capacity.

The problem is, if I'm operating only on 20% capacity, what do I do when my life is demanding at least 60%. I have so many things I haven't done. I missed a doctor's appointment yesterday, I ignored a friend's invitation today, my credit card is due to be paid in a week and even though I have the money to pay it, I just haven't yet. My fridge is completely empty aside from food that is two weeks bad. I haven't showered in 5 days. I have a massive laundry pile to do.

None of these things are unmanageable on their own, but there's just so much that I feel I can't do. How can I even begin to get help when I'm this bad? It feels like I've already reached my limit just refilling my water and going to bed.

How do I survive, in practice, when it's taking all my willpower to simply not kill myself? The guides online say to recognise the small achievements. What do you do when staying in bed and not killing yourself is an achievement? It might be admirable from some perspectives, but the world doesn't stop for chronically ill people.",5,"How do I survive, in practice, when it's taking all my willpower to simply not kill myself"
Im afraid. The suicide scale is true. Its gets progressively worse and you dont even realize it. I was at 1 contemplating death and  that was it. Now as i live i keep moving farther into the scale. Not existing is all i long for. Its all i think about. Its all i desire. Ive written 2 goodbye notes. I constantly open up the lid of pills and acting as if ill swallow them. Yesterday and today i have been making nooses with a thin belt and putting it around my neck. I squeeze so hard to simulate what its like.

For the past 5 months I have really not been the same person I used to be. I used to be a very optimistic and fun person but recently I have truly been the worst version of myself, just constantly angry and always being able to find the negative in something, I have especially have no energy to do anything. It seems my family is just too angry or disappointed in me to actually help. In this plummet I have lost a lot of friends and family members so I'm turning to reddit for any kinds of tips thoughts on how to be proactive and change this mood around for good, as I am just sick and tired of it.

Every person I look to seems to either create another problem for me in their ""help"" or has no interest in helping.

"Hi all title says most of it, the other day after yet another bad experience with ladies I had a bit of a brake down. Usually it doesn't affect me, at least I thought not. The other day after being rejected by yet another women i had been talking to for a while (6 months and 2 dates). I started to have a bit of a brake down, I had to leave to pub to stop myself from doing it in front of my mates. I started to walk down the road to sit on the harbour edge (just away from the pub). Problem is as soon as I sat down I started to cry uncontrollably, I was overwellmed by negative thoughts and feeling. I felt lonely, depressed and suicidal, for a second I even just debated jumping in. It wasn't till a mate found me and claimed me down that I went back to the pub. Problem is now I can't shake these feeling I stay up late at night thinking about it, i go to places to be alone like the beach just to cry(Yes I know pathetic). I'm on dateing sites and go out to bars/clubs with mates, but I just can't seem to find a girl. I'm shy, overweight and generally just hate myself at this point in life, I have lots of friends both male and older female. They all say I'm great and things like that I'm starting to struggle to believe them. I'm 20 years old and never even kissed a girl, while all my friends get engaged, have kids and get laid.

When I went back later that evening my baby brother told me that the doctor only gave him two months at most.

does it not know that finally being eaten is what i had desired from the beginning?

~

i was hated from the moment i was conjured

there is no way to apologize

(indignity)

so, for you i have to

bleed and i bleed and i bleed out

good, good!

good luck always will run out

i feel some heart beating when i press my hand to my stomach

but it is my own

because, were i to bring a child into this world, they would surely have a tragic existence.

ah, im so fucking horny, and then i--

oh.

i scoop out my womb like cantaloupe!

sinew sticky in-between my fingers, hair ripped from the follicles

my fingers shrink inwards

eventually, bees come to eat the nectars of my spoiled corpse

buzz buzz

hum hum

cacophonous 

this song gets sung, louder and louder, until i can't control my hatelust.

hunger.

ah.

that is what it is, and i drive the lance straight through my skull

lying peacefully in a field of flowers

hands outstretched

"I just had my 28th birthday January 2 and leading up to it, on it and since my anxiety has been on a whole new level which for me is really saying something. Iâm having mini âepisodesâ of depersonalization and panic attacks thinking how I am 28 years old and Iâve been this way for as long as I can remember so what real hope do I have of changing. Turning 30 and being like this horrifies me and honestly I think if Iâm still like this by then I might have to end it as much as I donât want to die, I donât see the point in going on like this. But rly if Iâve been like this since I was a kid and Iâm 28 now how in the hell is it reasonable to think I could change my brain and actually improve. I look at ppl I know from high school my age already married with houses and kids or kids on the way and I want to throw up at how pathetic my own life is and how feeble I am. The lives these ppl lead my own age traveling all around the world and I can barely make it through a day at work just to get home and collapse into my bed feeling like I just ran a marathon and then got hit by a truck because of the never ending physical nature of this disease. I had an uncle that killed himself years back and my 32 year old cousin killed him self last year.

"We are all meaningless and worthless. Our existence as a human species has destroyed the earth to an extent so far that there is no hope for repair. With everyone being greedy, selfish, and weak no one can stand for themselves. People can not be trusted with any information. There is always a way to extract that information. In the worlds history people have been tortured until they release precious information. Some information is serious and some not as important. This means that humans do not have the ability to safely store information. We are animals. We make choices free willingly. No one can be trusted because reality proves humans are sensitive weak fucks. Humans can be broken easily. Nothing but false confidence and pride allows us to live. There is no protection, no certainty or hope that cannot be broken. Im just a spectator. I could put down myself but that would be pointless. If im not feeling any satisfaction in this world then what is the point to keep living. I do not feel any attachment or love, or care. There is no satisfaction or any position energy or feelings that i feel as i wake up. Each day is a forced challenge. The world is not free. Out minds are psychologically abused and used by massive corporations. We do not have free thought. All our actions are watched and criticized. Media skews our perception of reality in the world. There is absolutely no freedom anywhere. Everyone who i look at is just following the schedule a forced schedule and routine that they are just programmed not to think any differently. Everything can change. There is no god. I donât want to put any energy into thinking about what is real and what is not. The only thing i seek is a satisfaction in life. Where something makes me feel comfortable and good or happy. This is not short term fake and false bullshit like drugs. Anyone with a working mind will realize those are bad for a number of reasons. But some people just go with what others say. Fuck that. Im not going to make people realize they are all programed and controlled robots. We are forced to do so many things. There is only one thing you can do if you realize everything is pointless and meaningless that is hope. You can hope for something but with out assurance that anything can disappear and be lost what is there to hope for. Your hope can be broken by everything around you. We are animals. Selfish greedy fucking animals. But we have our consciousness that separates us slightly from everything else in this world. But we are still animals. Which means physically we feel fear, sadness, pleasure, and lots of other feelings. It doesnât matter where we have come from we will all die. Why does it matter what we do if we will all die. Again what stops us from doing what we want can also be caused by religion. If we believe our actions affect us in another world then we will submit and obey. I donât know if there is a god but I donât care. If people understood that exact bit of words and realized that. Earth would be a complete shit show. But we have been dominated and controlled because most of us think we can not change some things about the world. Physically that is. We are fearful of physical pain and torment because those physical feelings stop us from being free. Because pain hurts. Humans are traped no one is free. This is why i want to be alone and talk to no one. Very few can understand and realize we are trapped. The way to controll humans is fear and pain but most importantly just not knowing the future and having uncertainty. No one is fearless or painless. Saying you have no feelings is a delusion of your mind. Every single living human has some sort of emotion that stops them from doing what they want. A simple example is our human physical feeling of embarrassment. Or shyness. I donât want to tel you what shyness is but embarrassing events are hard to understand why we become embarrassed. Some people become embarrassed by presenting in front of the class. Because our human bodys and minds feel embarrassment. Our body and mind are different although our body has an incrediblly strong indescribable connection to your mind. People are very dumb. Of course usain bolt is on steroids. They say the olyimpics are tested ok great. There are ways to cheat tests. At that high of a level of compitition anyone will do anything for a short term satisfaction. This satisfaction is either from the world or the persons mind. Sometimes both. Achievements in life are only in this life. They might make your mind feel good but its not eternal. Nothing is eternal. Everlasting. Everything can be broken. Safety is a false feeling. There is no real true safety. Unless i do not feel these warm feelings that I should. I donât know. Everything is cold, bitter, sad, depressing and i do not feel any satisfaction. Its depression or myself realizing that everything is a delusion and nothing is real. Im not crazy i just understand more than you. Unless my false sense of reality is also skewed to the point of no return. To where i feel no eternal warmth. There is no love that i feel. The only thing that separates my diluted mind is my physical body. I feel emotions like you. Pain, sad, happy, angry, depressed. These are what stops us from being free. The indescribable connection of our minds from our bodys. Our human bodys are what makes us want to live. Our human body is an animal. It controls our mind and our thoughts. We are all sick. Our body is irrational but our mind is rational. But our body will mess with our mind making humans the complex beings that we are. Again i feel no love or satisfaction. Everything i say and do is all from my body. Not my mind. My body controls my mind most of the time. I donât feel like i can control my body in a way where it will not affect my mind. Since we have a conciousness we are not gods. Since i have no satisfaction I donât want to live but my physical body affects my mind from ending it all. Maybe there is another realm, world, hell or heaven. Who knows. The uncertainty controlls us. We have freedom to sone dregree. Yes our free choices are the smallest most insignificant thing in this world. There is no attachment to anything. Why do i know all of this and feel that way i do. I do not know. I might be missing something. I am missing something its most likely comfort. Not physical comfort but the uncertainty in my mind. Uncertainty is why humans are fearing the future. Its cold dark and what is reality. What is a conciousness. There is no such thing as safety. Uncertainty and us as humans not knowing what the future holds alows religion to control us. Religion is based and controls you with out your thought because you are uncertain. No one knows the future thats what makes churches and religion wealthy and powerful. Because if you make someone hope for something good in the future then you can control them. Our unknowingness allows people to control us. Someone who we think is in authority can control us because of our uncertainty so they tell us what we want to hear. But this is a tool to control the masses. I know so much i have so much to share but my body stops me sometimes. Why do we follow what people say? Because the world has punishments for you. If you did not feel anything physically you would rule this fucking earth. Simple as that. People stop being so dumb. Many people are sheep they just follow. And it is not possible not to follow. Im loosing my thought process as my body physically drifts off to rest",5,Humans can be broken easily

Itâs like if Iâm enjoying myself heaps, like laughing with friends or watching cute animals, and realise that Iâm having fun, and that thought triggers myself to say to myself that I will never be happy and this is a fleeting moment, and that thought itself acts as âevidence that Iâm depressedâ which goes back into the cycle of negativity which de-purifies whatever enjoyment Iâm feeling.

"Iâve lived with depression for so long that it feels weird not to be depressed sometimes. I donât like it. Itâs almost as if I need my depression because itâs what Iâm comfortable with.

It makes me think about suicide a lot too because I start to think about my future, like what the point is in living or if I can really handle anymore pain. (What is the point in life anyway? Work until you die?) But then it gets even worse when I realize I canât end it, because of personal obligations based on relationships and religion. (Plus Iâd never get to finish dark souls.

Some days I just want to die;

There'd be no more days of standing by

Wondering why life is full of darkness.

Some days I just want to die,

This pain I can't hardly take...

And I'd rather plunge a stake through my heart

Than keep watching my world fall apart

Piece by crumbled piece.

The world is not my friend or yours,

It feels like nobody truly loves you

Until your lips turn blue and your skin is a lighter hue, your body burned or buried.

And how many more traumas can I carry on my shoulders

Before I stone myself to death with imaginary boulders

Because I feel like a soldier who has no more fight,

No will to live,

No pill to swallow to stop the impending hollow feeling inside?

How many more times can I die

Figuratively, but emotionally, too,

Before I can't handle any more abuse?

How many different ways can I say ""I'm dying"" before someone realizes I am not smiling?

Where can I go when people show their true intentions and I need a place to heal?

Can I come to you?

Together can we steal back our happiness?

Can we give each other something real, something normal, something lovely?

If the answer is no,

I hope you'll simply smother me

And put to rest my aches and pains.

Drain my body drop by drop

Please don't stop or call the cops...

Just do me a favor,

Erase the stains I leave behind

And find a way to smile and shine when I'm gone.

I love you unconditionally

I want to give you the best of me

Show you you're my soul

But I feel a gaping hole in my heart

A wound that stretches further apart every time I open my eyes

The size forever growing

Please, please, please

Please hear my cries

Please give me a chance to speak.

Don't mistake me for weak,

Just know I've fought for so long

And I'm trying so hard to be strong

See I think hating or loathing someone takes this huge amount of energy. You have to be conscious about it. I think that's why it's not unusual for someone who really hates them self to also be pretty narcissistic. 
But for me, it's not a big effort. I don't hate myself, I just.. don't like myself. 
It's kind of like, when you have a group of friends, and there's one person in the group and you just don't get why anyone likes them. It's not mean-spirited, necessarily, you just don't find them interesting, or funny, or smart. They're not good-looking enough for you to think that that's why people still seem to like them. And you don't think about it all the time, maybe, but it bugs you. You find yourself rolling your eyes when they talk. When they're at events you're like ""seriously? who invited them?"" 
But when they're not around, you don't even think of them. They don't take up enough of your notice- they aren't remarkable enough- for you to devote any extra thought to.

I procrastinate with college all the time even though I know it'll make life harder for me in the long run and I've left my diet slip. 

I really want to be the social, healthy, motivated and driven person that I know I can and I used to be, but it almost feels like that person is trapped and being held back inside of me unable to control the me on the outside. I feel lazy and sad and like I'm not a nice person to be around. Maybe these all seem like obvious symptoms of depression, and maybe they seem like they're obviously not symptoms of depression and they're something else, but I just don't know, I'd be really grateful if someone could let me know if they think I should see a doctor about depression or if they think I need to do something else. I don't want to ask people to diagnose me or anything like that, and I really don't want to come across like I think it's that easy to diagnose or anything, I just don't really want to talk to friends and people irl about it, I think I could be more honest here and I think people here could be more understanding and knowledgeable about everything tbh. Thanks a lot guys, it feels nice to be able to get it all out in the open! ",5,feel lazy and sad and like I'm not a nice person to be around
"Hi, does anyone else cope pretty well during the day (by keeping busy, staying relatively productive thus numbing out your emotions) and then completely fall apart at night? 
I've been doing pretty okay during the day, but at night I am almost always suicidal. Yesterday, I cried from 7PM to 1AM and it was completely exhausting. It took everything out of me and I just wanted to end it all. 
But then, by the morning, I am almost completely fine? Like i don't even feel depressed or suicidal at all... and then I invalidate my depression and I question if I do really have it or not? 
But then the cycle continues... suicidal at night, okay during the day, questioning/invalidating my depression and then suicidal at night again. Other times I just feel completely numb and dissociated and as if I'm floating and living in limbo and just existing but not actually living.

"Iâm so fed up of this illness ruining my life. Itâs been there the whole time, itâs been affecting my ability to progress, but because Iâm intelligent and I have good days where I can do really well, I was denied any acknowledgement that I am unwell by doctors for years, until last month, during a really low dip, a crisis day, when a doctor admitted that I am not well and gave me medication for it. I was told I couldnât continue at college because of the effects it had on me, the time off I had to take, the low self worth. Iâve had so many days off sprinkled throughout my time at work. Iâve had to take one today because I was just completely paralysed with physical fear this morning, at nothing at all, and all day Iâve been panicking at tiny everyday things, like getting a letter, needing to use the bathroom, needing to clean up from making food. Iâm so scared that Iâm going to lose my job. I donât think people believe how debilitating this is for me on these days, they think Iâm being lazy or weak, that maybe Iâm just not coping with a normal bad day that everyone has and chickening out or using it as an excuse, because a lot of the time Iâm either able to present myself as capable and functioning, or Iâm actually feeling great and normal and a whole world away from this shit. I just am not physically capable today of very simple things. 
I donât have the energy to talk through all of the shit Iâve dealt with and all the things Iâve felt and to tell all of this to whichever medical professional for them to then dismiss it all and tell me thereâs nothing there and they wonât help me. Itâs too much and I donât know how to organise it all or prioritise what to say. So I got to the point of just not telling them much at all, whenever friends or family who cared about me told me I must go to see a doctor, and then obviously that all goes on record saying Iâm pretty much fine every time. 
Iâm just scared that when I feel better in a few days, Iâll have ruined it all for real me. When the fog lifts and I do give a shit about life again and feel normal itâs fucked up. ",5,just am not physically capable today of very simple things

"*There is so much great feedback on Reddit and I'm really hoping to benefit from it please. The following is my stack and some background information.*



I saw an Adult ADHD Specialist last month and he said while I've been treated primarily for *ADHD-PI* (diagnosed by Psychologist and follow ups with Psychiatrists) it is NOT the root cause of my *depression* and *anxiety.* My ADHD-PI and Anxiety are result from my depression ...mind blown ...I've been running the wrong way for 10yrs now?!



Disappointed as I really wasn't expecting this; I wrestled with it for a bit but then finally accepted it and am moving fwd. My doctor read the report and added 25mg of Aventyl to my bedtime stack. A couple weeks later my family was worried as I was severely depressed and upset for many reasons. I saw another doctor and he doubled the 25mg of Aventyl to 50mg and introduced Siv-Escitalopram (10mg) to be taken in my morning stack. 

    

I'm a little worried as he and the pharmacists warned me about **[Serotonin Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome)**. I also have been told/read that if you mess with your brain chemistry too much it could wake up a dormant bipolar disorder in you, that is if bipolar disorder is in your family history - and it is.

    

I don't drink often (1-2 drinks a week), eat 3 balanced meals (eggs and asparagus, bulletproof coffee, protein and veggies, aim for low sugar), and jog every other day.

AM (w/food): 

* Siv-Escitalopram (10mg)

* Wellbutrin (300mg)

"For years, I have battled depression. I have battled suicidal ideations. I thought to myself, hospitalization and IOP would do the trick. Would get me out of this state. However, I realized a few days ago, maybe a week, that IOP doesn't give a shit about me. They just care about my insurance copay.

I am tired. I realized that I will never get better. My life is shit. I don't care about my job, I am barely hanging on to my life in general. I am losing friends by the minute. Why the fuck does my life even matter?

I just wish I had a gun, a rope, something, to end this misery. That's what I am right now, miserable. Not just now, for the past week, I have been miserable. But, the fact of the matter is, I don't want to get better anymore. The only way people know how treat me is to hospitalize me or IOP me or PHP me etc...

I want to be neurotypical.  It sucks there's no cure for depression, you know?  And that NT people have no fucking frame of reference talking about depression, like I have no frame of reference talking to someone with bipolar, which brings me to my next point.

Depression isn't ""really sad,"" you can't even fucking be sad when you're depressed.  You can't enjoy the things you used to enjoy.

"We are all constantly searching for happiness in life and this is nothing more then the love emotion.

Why is it so important and powerful though?

The love emotion gives us so much in our lives that most are not aware of.

It is the ultimate emotion that gives us energy, motivation, happiness, intellect and clarity, health, makes us feel whole and contempt, increases our intuition that will give us the right questions to ask, give us the answers we need and ultimately push us towards our true personal purpose.

Did you realize it did all of this for us??

We constantly need to refill this love energy in ourselves without even knowing it. Most of us do it through the wrong ways that will have it fluctuating up and down causing an imbalance within ourselves.
We can do this from manipulating others of their energy, using substances, watching TV, using our cellphones, spending money, and the list goes on.

It does not have to be this way though and is not the best route. We can constantly have the love emotion in us and can do it in a beautiful way with ourselves without it fluctuating.

How can we hold the love emotion naturally?

We can receive and hold this beautiful emotion in us through the beauty of the natural world.
Through nature, the environment, animals, real food, ourselves, and even people if we do it the correct way. The energy is abundant and unlimited so it is not needed to manipulate others for it or do it in the non-beneficial ways.

Allow yourself to embrace the beauty of the natural world and have the love fill yourself completely.

Let go of your ego as it will just try to survive and destroy love.
Where love lives, ego cannot survive. It's only goal is to bring you down through selfish means and scare you into thinking love is not the answer.

Love is truly magical when you allow it to completely engulf yourself.

When you apply it correctly you can have all the benefits mentioned above. You will magnify in life and have an aura that will attract all the most beautiful things you ever wanted in you're life.",5,"manipulating others of their energy, using substances, watching TV, using our cellphones, spending money, and the list goes on."

"So I posted this on facebook to share with the handful of friends I know that are also suffering from mental illness. Unfortunately it was met with a wave of ""GET HELP"" messages that were not warranted or asked for. 

So I'm going to share it here with you folks and hope that it helps at least one person.

_____________________________________________________

I want to share something with all of my friends that are suffering from depression, anxiety or other mental illness. It's something I've been trying to do since I moved and I'm making it my official new years resolution. I won't promise it will work for you. We're all different, but it has helped me.

Every day pick one productive thing to get done. Just ONE. Even if it's something insignificant. Especially on the days you just want to stay in bed and wish for death and you can't find any motivation to do anything else.

Even something as simple as washing your hair. Wash that one pan you've been letting 'soak' in the sink for the last three days. Do one load of laundry and actually fold it and put it away. Sweep your kitchen floor. Vacuum your living room. Wipe your kitchen counters. Just one thing, even if it only takes 5 minutes.

Sometimes you may even find that overcoming that initial inertia gives you enough energy and motivation to do more. Maybe you clean the whole kitchen instead of just doing that one dish. But don't worry if it doesn't. As long as you do the one thing.

Just doing one productive thing each day can make you hate yourself a little less and feel a little less worthless.  And maybe when you come home from work and walk into a slightly cleaner kitchen you'll have a little feeling of satisfaction that is often elusive to those of us suffering with mental illness.

It's not a cure or anything. It might not even work for you. I don't know. I just wanted to share something that has helped me a little. Maybe it can help you too.

_____________________________________________________

That's what I posted on facebook but I want to lay down some rules for this exercise. 

1. **Don't** make a 'to do' list. Writing down everything you need / want to get done and having a big list to look at can be incredibly overwhelming and may cause you to recede further into your illness and retreat. We don't want that. Pick the one thing you want to get done either the night before or that morning and just do it. 

2. Your basic responsibilities such as going to work and feeding your children / pets does not count. Most of us have already learned to go through the motions of doing these things without reaching out of our comfort zone. Pick something you would normally procrastinate on or not do at all. 

3. Do it every day no matter what. No matter how shitty you feel or how badly you want to stay in bed. Staying in bed and doing nothing only feeds into our sense of worthlessness and self hatred. Get your ass up and at least do the one thing, even if you go right back to bed afterwards. If you are having an extraordinarily bad day pick the easiest thing you can possibly think of to get done and do it. Even if it only takes 30 seconds.

4. Allow yourself forgiveness if you don't complete your task to the extent that you originally wanted to. Beating yourself up is counter productive to the point of the exercise. Quoted from one of our members that suggested this rule.
&gt;I've been doing this and it does help. I am also more forgiving of myself. If I did have something I wanted to do, but didn't get it done I tell myself: it's okay, at least you got x,y,z done, and next time you should try to do x,y,z better. Really really really helps. 

_____________________________________________________

Please feel free to share / discuss any other rules for this exercise that should be added.

And of course PLEASE share with us how / if it's working for you. Tell us the things you accomplished today and in the future. 

For me today I cleaned my critter cages and took one of them that is no longer in use out to my garage and vacuumed the room I keep them in.

___________________________________________________

TL:DR (though I urge you to read at least the basic rules of the exercise) Do one productive thing a day no matter what. It might help you feel a little less worthless and demotivated. ",5,ductive thing each day can make you hate yourself a little less and feel a little less worthless

I never chose to have any loved ones or family, which at this point really just prevent me from killing myself; I don't want anyone to love me, I don't even want help, I just want to stop existing. I constantly feel like I'm drowning as if I was tossed into a whirlpool and I can't get out no matter how hard I flail. I feel like a failure every step of the way because I'll never live up to anyone expectations, not even my own. I'm so lost. I didn't want any of this and I still don't but I can't end it because of earthly ties I didn't want in the first place. At this point I just feel like I'm waiting for my mind to finally snap and completely stop caring, and just kill my self.

"When daydreaming my mind brings up negative memories. In any situation, in any location my mind will simply wander and bring up pessimistic memories instantly. I'll often be left pondering ""why did I do that?"" - ""why did I say that?"". These will often be memories or sort of quick snapshots of uneasy moments in my life that will flash through my psyche as soon as I have a spare moment.

It's happened on the train, when at work and socialising with friends. The odd thing is that the memories vary in date - it could be something I said last week, to something I did at a party when I was like five years old. The underlying factor is that all of these memories will have negative associations and will leave me questioning my actions, thoughts and responses at the time. It seems as though I have no control over what memories or images appear - I have been overheard saying ""How can I even remember that!"" when peculiar or seemingly distant images re-appear.

Does anyone else have any similar experiences with this? And apologies if this is not the correct Reddit for this post.

this is the true nature of suicide prevention. it isn't about me, i'm a lost cause... it's about not hurting people who actually matter. i know it shouldn't be this way but it just is, i know for a fact i'm not a worthwhile person, i've had it shoved in my face many times recently.

"Long post coming ft. an overreaction of the year. Just had to vent this somewhere, wasn't going away.

So I just rece a message from someone. I had asked them to play, and they replied back with ''no hi or hello?''. It's just another one of the things I forget. Basic social rules like saying hi. Maybe it's the case that I've always been a cold and clumsy person, but I was forgiven for it when younger because of still being outgoing and trying to be positive around others. Now I can barely tell what I do wrong anymore, it just seems to be everything in so many parts of life. I'm an idiot. I've tried to be more caring but still feel so disconnected and unappreciated by others. It's not like being appreciated is what I'm entitled to. It's the contrary, and on the bright side maybe that could have its benefits too. You won't get any unwanted attention if you don't want to, you can just keep to yourself and people will respect that.

What makes me feel worse is that despite trying to connect others, I can't seem to. There's always that doubting and fear that I'm doing something wrong. Accidentally offending someone, not asking interesting enough questions, sounding lazy. Even if I change to seem more positive or confident (though no one has even pointed out that I seem negative!) it doesn't seem to make any difference. People react weirdly to me anyways. I feel like I can't even have small talk without it being noticed how awkward I am, how no one really gives a fuck, how my mind is blank and I have nothing fun to talk about. I feel like I've been contaminated and can't do anything right despite my best efforts. Almost never share negative feelings  with people either, so that's not the issue despite what this pity post might let someone think.

I'm 22. I haven't been *depressed* For my entire life... I can think of times when I have been extremely happily (mainly middle school), and very functional despite having mild depression, such as in highschool (prior state ranked athlete), but I was wondering if people with major depression (such as myself) or bipolar disorder, or even other mental illnesses are living in a constant genetic predisposition to depression, in which (when they're off medication), their mind/thoughts/senses are always in a strings length of a depressive episode.

For instance, picture an Instagram filter than is dark and bleak. I have always been a dark/unlively person and I learned to find bliss and stress reduction in my seemingly cloudy lifestyle/outlook. My ""happy"" emotions are mainly nostalgia and excitement. Like i said, i have been happy at certain points in my life, but i still always have that ""filter""... And sometimes I take solace in it.

I wanted to remember that, so it's just what I did. Been a *long* time so I had to do some digging, and almost got stuck in the memories held by all the crap in storage, but I found it.

"Here we are again, in the middle of the night with nothing but the thoughts of failure, loneliness and fear of the future. I've been here so often over the last 10 years it feels like home. And has it really been 10 years? Unfortunately, yes. 10 years of depression. 10 years of anxiety issues interfering with my daily life. 5 Years out of high school and all I can count is the number of things I've fucked up. Dropped out of college. Been through 6 under-paid jobs that had me working 12 or more hours a day to exhaustion and panic attacks. That one really kills me. For the longest time panic attacks weren't something I had to worry about. I had maybe 3 from age 13 to 18. Then retail happened to me and I started having one a month. Then it turned into 1 a week. Then it turned into having problems leaving my house and jumping at the sound of a car starting. I suppose I've worked through part of that. I don't jump at everything anymore, and I managed to get out of the house some but being in public for any extended period of time still makes me nervous. I ran out of friends somewhere 2 years ago when I realized that my entire friend-group only hung around because I was a convenient source for weed and car rides. The last roomates I had were more my children than friends, since I had to constantly pick up after them to keep some organization in my living space, and constantly woke me up in the middle of the night bringing groups of drunk people over. I went straight after that. No drugs, no alcohol, no smoking. I still miss smoking. It gave me some amount of comfort in hard times, but you can't keep doing a thing that's killing you. Or so they say. I still have the urge to live, otherwise I would have kept the habit even when I started coughing up blood most mornings.
But the period of severe anxiety and depression before I did give up everything drained what meager savings I had accumulated. I was so afraid to leave the house that I quit my job, ordered delivery every day, and tried to drown my sorrows in alcohol and weed. There went 2k in a matter of months. What a waste. I could have bought into Bitcoin with that money. 
My mom had recently moved back into the state. I had no idea until she showed up on my doorstep every other day when my phone service went out. She helped me get out of the shit house I was staying in, gave me a place to stay and food for the last month, but I can tell her patience is running thin. In the beginning it was all ""OMG let me help you!"" ""We'll take you to a therapist"". That lasted all of a week before it was on to the same drivel I got growing up about getting a job. Meanwhile, I can't get even get McDonald's to call me back anymore. -.- I don't really think I need to talk to a therapist. Drugs aren't going to improve my situation all that much. Getting a call back from even the lowest of the pizza delivery places around here would help. A lack of inflation driving school tuitions and hence my student loans sky high would help. But drugs? I doubt it. If the drugs that helped me decide to STOP doing drugs didn't help, then the one's to dull my mind and make me ok with slaving for 12 hours a day on a wage that won't pay for an apartment without room-mates sure as hell aren't. But that comes too close to playing the victim for comfort. I don't want to be a victim, I don't want sympathy, I just want to do something productive that makes me not feel like shit, and lets me afford my own space. Does that sound like too much to ask? Really, someone should tell me because from my POV it doesn't, but I may not be thinking in the clearest terms anymore. My experiences of the last 5 years certainly seem to point in this direction. But whatever the case may be, thanks for reading, if you have. It's a release of some sort to put my thoughts down on paper.",5,"thoughts of failure, loneliness and fear of the future.

"I sometimes wish the world would end. Still here, I am awake, haunted by the sound of a subtle whisper. Though there's nothing left, cities sleeping that never before have heard rest, there's a feeling yearning; aching, hurting inside like pressure in an ear. If there was nobody, would you know? Recalling events of loss, you remember voices you have once heard before this time of nothingness disappearing after their loss... Soon enough you hear the news.
Am I insane? Who is this? Why is this happening? The subtle comfort of solidarity, though terrifying, luls me into comfort, still I hear this voice....
Still here alone..., where? 
We soon make plans.
Rendezvous. 
Nobody cares when. We have all the time in the world right? 
Paris. France. That's the destination.
The trip was not difficult, just long. Boats and gas are plentiful. Anyone... All two of them could break into the library now... There are so many...
Finally here... I wait. 
Nobody. It never was... I was wrong. I have learned nothing. I still wait and look but there's nobody in sight... I guess this really is real life...


I used to have this wish, and that some way, some how, I would meet her... Still getting played time and time again... I don't think it would end the way I hoped. We wouldn't meet. We wouldn't find love. There would be no hope, Or it would all be insanity from the start",5,"Nobody cares when, We have all the time in the world right"
"I don't know where else I can go to talk about all of this, so here goes I guess. I'm a 19 year old male and I feel like my life is already over. My dad refuses to apologize for running out on us when I was 3 years old; my mother says he only picked me up twice from the time I was born until I could walk. 

My first memory is of my older sisters begging me to eat my dinner because the sun was setting and we didn't have any power, and I had to eat so we could go to bed when darkness came. I was 3 at the time, and they were 12 and 9 years old, respectively. My dad repeatedly cheated on my mom while she was deployed overseas and spent weeks at a Motel 6 across town, leaving us to fend for ourselves, and we would have starved had my oldest sister not called the school and gotten one of her teachers to come give us groceries to hide from him. We were afraid to call the police because he might come back and beat us or worse. We were just kids, I don't know what else we could have done and it's in the past now so who cares. 

The few times he did come back, he would take away the groceries we had and take all the money in my sister's piggy bank. 
Over the past decade my siblings and I have rolled through the years binging on drugs, buying from the internet and selling them to get my next high. My nephew was taken by CPS when my sister almost died from a week-long binge on meth. 

My stepfather is an idiot but means well, and he's about the best I could ask for in a time like this, but as much as I try, I can't fill the void my dad left. He tries to talk to me now, but refuses to apologize or even acknowledge the terrible things he did. I don't think I can ever forgive him, and I don't know what to do.
I don't want to go back to the drugs, but it would be so easy to run down to the supermarket and get a bottle of cough syrup for under 5 bucks to make me feel a little numb for a few hours. 

I tried to kill myself a month ago and spent 3 days in a psych ward which helped only in the way that I would do anything to get out of there, even lying about my mental state in order to get discharged as soon as possible. I've been prescriped antidepressants and xanax and i have a solid couple of best friends that I'm closer to than anyone in my family, but they're going back to college at the end of this winter break and I'll be stuck in my shitty hometown with no prospects for the future.
I worked as an EMT for a few months after getting my certification about a year ago, but I saw some shit that still haunts me every night.

I don't know what to do, where to turn, or who can help me. The suicide hotline tells me that they have to move on to another caller after 10 minutes of talking and I don't want to give them my address or they'll call the police like last time. I'm scared, and alone, and I don't know what to do.",5,"older sisters begging me to eat my dinner because the sun was setting and we didn't have any power, and I had to eat so we could go to bed when darkness came.

"Dealing with my friend's suicide has gotten ... Really bad. To the point of not eating very much for the last month or so. My parents had come over to help me clean on Saturday and I had a headache so I could do little to help, but I tried my best. Tylenol didn't work. My dad ended up getting upset that there's ""always something wrong with me."" He also said a bunch of other bullshit stuff about depression after I had to remind him what I'm dealing with and why I am physically not well at the moment. Ended up locking myself in the bathroom, my cat worrying outside, until they left.

My mom texted me later that she had a talk with him that depression affects everyone differently, and he needs to be more understanding. I explained a little more about my dismal sleeping and eating habits, and clarifying my seemingly growing problems. Fine, we're good. Still pissed because he comes off as very heartless when it comes to depression. He's never been there himself, but my mom has, obviously I have, and their other kid (who I do not associate with for unrelated reasons) also has.

Today my mom came by again, and she keeps going on about ""why don't I do x or y"" and I explain that everything feels like it's lost meaning in all of this. 

And then she pulls the most bullshit line. Again. I have called her out so many times over the last almost 6 years, and I just don't understand how she can still say shit like this after having dealt with depression herself.

""Don't be depressed, you just have to think positive.""

Fucking wish i'da thought of that 6 years ago. Or 5, or less. /S

I'm on celexa but it's not working, waiting for my doctor to get my records from my old therapist so I can finish paperwork for a psychhealth evaluation. My hobbies bring me no joy, I had to quit one job, my other boss has made me feel absolutely unappreciated as an employee. At least my appetite is coming back so I'm getting back to.... Sort of normal... I just don't know how to deal with her when she does this. It's not the first time, and I'm sure it won't be the last, and I always explain very clearly why that's just simply not possible but... It just never really sets in. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated at this point. I'm lost enough, I don't need to deal with this too right now.",5,"Dealing with my friend's suicide has gotten, Really bad, To the point of not eating "

"Iâm suffering depression and anxiety, and Iâm just ... sick of it. I was doing well, hanging out with my dad ... then my friend asked me how work was going and I just started crying again. 

This is so not me! Iâm not a crier! Iâm someone strong who can fucking do what needs to be done, when it needs to be done. Iâm so sick of feeling weak and vulnerable. This is not who I am.

And then when I went to acupuncture today. Again. Totally fine, toddling through life, walk into the acupuncturistâs office, he asks me how Iâm going, and ... bam. Tears. 

I donât mind crying when thereâs a cause. And to be honest, I actually donât usually cry when there IS a cause. So to be crying when there isnât a viable cause ... it just feels pathetic.

I had thoughts of suicide while at the acupuncturist. I donât, usually, and I know that by putting it out there like this, thereâs a greater chance that I wonât - I wouldnât, anyway - but ... itâd be a lot easier for me. Not anyone else, I know. But itâd just stop everything for me. 

All I could think was life would be easier if I was a crow.

Eat healthy and exercise! I did. I started at 240 lbs. Got down to 180. Then I went on meds and went back to 220. 

Talk to people! I did. Now they don't talk to me or they're weird around me.

Get professional help! I did. They either didn't know what to do or they told me to go talk to someone else in my government's healthcare.

Take time for yourself! Ok I'm staring at a wall and my thoughts are racing now what?

Journal! Tried that, ended up with me just bitching about my problems to myself. Wasn't very helpful

Focus on your hobbies! Hard to do that when nothing interests me anymore.

Make goals and follow through! Ok I did them now what?

Take medication! I did. For almost a year. All it did was either do nothing, give me horrible anxiety in which I couldn't move, or didn't help and just made me gain weight.

Also great to hear that depression never really goes away it just gets easier to manage. What's the point? Living life for the sake of living just seems pointless to me. There are so many people who'll say there's so much to live for or that it gets better. What if it doesn't?

Sometimes i would rather not exist or atleast, have a purpose a drive to live, for i always feel numb, there are brief moments were i can have good times but it takes all my being to maintiain. 

I sit here  wondering if there will be any true enjoyment in life, from what im surrounded by the drivel of normal life, is that what my fate is? a life of mundane bullshit of pointless relationships of sitting around doing nothing at all and even when something good comes along eventually it leaves that is the duality of life misery and happiness both ever flowing rivers which is not a bad thing, if it were not  for the fact that the ""good times"" seem to feel empty still  in the end there is still no reason no purpose we exist just waiting for the day we die.

In all things i thought had meaning, things that i thought i had pleasure in doing feel more and more empty to the point where i dont think i truly enjoy anything. So where does that leave me with no purpose no enjoyment just the goings of noraml life that is what i have to look foward to? in a sense that is hell, i can enjoy it for a while but not much longer than a month for i cannot exist just to enjoy life and have fun or some bullshit about finding love, pfff  that crap never lasts most of us fear loneliness, that is why we marry or spend long times with one person but eventually you will get tired of that person or they will lose their interest.

I have no idea why i feel the way i do, as if im completely blank that the idea of continuing this drives me insane i could not endure this. In the end i still do not understand how i feel im lost utterly searching for reason, but i doubt i will find it in this existence.

I'm much more ready to get happy seeing something than I was, and maybe this was due to some desparation to get out of the vantablack-coated hellhole that I fell into, but slowly I started to look at life as string of vignettes, with a moment of quirky charm thrown in sporadically.

Rejection is a bummer, but if you also get the occasional date from trying, then it makes up for it. The problem with that is that the people like me who only ever get rejected feel even more like shit and don't want to put themselves up to that repeatedly.

I am not sincere too. Sometimes I wanna get in between that rotten, stinky pile of meat you've stayed in between and feel safe. I can not live loneliness properly. 

To be alone is like a suicidal person stays between death and life. Those who dreaming death, those who see death as salvation, those who want to die think about that because their hope is fading. But the hope that has been left in his pocket allows him to continue for a while. There are also similar hopes in the people that alone. The lonely people waits for someone, wants to find someone. As long as you remain alone you will lose hope, knowing someone, having the ability to communicate with someone. The prospects of getting rid of loneliness are weak as long they are alone.

The only person who is obsessed with death is the only one who has a chance to get away from loneliness and to survive as long as he has spent time there. The ability to survive. It has not been too long.

sorry for my english. it is not my first language and i've learned it myself, so it's not good, bad actually... whatever, i hope you'll understand what i meant.

These are some things that happen to me when I have a bad day, and please, if you expierence the same or have anything to say about these, let me know: I usually want to eat salty foods. I don't get extra hungry, but I crave chips and popcorn. Stuff like that. I masterbate a lot more. I don't necessarily want to sleep more, but I like to lay in bed more. I get antisocial. I get the urge to start using again, although I know that if I do, it will only make things worse so I don't. I take comfort in smaller things. Usually stuff like videogames and youtube videos. Anyone have anything similar?",5," I get antisocial.I don't get extra hungry, but I crave chips and popcorn.  I masterbate a lot more."
"Possible triggers coming up.

I've built myself into a robust, hermit, cold, sociopathic character, but every once in a while who I would have been if my life went differently bursts through. I'm known for being extremely isolated in my family, and I have forced myself to be okay with being lonely, and it worked, it's my preferred state and I love it. But sometimes something goes off and I just realize I need people. I crave people. Therapists struggle to understand me(do you have any idea what an alienating feeling that is? This guy is supposed to fucking know, and he's looking at me like I'm a nut job), what about friends? What about a girlfriend? I failed high school, I'm alone, I have no skills nor do I want any, I don't believe in school in the first place, I don't believe in dedicating my life to some worthless fucking job, fuck that. I didn't ask to live and I'm not okay with the way I'm being forced to live. All this stress people talk about is stress that was created and it doesn't need to be there, and old fucks tell you 'when you grow up you'll understand' like I don't understand it, you're just accepting it, you're not okay with it, it doesn't make anymore sense, you just conformed and that's not okay, you're putting your ass in the air and you're just accepting that you're getting fucked, and you're okay with that because it's easy. I don't want to conform. I don't believe in this, I'm not built for this, I want to die. I am afraid, I'm alone, and I fear that I won't last any longer. I'm scared. I'm fucking frightened. I'm sick of people trying to push 'meaning' down your throat. Not a thing means anything and I will never not believe that. I don't give a fuck about what valuable skills you think I need to have. I want to live the way I want to live, and there's nothing wrong with that, and I'll never not feel like that and because of this I'm going to die, either soon and painfully. Or I'm gonna accept it and fucking kill myself, because I WILL NOT be able to cope with it for long. 

Edit: I feel obligated to just mention this. If you feel like dieing, get yourself help. If you feel without meaning, look into existential nihilism. Please don't kill yourself, and try to become happier. Get help.

"This is the first time I'm making the conscious effort to enjoy myself rather than wallow in my depression and self pity because nobody invited me to a NYE party. I've never before taken steps towards self care so that in itself is an accomplishment and I'm proud of it. Will I be back to my self destructive and self pitying ways soon? Who knows, but for just one day I'm going to allow myself to take care of me and if you've been looking for any encouragement or a sign to do the same then hopefully this is it. I've decided nobody gives a shit that you're laying in bed crying and the only person who can make me happy is myself if I just allow myself to enjoy things. Instead of purposely listening to that sad music when I'm already sad, I'm going to listen to my dumb 70's upbeat playlist.


Today is no different than any other day except for the fact that society deems it the start of a new year when in reality time is just a construct. The idea that you need to be around other people on NYE in order to have fun is also another construct. The sun will still set and rise like it does everyday.


If you give in to looking at social media you will see people getting drunk and what appears to be having fun. Realize that yes, some of these people are genuinely out having a good time, but a majority of it is making things appear better than they really are. They're not posting pictures of people sitting on a chair scrolling through their phones (which is what happens for 90% of the time at the majority of parties), they're posting pictures where everyone came together and posed like they're having fun and shit is wild and right after the camera shutter goes off they're back to scrolling on their phones. Some of them are probably feeling fed up and wishing it was over. Some of them probably feel just as alone as they do when there's nobody around (and that's truly a worse feeling). I know this was true back when I used to get invited to parties. You, on the other hand, are at home surrounded by things you can enjoy. Movies, TV, video games, books, hobbies like drawing, you name it. Would you really be happier at that party?


Anyway, I'm going to wrap this post up because, like I said, I have a day of fun shit to do by myself. If you're not ready to take the step towards self care, I get it. I've been depressed for a hell of a long time and never taken this step. But today I woke up and decided to do it. It'll happen for you eventually if it's not happening now. Happy NYE guys.



My plan as well as tips for tonight:


- Starting off eating a nice pot brownie that I've been saving (Also for the first time, I'm getting high because it's enjoyable, not as an escape)


- Watch a movie (Never seen The Wolf of Wall Street and I think I'm going to try it out tonight)


- Watch TV shows (I've been watching The Office lately)


- Play a video game (I've been into Battlefield 1 and Civ 6 lately)


- Depending on how high I get, watch Planet Earth (On a more serious note, shit puts things into perspective and reminds you how fucking cool the planet where we live is. People might suck sometimes, but nature is beautiful as fuck. The colors and scenery are amazing but I'll probably be high as shit crying when I see the predator killed the prey only to bring the food back to its own babies)


- Fireworks get to me pretty badly, so if they get loud I'm going to put headphones in


- Limit social media use (I know I won't be able to stop myself from checking, so I'll just remind myself of what I typed earlier when I do)


- Eat good food (Try making something new or order out your favorite food)


- Give my dog a hug and a treat at midnight


- Get a good rest and wake up tomorrow like I do everyday

I advise you to make a list like I did and if at any point you feel yourself drifting into self pity or whatever else, try to read it and do something on it to get you back on track to a good night :)",5,The idea that you need to be around other people on NYE in order to have fun is also another construct.they're posting pictures where everyone came together and posed like they're having fun 
"What if I have an amazing family, and amazing boyfriend, amazing friends, amazing schooling, amazing financial status. 

What if I have no reason to be depressed? 

All of my family is coming over this afternoon to enjoy the night and I'm crying in my room, afraid and tired. 

But all I can think about is how tired I am of life. How nothing is bringing me joy anymore. I have no reason to live. 

Is anyone else feeling this way? Please PM me. I feel so done.

I've been like this before but being in the UK mental health services are absolutely dire so I was just told 'what do you have to be so depressed for? You have everything to live for!' and stuck on a waiting list for therapy which I waited 6 months for and it was totally pointless. This time I won't even bother turning to anyone for help. I can't stand being around my husband because he asks if I'm ok every 5 minutes when I just want to scream at him to leave me alone.

"I don't know that it does much good, for me or anyone else, but I'm going to talk about my situation right now. I just turned 26 a few weeks ago, make decent money working for the military, get straight A's in my college classes, have a loving and supportive family, and am physically fit.
Despite all this, I'm one very sad, lonely bastard. But I didn't used to be...about 3 weeks ago, I was suddenly punched in the soul with a powerful depression that I can't seem to shake. 

Things I enjoyed doing before don't interest me at all. I spend most of my time sitting in bed reading about depression and listening to sad music. Interestingly, the cause of this depression seems to be lonliness. This is strange for me, because I've always been an introvert...I've always preferred to stay alone and would often make up excuses for why I couldn't go do stuff with friends. I've always been very happy and content knowing that I would live, and die, alone. Until now. Now I can't stand the idea of being alone. I want to go out and meet cute girls...but I can't...being introverted is so ingrained in me that I can't seem to go out and meet people. Oh, I've gotten out a couple times...I'll go to a bar, take a seat in the back, drink a couple beers alone then head home without a word to anyone. And then I beat myself up for failing at what I was supposed to do.

 I'll swipe right on a few hundred girls on tinder and get 1...maybe 2 matches. Which takes me into the second part of my issue. I have had an ongoing habitual porn habit since I was 13 years old. I've become so used to the beauty and figures of porn stars that I have a zero percent attraction to most average women. So here I am, a lonely person with standards that rule out all but the best of the fairer gender. How messed up is that? I think ""hey, what about that hefty girl over there, she looks lonely"" and immediately dismiss the idea because appearently I'd rather be miserable and borderline suicidal than settle for a big girl. Yay my brain...thanks bud. 

So anyway...that's about it. Crippling depression getting worse each day because I don't have a hot girlfriend. Does it make sense to you? Me neither...",5," the cause of this depression seems to be lonliness, I can't stand the idea of being alone, I can't seem to go out and meet people. "

"Hey ya'll. 

I'm okay. 

I'm trying to be okay with being okay. 

I've been trying lots of things lately, and I'm certainly seeing the results of my bravery. I've sobered up. I just got a job that I'm super motivated about, and I think after a few weeks I'll really be able to rock the shit out of it. All in all, I've learned a lot about self-care and self-love in the past month. In the grand scheme, I feel like I might finally be out of the rabbit hole, and can finally get my life moving again. 

But at the same time, I feel alone. I finally accept myself again, which is the most important step. But I feel like no one else wants to share the riches if found within myself. 
I'm a pretty cool guy, I make pretty cool music, and I'm pretty damn funny. 
But I have no one to sing for, and no one to make laugh. And as much as I appreciate my own company, it would be nice to have someone who values me as much as I do. 

That might come off as egotistical, but hey I'm a human being and yeah I have an ego. 

Sometimes I still need someone to take care of me, and I feel like I'm coming up short. 
I could really use a companion right about now. Some one to let me know that it truly is worth it to try to be the best version of myself. 
Someone more than my mom and my mirror.

- If I have nothing to look forward to in the present or the future and there is no afterlife, what am I supposed to work towards?

- Because I see no reason to.

I'm starting to worry that I'm starting to turn out as the 'no good' person my grandpa said that I'll become.

My only consolation is that I'm thrifty and sensible. BUT, my dad spends a lot thanks to his illnesses, cigarettes, lottery and luxurious meals, EVEN THOUGH WE'RE POOR.

"I'm a girl in my mid twenties who has two friends, a job that's steadily decreasing my hours, no car, and no real hobbies. I've struggled between keeping myself entertained, keeping my depression at bay, and balancing my anxiety with my attempts at socialization. But I feel like no matter what I do, I always end up feeling alone. 
I used to be parts of groups, used to make friends in school, used to have things to do outside the house. But now I feel like I'm going through the motions of each day and not taking anything away from them. 
The worst part is feeling alone when I'm surrounded by people. I was out just two days ago and almost immediately wanted to head home. I've always considered myself an extrovert but lately I've found it hard to connect with people. Even in my own home, where I have a few roommates, I feel like nothing I do to interact with them is ever enough. One of them is obsessed with his video games, one is barely ever home, and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that I always feel like I'm bothering her when I try to hang out. And now the icing on the cake is last minute cancelation of our New Years plans (for valid reasons), but then instead of the four of us watching the ball drop together, everyone went to bed early leaving me yet again alone. Now I'm ringing in the New Year crying and writing this down, hoping if I make sense of my crippling loneliness, then there's hope in 2017 I can do something about it.

"I've felt proud of my success in overcoming most of my depression in 2016, and at least making some progress in seeing most people as good. But the end of this year has really taken a toll on me, especially after the election. It's not because of who people voted for, but because of all the horrible things on the Internet that resulted from it! I've always taken comments a little more seriously than most, but why not? If people express what they're really thinking on the Internet, than how can you trust anyone? How many people are friends with another race, then talk s*** about them online? How many people lack empathy for others? How many people condemn others for trying to speak out against hate? How many people really care? 








Despite thinking all this, I've still resolved to being a kind person and trying to understand others, even if their way of thinking is unfathomable to me. But i don't know if i can keep up the faith if this is how people really think. I just want people to be caring, but i know it's not as simple as that. I thought i was getting better, but i just don't trust people anymore.

Sometimes I think of hurting myself, or killing myself. the one thing that stops me is knowing that it would only hurt my family, and my clients. I work a lot and love my jobs (work with special needs individuals) and i will not do that to them. if did not have my jobs and my clients who love me i would do something but i do n0t.

"warning: fairly negative post. 

Feeling lonely &amp; not having friends used to bother me a lot. I thought having people reaching out &amp; caring about me would help me feel better about life. 

   Then I started a program in college where everyone is really ""tight"" with each other. So now I'm not totally isolated like going weeks without talking to people, like it was before. 

   These people are nice, fun &amp; share the same interests as me. There's no reason I couldn't be friends with them. But these relationships don't make me not want to erase my existence anymore, or pull me out of a shell, more confident, cheerful every once in a while, ad nauseum. It's not that they're ""not enough"" or something, it's just that nothing can fix me.

   I guess this past year has really proven that to me. That element of ""I wish ____ would just contact me, it would prove I'm not worthless and someone cares"" is gone, and it's honestly a relief. Kind of like sinking into a somewhat comfortable void. But it definitely scares me for the years to come.

The problem is I've been fighting like hell to keep myself out of depression after losing my grandfather in October. She's been drunk since she got here (she drank a shit ton before we picked her up) and has been saying pretty mean things. I know she's drunk and over emotional right now, but I feel like an idiot for taking on the responsibility of helping her when I'm not even in the right mindset myself. She went on for a half hour about how it was pointless to try to better yourself because youre just going to end up getting old and dying and all I could do was sit there in silence because I literally couldn't come up with anything to counter it.

I've been feeling so darn depressed for the past years and it has gotten so much worse lately. I only eat and sleep, like, all day.I have nightmares every time I try to sleep, and I wake up feeling like shit. I got so much to study and I've fallen behind.  I feel so empty and no matter how much I've tried to give my life some meaning, it all feels so pointless. I'm sick of waking up, I'm sick of breathing, I'm sick of being here. 
I haven't been diagnosed with any kind of mental illness, basically because I avoid talking to people about how I feel. (Can't afford a therapist either). However, I don't know if a diagnosis would matter. Because I kind of feel helpless and I really feel like it doesn't even fucking matter if some prof in a coat tell me ""oh hey something is wrong with your head"". (no shit man) This feels so overwhelming, and dealing with it seems impossible. 
I've talked to some of the people around me, but most of them are the kind of people that like memes about mental Illnesses, so their reactions were like ""Oh I'm depressed too haha"" , or ""You have nightmares? Welcome to the club"", ""you're suicidal? Cool me too!"".

"I've been experiencing depression for around 6-7 years now, and there's a theme I've found in my experience when I'm not in a terrible, suicide attempt-filled rut: I feel as though I settle for everything.  Whether it be my skills as a musician (one of the few things I cherish in life), my relationship status, or my career/educational field.  I currently am not as good of a guitarist as I should be, if I actually put in more work.  I'm very lazy, and almost scared to do it, for fear that I will fail.  I'm settling for my mediocre skills there.  I'm seeing someone, and have been for a little over three months (with a one week break in the middle there), who I don't love.  She's a great friend, but i would admit that since it's my first term, I really did jump at the first chance I had for a relationship.  She's madly in love with me, but I have no feelings for the greater part of the time we've been together.  I'm afraid of being alone.  I'm aware I'm hurting her by doing this, and she doesn't even know it.  So I'm also settling in the relationship realm.  On top of those two, I just started last fall at a college I don't enjoy being at.  Don't get me wrong, the education is amazing, and I got on the deans list for my first term, but I moved from Chicago to this rural area for college and I'm bored out of my fucking mind there.  I go back on Monday, by the way.  Fun stuff.  I'm settling here as well, because I'm getting an education somewhere that I don't necessarily enjoy being at.

All's well and we depart from them around 11 hoping to find something to do as a couple. We end up coming to the conclusion that we have nowhere to be and go home to do what we always do. My husband plays on his xbox and I watch youtube videos. Literally. I've been depressed for years but its little situations like this that get to me. How did I let myself get to this point? I used to have so many friends and so many things to do. But I always just push everyone away and I don't realize it until its too late and too far gone for an apology. I did however start a new job today after not working for the past year and a half after giving birth to my son and staying home to take care of him. I'm hoping things will change. New job, new semester. I just can't help but to cry though. My husband gave me a peck at midnight and he continued on and so did I. He fell asleep around 2am and I ended up leaving and just getting back home 2 hours later. I went for a drive and walked around Wal-Mart. Yeah. Its not our relationship that saddens me or anything about my home life or anything in particular. I feel like everyday gets slightly worse. I want so badly to be a happy person for my husband and my son. I see my husband mirroring my actions and my attitude of disgust toward life and I hate it.

I started getting even more panicky thinking about what happens after life and that if I die is that it?

I have been feeling low for the past couple days and just felt really anxious and upset on the day of NYE. My mood had slightly picked up before we went out but once we were there I just couldn't escape what I was feeling. My girlfriend was naturally really upset and couldn't understand why I wanted to leave. After having a bit of a row I just yelled ""It's because I'm fucking depressed!"" and left by myself. 

I have feelings of guilt - obviously I know she wanted me there but I let this mood I'm having control what I do. It must have looked strange to everyone and I feel like I wasted the night and an opportunity to have fun. Having said that the feeling I had making me want to leave was so overwhelming I wouldn't have enjoyed myself at all.

This scares me - this hasn't happened before, I am usually a sociable person and enjoy having fun with my friends. For the past couple of weeks though I've had this feeling that I just want to stay in bed and do nothing - finally last night I acted on it.

"   2016 was probably one of the most difficult years with my depression and I think a big reason for that is because I let it. I pushed people away,  not because I wanted to be alone, but because it was less exhausting than going out and doing stuff. I waited way to long to go back to my therapist and it just continued to snowball to the point that I felt there was no way out of it.

This step,  being medication,  has been something I've been reluctant to take as I felt like a failure.

So I act, I smile and laugh at their jokes or make lighthearted comments about whatever we are doing, but its an act. The entire time I'm exhausting what little energy I have just to seem normal enough they wont leave me.

But then... they actually think I'm fine. Even though I have told them it's acting. I've broken down on more occasions then i can count now. Begged for someone to help me. Begged for some support, or even just a friendly ear. And they're always nice while I'm crying, they listen to me blither for a while and promise to help.

The next day I'm faking it again cause the guilt of making them feel so bad yesterday is overwhelming. I think they'll remember, that they'll ask and actually care how I'm feeling. I think they may at the very least try to check in on me, or pick up some of the slack around the house. They might offer to drive me to my doctors, or really any gesture of support.

But weeks go by. They act like it never happened, like I never told them how I'm really feeling. So I break down again. Beg for help again. Explain it all again. They think I've actually been fine these past few weeks, even though I had blatantly told them I was acting.

A useless one, at that. I wonder how he puts up with me.

Use and throw away. Stupid. Boring. Unattractive. Terrible in bed. All I'm good for is for getting other people off and not myself. For spoiling others, because I don't want the burden of possessions for when I finally off myself. I had a nice thought earlier. Sell off all my things. Work up a travel fund. Travel to a nice place to disappear and die, probably. Somewhere that hopefully nobody I know has to deal with it.

There's some things up in the air leaving me feeling uncertain, even though I was told they would help me. But I can't help but feel gross, or a burden for asking for financial assistance. I never wanted people to spend money on me. I can't wait until I can go back to living alone, where I don't have to eat. I am so sick of existing.

I don't even really have much of a sex drive anymore. My libido's gone straight through the floor. I still crave being touched, but at the same time I feel like it would instigate a fight if he tried.

You have no idea how hard it was to stave off suicidal thoughts all day. I literally got out of bed at 6:30 so I didn't have to deal with it but I stayed up all night staring at my fucking ceiling. 



It's so much more but I just can't fucking explain it.



It's not even about Lin or anything anymore. It's just the slow climb of every day life realising there's nothing to it anymore. Ive experienced this so many times but each time it's like it'll never end and sometimes it just sticks with me for sometimes a year and sometimes a month then it goes away but it never really leaves. It's impossible to explain even a fraction at this point and I'm so sick of the only time I'm not numbing my brain is just a cacophony of screaming inside my head.



It feels like Everything is a cataclysmic disaster and I just want to get dragged into lava.



At the same time, who really cares anyways? It's meh. So I feel, **meh**. 



And there's no fucking reason, objective reason I should fucking feel this way. And its just a fucking Maelstrom of anger and rage and hatred that makes me want to claw my eyes out.



It's been years, I'm not gonna believe this it gets better shit. There's 7.2 billion people on this earth. Happiness and contentment isn't for everyone, what if 1 billion unfortunate fucks are just supposed to live in this miasma.



For years I've just had to accept this. I don't like talking about and i don't like being aware. I don't want to acknowledge this because I'm already aware it's there and knowing it's there is enough to make me want to claw and rip everything around me to shreds and I'm so fucking close I just want to smash and rip it all away and I'm so sick of this.


It's the ULTIMATE fucking paradox TO EVERYTHING. 


Life, love, people, goals. It's just white noise and it shouldn't be. And it tears me apart.



There's a handful of people that make me really feel alive and happy and even then. It's all just temporary



I sometimes think that I could just be over thinking. Most times it's not even over thinking it, it's I can't even begin to think about it. Where to start or how to. It's frustrating because it's sorta a shadow over who I think I am. Everything feels so entirely fake when I'm alone.

"Hey reddit and happy new year everyone :)
I'm 18 and always had social issues but it's been more than a year that I've been falling down into worse and worse depression. The numerous parties I haven't gone to, the weekends I stayed home by myself, the pressure of finishing high school, the crap of feeling completely alone in the holidays (and on new year's) have led me to a new low.

I wanna focus on another aspect: people I try to talk to have no friggin clue what to tell me. 
My ""friends"" act all supportive until I actually talk to them about my issues. After that, it's like nothing has ever happened and life goes on exactly as usual, with the difference that I feel even more like the ""odd one"" in their eye. I actually have no clue how friends are meant to behave in general, so I might as well assume that's how it always goes and it's my fault for having such ugly problems.

Second, my parents. They think that insisting and trying to convince me to do anything and move my ass, and then getting angry when I either keep saying no or yell at them for what they say, is the way to go. I feel excluded even by them, as if I was a total freak, an alien (barely) walking around the house. 
A few days ago  up even doing the chores they ask me to do and I feel awful for it but I really feel too down to do anything at all.

About consueling, I went to one for a year (15-16 years old) but wasn't much useful since neither I myself had a clear enough idea of what was going on. Sure, he could have helped, but maybe I wasn't receptive enough haha. Anyway, I tried going to another one this September, and uh, it didn't go well at all. I felt like my fucking huge suffering was being minimized as a simple teenager thing. Well, it probably started like that, but apparently I was dumb enough to turn it into a much bigger monster :P

Anyway, I really feel pressured by life that goes on. I feel like I'm being left behind. I need to do something. Now, who should I turn to?",5,"had social issues, no clue how friends  are meant to behave,have ugly problems, feel excluded by parents, counseling didnt help"
"It just blows my mind. 
Are there really people out there that wake up, don't continue to lay in bed, and just start doing things?
I dunno how they do it.
I don't get how someone could enjoy whatever their hobbies are, and enjoy them without ever stopping due to how pointless it is, or how pointless all of life is.
I can't imagine what it's like to have a family that loves you, or to be an important person to anyone else.
Some people can get so much out of life with minimal effort, and all I can really do is lay in bed and cry about how nothing makes me feel good, how I can't enjoy anything, and how incredibly lonely and alien I feel.

"I'm just so tired of feeling depressed all the time, and the stuff i used to have an interest in seems to be boring most of the time.

I've been feeling this for a good amount of years now because of a long story.

Have anyone else any experience with weed, because i've been smoking alot lately and helps me SO MUCH with my anxiety and the ""black and white"" look at the world(please don't tell me to stop, i know the risks)

Why is everything so fucking boring all the time, i feel like i am wasting my entire youth i'm 17, i don't see myself as an isolated nerd or anything i like to produce music on my computer.

I consider myself decent looking depending on the day, i'm not overweight nor skinny.

I'm so sick of being afraid of other people on and off all the time.

I'm a virgin because i'm so scared of girls. but when i am high i can actually speak to girls and make eye contact and just rest in myself, yesterday some girl sat right next to me on an almost empty bus, and when i wanted to go out she smiled to me, and another day i was having a fun time talking with a girl at my friends house(also high at the moment).

When i'm high i feel like i am my true self without a barrier trying to protect me from people.

Some days i am happy and i want to go out and meet people(not very often but sometimes) and other days i am literally scared of everything waiting outside my door

I am speaking with an psychologist at the moment, which is really good for me.

i am taking antidepressiv in a small dose, and i have daily suicide thoughts that i have spoking with my psychologist about.

I have nightmares almost every single night.

I don't know myself, i don't know who i fucking am!

I feel like i am missing out on all the fun

Am i missing out on my youth??

I feel completely lonely in this world even though i have some friends who care about me and i have my mom.

I'm sick and tired of being tired

I think that when people are depressed the see the world as it actually is without filter, if you know what i mean.

I have so much anger inside which sometimes lead to me getting extremely angry because of small things.

I would love to have a girlfriend, and since i'm so bad at speaking with girls, i don't know how the fuck i am going to do that

I would love reply :)

"I've been depressed since I was 18 and I'm 26 today. If I could point at something that's causing my depression, I would say that it's my lack of physical contact with other humans. I feel so lonely, and it keeps getting worse the older I get. Treatment hasn't helped.

So if I were to test, if this is infact what is causing it, how could I go about it? In my dreamworld I would have 30min sessions, a couple of times a week where I snuggle to tv-series with a girl. But of course this is impossible to do. 

What came first the chicken or the egg?

Maybe I'm just thinking too much about my depression, it could be very well be that my depression came first which is why it's impossible for me to find a partner.

"I mean, it was both awful and great

January was the last month where I still had my old values and personality, the same goals and the same outlook. I was just an adoloscent who got through 6 months of not enjoying anything really, ignoring it, getting into a short maniac phase and slowly having it ending. Oh, and I watched the Rebuild of Evangelion movies, they were pretty awesome. 

In February however, I really lost it and fell into a deep, deep hole. I had in the first week of it vacation and for the first time in my life, I felt lonely. Normally, I only felt bored when I was alone. But this time, I really, really wanted to have people around me. And not just friends, I also started from this point on to get interested in girls and scince then, I, uhm, ""search"" (that sounds wrong...) for a girlfriend. This was suprising. 

I was never interested before in romantic relationships. I had only 2 crushes before and with neither did I want to engage in anything, so I never hit a girl. And it's very awkward to get into this when you're around 16, it's interesting, honestly. So much changed inside of me. I didn't feel weird when I got euphoric about the thought of, uhm, cuddling. Also, I learnt that I have no type. Like, if the girl's skin is clean and she's neither super over/underweight, she's fine in my eyes. 

This lead me to get into a girl I already knew since a few months. I already feared that we maybe won't get this along as a relationship. I thought our personalities wouldn't fit very well. However, this changed quickly as I talked with her about politics and she said that ""those filthy niggers and muslims need all to die"". 

This showed me that a personality problem might not be the thing that breaks the camel's back. I mean, I really doubt that a relationship with a racist could work, mostly because many people I get along with are muslims, and a few family members are, and I really am not a big fan of racism, mostly because I am very mixed and brown. 

It really took away my believe in humanity. And I don't mean the one kind people are joking about. I really believed that the world is at doom because of the ignorance and hate of many, many people out there. I didn't give myself and the rest of the world any future. Everything remembered me on the failure that we are. 

And then... I think it was on the second or third of March, I got ill. My blood pressure is normally a bit lower than usual, but around that time, it was so damn low I couldn't stand sometimes. It made me weak and fatigued, unconcentrated and dizzy all the time. I got panic attacks, about once a week. Atleast. And mostly: it gave me the feeling of never, ever, just feeling a tiny bit... like, home. It felt like floating in a weird, alien, dark and cold environment, as far away from everything you feel comfortable with as possible. 

It improved when spring started. I still remember thinking ""I am at constant pain, have no future and basically feel as bad as I could, but the sun is shining atleast.""

However, and that was the big turning point of 2016, I got medication against my low blood pressure. Basically some drops that tasted like rotten tangerines (aka it tasted real bad). They worked after a week or so. I was hitting the gym more often to improve my body situation. It was very effective.

Now, to explain how I felt after this, was kinda like a normal situation with my thoughts being as fast as in a maniac phase. It was damn awesome. I was finally again able to do conservation, I knew what to talk about, how to talk and how to be someone people want to talk with. I was a freaking social butterfly.

I didn't give a shit about what people thought about me, I've seen the worst and I knew that some bad thinking and mean looks about and at me aren't as bad as I always assumed they are. I enjoyed my life. I even got out! I played soccer and was at parties and I was shopping with others... I was never really bored the whole spring over. I mean, I still wanted a girl, but I had friends. And I got close to my coworkers, I think I was one of the more popular guys at my workplace. 

And this is shocking. I also visited in this time my old school and noticed that I really never met many people there and was not popular at all. Back then, I didn't care, but now I felt like I missed some things out when I was just surrounding myself with the people I already know. But now, I knew lots of people and made many laugh. I even got recommended to start stand up comedy once. 

But... It ended way too quick. My mom got between me and my friends. She didn't allow me to see anyone besides people she knew and she didn't wanna know my friends because she was convinced that they were garabage. I mean, she was right, but I am still extremly angry at her for her decision. She killed my social life. 

And she doesn't accept that she did this. She always says now ""I didn't forbid anything"" or ""Don't make others responsible for your problems"" or ""You can still see people we know"" or ""Just search for new friends on Facebook"". Worst part is that my dad who actually would've allowed me this didn't step into this. Like, not at all. And my sister is now always calling me a friendless loser...

But this made clear that I don't want to live with those people for a long time. I think once I find a flat and have enough money, I will instantly move out.

However, that was not the turning point to my worse. The big turning point was this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5fyp8r/what_was_the_biggest_disappointment_of_your_life/dao3vvs/

Friday was btw a birthday at work. The coworkers I invited stayed longer than they should just for the party and they were giving me a ton of alcohol, a few bodybuilding/porn magazines and a book with bad jokes. It was awesome. I really felt like an equal to people who were all far older than me. It was really awesome and if it wasn't for this, I don't think I could've stayed through the weekend. 

I think about maybe doing something with them, even though they are all far older than me, I think I will feel comfortable with this. Too bad that some of them are women and once my parents met them they will talk with me about how I should start a relationship with and marry once I am 18... Man, I mean, I never got hit by my parents. I always got something to eat, drink and to entertain myself, but they are just fucking me up emtionally and I can't even talk with them about this because they will never change. Only scream, play the victim and insult me. There is sure some bias in here, I am in the end not exactly normal with my will for independence and freedom. It's just far bigger than in most others and I feel oppressed really quick, but I really don't feel like it's normal. 

I've never seen other children being treated this way and whenever I talk with others about this, they insist that this is defiently not okay what they are doing. 

But back to topic, not all turned immediatly left. I still felt good mostly, made connections to people and was still deemed as funny and entertaining. Mostly because I am a weird guy and have a weird history with many weird things and people in it. 

It did turn kinda left tho over time. As above said, I had a lot of stress in the family. And I had no friends. And I got slower. By autumn, I was depressed again. However, not nearly as bad as ever before, really. I was and am kinda normal with a lean to a depressive episode, but I learnt how to express my problems to others (even though I never told anyone by now about my mental problems) and how to be still productive. 

And whilst it all got downhill, I am still rather high. I brought just some time ago two people in the same week to cry out of laughter. Or wait, actually, I think it were even 3. I am scared tho of this year. I am scared of going through everything again. And scared of maybe going backwards. But I hope that this year will be more good than bad. Last year was on the other side both the best and the worst year of my life. 

Oh and: I hope the year will be good for you too. ",5,"fell into deep hole, felt very lonely , really wanted to have people around me, no friends in school, mom  prevented me from befriending classmates"
"I feel nothing.

I have been feeling like this for a long time. Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel sad, but for the most part I don't feel anything at all. I think the last time I cried was probably 10 years ago.

Two days ago I was watching Bojack Horseman, and one of the episodes hit me for some reason. It was in season two, when Bojack started crying outside the library. Something clicked with me and I started crying too. I was crying for 10, 20, 30 minutes. I just sat there and cried. In silence, alone. I don't know why, but after I stopped, I was happy. I don't think I've ever been so happy before. Sadly, this whole thing lasted only for a brief moment and before long I was back to the cycle of emptiness.

Since then I've been trying to find something to get me into that state again, but nothing even comes close. Sad songs. Rick and Morty. People talking about their life. Nothing. I just sit there and there is nothing coming out of me at all, like an empty bowl. I don't know if ever I will experience that feeling again. I hope I will.

  Sometimes I like to say 'I like going out to eat' but that's a lie because I try my hardest not to. I've always been the kind of person to just put on a front around other people and laugh and try to say what a normal person would say.

I'm know I should do something but I haven't got the energy and I'm too lazy. I keep telling myself I'm just a lazy shit but then why haven't I done something. When I'm distracted I'm usually fine?!

Like I'm not as bad as others, and half the online tests say I don't have a problem, so I feel like I'm constantly trying to justify to myself that I do have a problem, rather than living my life.

Thoughts?",5,"lazy, sleep cycle fucked up"
"All my life I've had depression, I remember crying myself to sleep for years at about 8/9 years old, I was always an outcast. I cried myself to sleep because I couldn't understand the world, nothing made sense to me, just so confused at how anything worked, one day I'm just not going to exist and I don't think I could imagine living forever so what did I want?

I made friends with girls, losing my best (m) friend to football. I became very alone in primary school. I would walk around with only myself to keep me company. 
There was a 'lunchtime supervisor' I guess you'd call her who noticed I was always alone, I'd wait by this fence for her to come up to me, she always had sweets hahah. We used to walk around together and talk. 

She left and I guess I just always was with girls. People played me, even at that age but it was okay, it wasn't that bad. You know, popularity was a thing even at that age. I had a bestfriend at some point (f) but she was popular and I was wierd. 

Highschool came, I choose to be in her form and another girl's, she kind of hated me at that point but we got closer again. 

I've always been alone.

By yr 9, I made friends with this 'alt girl', Idk what you'd call her, she wash speaking to her older boyfriend, always had arguments with him. We quickly became bestfriends and even though I was depressed it was easily the happiest I'd ever been. 

I started smoking because drugs always fascinated me and it was the closest I could get. We were both pretty popular, I a friend (m) who was popular that I'd play games with over Skype.  Good times.

Yr 10 came and my best friend left me for a girl. It crushed me and I began finding ways to drink, not that it was easy, just a few beers from my mum etc.

I quickly got extremely depressed, I became an easy target now that she was gone and I was confused, I guess I sortof 'followed' them round for a bit which must have made me an easier target.

People would make fun of me, call me gay and stuff because of my young shitty appearance I guess. I did try. I think I still played games over Skype with the guy at this point, which was nice, he was nice.

I switched to vaping to cut costs and for health reasons plus I could simply order stuff online. I vaped heavily as it was my coping mechanism along with self harm.

I remember turning into an empty zombie which was good because it let me cope.  I took caffeine pills everyday to keep me awake which actually improved my grades greatly because I've always been so tired.

By yr 11 things were approaching a sort of neutral line. I hung round with a group that I knew didn't like me but I had always kept a little influence over people. My old bestfriend (f) had stayed my friend atleast, and we were still really good friends just she'd found someone better (aka a girl) to be bestfriends with.

I'm writing this now, in the second year of college, slightly drunk after smoking once again. (I had quit vaping for exams in yr 11). I finally (though it took all of last year) got meds for depression (fluxetine) I'm on my second week of taking it but I starting to realise that a simple pill isn't ever going to help me. I have gender dysphoria, I hate how I look, I can't stand my past and I'm so alone. I have my new bestfriend, let's call her lucy, we became friends walking home together and when thus other group went to town in yr 11. She has helped me so much and she is the only person that I've told about my depression, I've also told her about my gender dysphoria to an extent. 

I'm so alone rn and I realise that this isn't ever going to get better. I will always be a boy and a nobody. I'm not sure I can deal with the fact that I won't ever live the life that I've always dreamt of and I will always be mostly alone. 

I am so glad and happy that I atleast have her. 

It just doesn't feel enough anymore, I always think that ending it is just the best way to go. To be rid of my frustratingly depressing life.

Uni is going to be so hard to try achieve with my ever falling motivation, I'll try and hopefully go the same place as her and her boyfriend. It feels so fucking impossible to do anything, and I don't think anythings ever going to get better, with a pill and some therapy

"Hello everyone,
I am sorry in advance if there is any rule that I should follow when posting this.
Where do I start?

CULTURALLY:
I currently live in Canada but I was born abroad. I have been here for the past eight years and to say the least, the country I am from is very stereotyped... It is located in North Africa so I let you figure out the stigma that surrounds it. I feel alone here. I tried my hardest to make friends but none of them stuck around. I tried to befriend people from different cultures and not just stick with my own (a thing a lot of immigrants do when they move abroad) but I feel like that backfired at me... I am not religious, so my own people do not like me and I am now seen as ""the wannabe white guy"". Other people (mainly natives) get to know me but they never want to do anything with me. Truth be told, I arrived here at 16 so all the groups were formed and all the friends were ""taken"". I try to be nice to people. I try to show them the good side of my culture by inviting them to do stuff and actually paying for them (don't think I am desperate, I do this occasionally when I get a good vibe from the person) but it never works. I do very well at school and according to my brother, people do not like me because they are jealous... I am not sure what to think of that.
I used to have interests but all those disillusions faded them one by one.

EMOTIONALLY:
I have a rather strong personality but no persona. I am the same with everyone regardless of who they are (except my family of course, who I draw limits with). People think I am too straightforward and too blunt. I just do not like to do things that I do not enjoy doing and my ""friends"" get frustrated and mad at me because I do not follow the rest of the people.

MOTIVATION:
I do well at school as I said previously, but my motivation dropped drastically lately. I do the bare minimum. Thank god (or the force) I was gifted with good brains that save my lazy piece of shit ass when needed. I feel like I could do a lot more, but my depression hinders every step that I try to take.

RELATIONSHIPS:
My ex-girlfriend cheated on me, yet I got back with her. She cheated on me with my so-called ""friend"". I got back with her because, on the spot, she apologized and I felt sorry for her because she, herself, underwent severe depression before I came along and saved her. I recently broke up with her because she did not keep any of her promises and also, she is constantly on the move and never really regained my trust ever since I found out she was playing me.

"I try so hard but it seems that the things I long for I may never achieve in this lifetime. It isnât money or status that my heart aches for; itâs a strong sense of purpose. A group of individuals that I could surround myself with and call a âcommunityâ. Itâs a longing for companionship. I spend my days alone, and they are long and empty. I wish I was dead every day. I think about suicide every day. 

I have no one to talk to, because all my friends have slowly turned into acquaintances, and they no longer have room for my ânegative energyâ in their lives. I never asked to be negative. I try so hard to better myself, to get out of my comfort zone, to talk to new people, to exercise, to meditate. I will continue to try to better myself, even for the lack of a result I experience. I will continue to try because itâs all I can do, other than commit suicide and I couldnât bring myself to hurt the few I do have that care for me.

I just wish I had someone that could understand and relate to me, and wasnât afraid of me or keep me at armâs distance. I feel as though I am a damaged person, with depression, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, and deep sadness. Because of this, people find it hard to be around me and to relate to me. Itâs a cycle that causes my pain to deepen.
These past few months have been difficult for me. I try to focus on the good, but itâs really hard. I feel so alone and alienated. I wish I was dead. My boyfriend does not understand. He thinks depression is something more like sadness, like I will be okay if he can make me smile. He means well and is all that keeps me going some days. But unfortunately he lives an hour away, and we work conflicting schedules, so I only see him two days a week. Even so, I think so fondly of him, but I know that deep down he is not doing much to help my emptiness. I donât know if thatâs his responsibility or mine anyways.

I feel existentially lonely, knowing I will never fully experience another person, and they will never experience me. That I will live and die alone. I see people on facebook with friends, making music and art, touring the world, cooking and sleeping with a group of people that love them, and I just long for a life like that. I wish my life wasnât so empty. I have no one to turn to for my bad days, and no one but my boyfriend for the good days.",5,"heart aches for a strong purpouse, a community, days are alone, long and empty,no one to talk to,, wish for someone to understand and relate to me, damaged person , depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder,deep sadness"
Some way or another I got to pull myself out of this pit I'm in I'm probably the lowest I've ever been now and I need to get back up to where I was before I felt like this.

"I feel this might be one of the worst parts for me. I tell people no to hanging out constantly because I can't get out of bed, I work as much overtime as possible to avoid real interaction and I mask it with determination but as soon as friends do something without inviting me I'm heartbroken. I've always suffered from mild depression but I was alright until about 5 years ago bulimia snuck in.

Yesterday I went to a party with close friends and hardly spoke to anyone. To make matters worse, a guy I used to talk to that was flirting with a good friend of mine and now I'm anxious that they think that's why I was upset when really my depression just felt like it was a good time to kick in.

"Over the past year I've lost the majority of my friends. It started off with a health issue that I obviously couldn't prevent, which somehow made me lose most of my friends in high school. I then thought I was alright as I still had a couple of very close friends. I was outgoing, and some other people still seemed to like me. But almost immediately after graduation everyone stopped talking to me. And now in college I still feel so upset and bitter about my high school experience that I don't know how to open up to new people. I'm quiet, introverted, and can't connect with the people I meet. I've met a ton of seemingly great people that right after meeting me escaped becoming my friend. So now I'm lonely in college, my depression is creeping back up after years of carefree happiness, and I've taken to the Internet and video games as my safe place. It's a life that's depressing, but I hope that one day I'll stop feeling so numb and alone. 

One of my closest friends recently just stopped talking to me. We used to play xbox all the time together. Now she hardly answers my texts, giving the simple ""busy"" excuse. I've spent too much time trying to be supportive and loving when other people won't give me a minute of their own time. This is only one example of why I've become only a ghost of my typical self.

I guess, has anyone ever dealt with this? Are you dealing with this now? These types of things only seem to happen to people with depression and other mental illness, which is one of the cruelest things imo.

"Hi guys,

Just needed to vent a little, and maybe ask for advice. I've been in my new job for a little over 5 months and over the last month or so my symptoms have worsened pretty severely. The job is technical fault/support in a call centre for a major tv and internet provider. Initially things were really good, having a routine was really helping and I was making mental improvements. Backstory, I graduated university this year with a graphic design degree and this job is supposed to be a stop gap to save up some money to move to a different city with better job prospects as there are literally 0 design jobs in my city. 

Essentially I'm sick of working crappy shift patterns, having no life outside of work due to travel times and being verbally bullied all day by customers calling up. Kinda came to a head a few days ago when a customer called me useless and told me I was doing a 'piss poor job' - among other swearing and insults - even though his issue wasn't actually anything to do with my role or even my company, really. I know I'm doing a decent job - my manager and stats both say so - but I keep replaying this conversation over and over in my head and I can't shake it. I'm royally fed up of being spoken to like shit over things I cannot control. I'm waking up and I'm nearly in tears before every shift. It feels like this may be the worst I've been in years.

Also, if I decide to leave this job I have to give a months notice, which means I have no idea how I'm supposed to look for something else if I'm unable to start for another month. 

I really have no idea what to do. Anyone got any tips for a situation like this? The company and people are great but the job role itself is severely affecting my mental health and I know I have to put that first but I don't know how to do that.

Something so simple as sending a quick merry Christmas text to my crush is so difficult for me, but this year I found a way to do it.   Getting a response back while I was in the car on my way to seeing relatives I wasnât looking forward to seeing made me smile and feel for a brief moment like Iâm a normal person who could have those things.

"All I hear all the time is that ""I'm lazy"" and that ""I don't care about my family"". I'm honestly not sure so I figured here would be a good place to post and try to possibly see what is going on with me at this current moment.

I've been struggling the past year with getting motivation to do anything. It has just slowly been getting worse and worse. It's to the point where I don't even want to get out of bed most days. Maybe I need an environment change or something? I have no idea.
I also find myself struggling to communicate with people and get peeved over the littlest of things. For example my parents are always telling me to clean but then they pile of bunch of things into my room or my sisters room to ""clean"" out the other rooms. All this does is make me frustrated because my mom later comes in saying my room is a mess and that I'm filthy even though I'm not even the one moving anything because I've been in bed all day.
No matter how much sleep I get I always feel tired and leads me to never want to do anything or have the energy rather to do anything. I do have insomnia and on school nights I would only get about 1-4 hours of sleep depending, but at the current moment on break I'm going to bed around 8am-noon and just sleeping until I absolutely have to get up. Even still I know I'm sleeping way too much but it to me feels like it's just because I don't sleep much during the school year.
During school I typically would only eat 1 meal a day, 2 on occasion, but now it's to the point of me not even wanting to eat full meals. It would be maybe half of a slice of pizza or a bowl of cereal and that would be it + 1 bottle of water for the whole day, then I go right back to sleeping or go on the computer and watch twitch streams.
I am in pain a lot. It's usually either one of my legs or I have headaches, but I'm used to having headaches almost everyday. I also don't like talking about how I feel so I tend to keep to myself, but as of recently I have kind of just been locking myself away in my room and staying on my bed.

I honestly have no idea if I truly could be depressed and should somehow convince my parents to set up an appointment for me or if I'm just lazy. Or if I should just go to the doctor on my own since I'll be 19 this month and could technically drive myself there. I just would have to get the bill sent to my parents so either way they'd find out. The only times I actually feel like doing anything is if I'm able to force myself out of my house. I don't know if it's something that I should actually get checked or if my parents are actually right and I'm just downright lazy. Also, sorry for any grammatical errors I don't feel like reading through it and fixing anything atm lol.

"Hello Reddit depression, I wonder if sometimes anybody else feels like this is the only channel that they have to communicate with other people honestly. I mean Reddit in general not just the sub Reddit depression.  I post a lot on Reddit and I post about a lot of things that are personal to me that concern me and then have a large impact on my feelings. I have been diagnosed with generalized depression and anxiety. I am not suicidal but I feel like lately I am very apathetic about life in general. And while I don't really have a bunch of positive messages to spew Into The Ether I know that there are reasons to continue on. I know that the New Year can bring a lot of Hope to some people but can also bring a lot of dread and negativity to some also. So I'm going to ask you what are some things that you are not looking forward to in the upcoming year? I am not looking forward to continuing to be a very supportive and caring partner to somebody that isn't very good at expressing their appreciation or acknowledgement of it. That is not to say that they are a bad person. It is just that sometimes things get hectic and it is hard to see all of the little thing that somebody does for you to make your life easier. So seriously what are some things that you are worried or anxious about for the upcoming year? What do you hope that you can do better? Or what are you hoping that other people can do for you? Are you hoping for something?",5,looking forward to a very acring and supportive partner in new year

"Had a session with my therapist before the beginning of New Year's Eve. I was trying to explain to her my greatest fear. The fear of never being understood. I was diagnosed with depression in year of 2011. Since then I have sought out treatment in the form of talk therapy and medication. And in all this time, even before I was educated about my ""illness"", not once has anyone I've come into contact with been able to see the world with my eyes. Yet I can be so understanding and kind and caring and able to walk in the shoes of others. I want to make others smile, be happy, and laugh. It's why I'm reading, studying, and practicing to become an actor. But I can no longer hide behind this mask of false images and hopes that ""things will get better"". How is it I can live a solid twenty four years on this planet, down to the exact seconds from which I was born today, being part of a sociable species of animals dubbed humans and still not have a genuine connection with a single person? How? Bar forced seclusion and isolation practices, it should not be possible. I should not be possible. Yet I persist and endure and struggle to live as a thing. A creature. A human not worth the very effort it took to create and make this pathetic existence I call life something worth living. My therapist heard a similar story to what I have just written from me, (minus the whole being alive for a full twenty four years part), and it sounded like she was trying to contemplate an answer to justify my thinking as being a product of my depression. By this time tears were sliding down my face one drop at a time. Yet I felt as stern as an emotionless being. Then she said something that caught me off guard in a voice as sad and as hurt as a mother pleading for the safety of her child. She said, ""please don't hurt yourself"". The thing is, I can't understand if she was crying for me or for what I had just said being reflected off my face. And even if she was starting to cry......., why? Why cry for someone who has no place in society. Why cry for someone who cannot be fathomed by his peers or parents? Why cry at all for this hollow wound of a human she saw before her? Just why?",5,"fear of never being understood,stern as emotionless being,hollow wound "
"I'm glad to have found this page for broken souls. Like most of you, I have no one to talk to either. I certainly have no friends and haven't for a very long time, but I do have a family that loves me and even a wife. But I can't talk to them. See, my family doesn't understand the depths of my depression and I certainly can't explain it. Words fall short, tears choke out the ones I do try. No one knows me. My wife does, better than anyone else, but no one really knows. She's asleep on the couch right now cause we had another fight. 

My depression has been extremely severe for the last year, and the past couple months it has really been spiraling beyond my control. My anger and irritability are off the charts. I can't eat, but I'm starving. I'm so tired, but I can't sleep. I feel like every moment of my life is just spent suffering, waiting and wondering when it will all finally end. I just keep praying I'll die in an accident so I can be at peace without having to feel guilty for hurting the people who love me. I never leave my house anymore, I can't go into grocery stores or gas stations because I can't bare to interact with people. I can't work because the depression is so debilitating. Ive started having panic attacks and extreme social anxiety. I feel like no one likes me and I don't blame them. I hate myself, I hate having this severe depression, I hate what it does to me and the people I care for, I hate that it makes me useless. I would give anything to just be normal. I want to function like a normal person who can shower and go get groceries and talk to people and feel ok and work and contribute something. 

Everyday I wake up, I sit in my house all alone all day long staring at the walls and trapped in my own head, then I try to sleep again. I don't want to even move. It's gotten so bad and I'm so afraid of finally killing myself that I went to the doctor a few weeks ago even though I have no money, job or insurance. They did an MRI of my brain with and without contrast on the 28th and I am waiting for the results. I feel that I must have a brain tumor or something. I'm scared of how I feel and I am losing more control everyday. 

I'm almost 28 years old, I have 2 college degrees, a loving wife, a house, food, family...I had a good life for the most part, I mean it could have been a lot worse and honestly, situationally my life is better than it's ever been before. That's why I don't understand why my depression has gotten so bad right now. I've been depressed officially since I was 17 but the first time I tried to kill myself I was in the third grade. I don't want to kill myself anymore, although I fantasize about dying constantly. I'm not selfish enough. That's why I really want some help, I've lost control several times recently and all it takes is a few seconds to end your whole life. I don't want to do that. But no one understands where I am at right now, not even my wife and we have been pushing each other away for months.

I recently tried to battle my loneliness and for several months I tried making new friends and reaching out to old ones that I had lost. I kept it up daily even though it was exhausting for me. I never even once got the slightest indication any one of them cared or wanted to be friends or even liked me at all. It sucked and it hurt and it made me retreat farther. I used to be popular in high school and have tons of friends, I dont know what is so unlike able about me now. I guess I am awkward and don't have much in common with most people.


So.....what am I supposed to do? I just want to be better.

Thanks to the shitty global economy, and cultural shifts, people are delaying having kids later and later. Basically waiting until the last possible moment before infertility. It's well known there's a link between autism and the parent's age.

I am Jack's complete lack of surprise when a family member updates me last week on a couple that had a kid in their 40s and the kid is now a few years old and having... delayed milestones.

Then you see shit on TV like celebrities having kids at almost 50 and acting like it's the new normal and a good idea. Again, total madness.

Not to mention the environmental factors, including the country's increasingly crumbling infrastructure (one word: Flint). Nothing but bad news everywhere...

"So i'm meant to make an oral presentation in the next 4 days... easy right? well i don't want to do it everytime i goto do it i lose all motivation and try to avoid it.


Sometimes i'm asking myself is it even worth it... i mean what will it add to my life...nothing it only makes me a more valuable asset to society a cog in a machine.
I do my best so everyone is happy my feelings or desires are irrelevant.
Society has no place for the weak or unwilling unless you are prepared to be a slave to society and work so you can live you will die.
So i'm studying for what..?
The ability to wake up goto work get home spend 4 hours at most playing games and socializing then goto sleep and repeat?
The accumulation of stress and dissatisfaction renders that a logical life.. it would be irrational to put yourself in that state knowing you are literally digging your own grave.

Yet if you don't do it you die either way ...i'm not strong like most i can't handle as much as others in this society no every society the weak is left to die or used as tools to serve the strong till they die.


I don't want that i don't want to spend my life working a 9-5 job just to get home and distract myself for a few hours before i goto sleep and repeat.
I keep running simulations in my head and the only outcome of that is me snapping and doing something drastic eventually.
one must work to earn their keep and survive but.... we don't have a choice really.

Is it our choice if we live and work to live? No it isn't because if we choose otherwise we are treated with scorn and brainwashed into thinking we are ill or are the problem. we don't really make choices we just do what we are told like slaves.
I'm meant to be comfortable and just accept that though because that's what society is?
I don't want to die...but living like everyone else does that's a fate worse then death to me personally.
I don't want to be given things on a silver platter i want to work but these shackles and the lack of choice that people take for granted are so visible to me.
Truth is we can't do whatever we want even if we are told we can we are just sheep that follow what we are told.
Call this a existential crisis but this society and way of life is malformed...we are gears of a working machine and nothing more.

We drink and eat party and play games and chat with our friends to cheer us up to make us ignore reality i don't want any of that..
I want my freedom to make my own choices and not be bound to the will of others.
I'm considering dropping out of my university course ... i don't want to be like my parents or their parents or the rest i don't want to follow that same path.

Surely i can find a different one right?

"I'm 20, and a sophomore in college. I struggled with depression in high school, but thought I got over it for the most part. When I'm at college and surrounded by friends, I feel great. But the second I am alone in my dorm, I feel like shit. 

And now that I'm on winter break, that feeling is magnified. I don't know if it's anxiety or depression or a mix of both, but I just feel like trash and I don't want to exist (no worries though; I'd be posting this on r/suicidewatch if i thought I was actually considering acting on that feeling.) I am sad. I don't have friends at home really, and I guess this has me all wondering, am I just predisposed to being sad? Like if I'm only happy when I'm busy and with other people, then is my natural state of being just being a pile of shit? 

And does anyone else ever feel this way? I'm good as long as I'm distracted I guess. But when I'm on break, all I do is lay in bed and fuck around with the computer or video games. I have nothing to do or think about, so the things I end up thinking about are all negative. I don't hate myself or anything; I'm just sad and don't really wanna be (be as in exist, not as in ""don't wanna be sad,"" i now see how the syntax there mighta been confusing) (though ideally i wouldn't be sad either) (lastly feel like i gotta say it one more time: seriously am not gonna kill myself. Feel like I gotta make a disclaimer on that).",5,"dont have friends at home, only happy when I'm busy, really sad, dont wanna exist"
"My car needs a new steering pump.

Not really sure exactly what this is going to entail or what the goal here is, but I'm just going to explain my situation because I feel like telling someone will help me in the short term while things happen.

I'm a 25 year old male living in Vancouver, Canada. I'm basically a hikikomori if you know what that is, though not as bad these days. Roman Catholic mom(fairly devout), agnostic dad. 7 child family. Went to a catholic private school grades 1-7(and about half of 8 or so{I believe because of money}). I've always been fairly shy and introverted. I've had depression since I was about 13-14. It feels like manic depression, I can't be sure though because I've never seen anyone about it. Suicidal feelings from around 15-now. (not as bad now, but still scary sometimes)

I had lived in a fairly small town from when I was 6 to about 12, when my family had to move due to my dad being laid off. We never had much money. I'd had some decent friends and a pretty normal life there. I was happy. I went to 4 seperate schools(including a small stint of home schooling) immediately after this through grades 8-9 due to moving around, and ended up going into a pretty good public high school near me. 

Due to my introverted tendencies, the constant changing social environment, and making some progress with relationships that were cut off when I had to move again I think I just stopped wanting to make relationships with people.

I stayed at that school from 9-12, didn't have any serious issues. Never made any real friends. People tended to like me if they talked to me at school, but I wouldn't want to deal with most of them outside of it at all. We only had 1 computer in the house at this point, and I spent as much time on it as I was allowed. Through my mom's love of lord of the rings and her discovery of irc and nerd chat rooms, I eventually came to play a game called guild wars, which is amazing and you should play it. Not 2 though.

Anyways, while playing this game I met a guy and eventually bonded with him over just general internet things and general philosophy kind of stuff. We became pretty good internet friends and he was my only real friend I felt I had from something like 15-19. He proceeds to get girlfriend and as a result he finds he wants to spend most of his time working on his life in their relationship. I grow sort of bitter towards him since then. We still talk but it's just bullshit and it makes me hate myself and him for not being honest I guess. bromances are hard.

I lived with my family up until july 2016, when I moved into a top floor rental suite with a brother and sister. They're both constantly going out/bringing people over and it's annoying for many reasons. I had to use my credit card to pay for rent for the first few months, and have a bit of debt as a result. I've never been good with job stress and just holding a job for long periods, but I'm currently working at a sorting/shipping warehouse. It's not bad but it doesn't pay all that much and it's been stressful lately, I've been considering just walking out and hoping to god welfare will accept me if I see a counsellor or something. I have a small amount of money saved that could almost pay off the debt and leave me with nothing if I use the tax return from this year, maybe. 

I've had other friendships and relationships of various levels of seriousness, all mostly around not serious and just bullshit, in the time since. Not really in the last few years because of what ends up happening with them though. Whenever it ends up becoming somewhat serious which usually ends up happening, someone(often myself) can't handle it and has to go.

Over time I've just become less and less interested in having any sort of relationship with people. They're all shit when you get down to it(I know this isn't really how it is, but it's how it feels, socially). I hate people. 

The resulting state of my mind is not good. I'm terrible lonely and constantly think of how it might feel to actually have someone that I could love. Every day I constantly feel like I should just kill myself as it doesn't really matter in the big picture, but I feel to guilty because i'd hurt too many people. So every day I'll say I wish I could kill myself today but I can't. I have nieces and nephews and a mom that would be devastated. I'm lucky to have a single person that I actually also met on guild wars, that I can still talk to seriously and consider a friend even though I'm not sure how close. I might be dead without him. 

It's just that in this new house, without my parents. Without that 1 close friend I'd had on the internet in high school. Without any meaningful relationship with a girl ever other than 1 or 2 botched online ones, I'm so fucking lonely.

Every day it gets more unbearably lonely. I've smoked pot since graduation, walking to a grad party some ""friends"" had some alcohol/pot, and had always been sort of pressuring me and I'd been turning them down. I decided it was grad party time and fuck it, I'd wanted to try drugs for a long time anyways. Pot is amazing and has helped me a lot, but relying on it in times when your depression gets this bad and you need to constantly smoke more and more, it starts to just make you feel worse after a while if you don't do anything else/figure something out. I'm cutting back and trying to do something about it but when you've been on the internet this long and hate people this much etc there's not much I want to do except have someone that I love and who loves me. Which I will never have because that person can't possibly exist, and I wouldn't meet them if they did, and they don't deserve to have this broken piece of shit tied to them if they did. 

What I hope for is that I'll end up leaving this job, getting on welfare, rent my own place somewhere cheap and start drawing/painting doing other stuff I've wanted to do. Open up to people and find a girl that I could be serious with forever. One day support myself off of something that I like doing. 

I don't really know what I need to be happy, I just know that I'm definitely not right now. I know that it would definitely help to have a relationship. I can't go out seeking one in the state that I'm in right now though. I'll continue going on not killing myself. And being paranoid and hoping that things will eventually get better and the balance will tip. I don't know. :(

There's a lot more that I've left out because I don't want this to legit be my life story.

TL;DR: basically my life story. 

ask me stuff I might answer

my name: I've seen ""man wipes"" where I work, and they're the first funny thing to came to mind when every other throwaway account name I thought of is used. It made me happy for a second.

if you're a cute girl that wants to talk/thinks they might like me/is in the same boat or whatever, send me a pm. I don't know if I'll answer, right now probably not. but I hope maybe I will? Let's make a new character and play guild wars please. Ignore my confidence issues.

"I'm on a mobile and first time posting, long time lurker. 

So for that past two years I think I've been depressed, I've had to deal with a lot of losses. 
I thought and truly believed I was just 'tired' someone mentioned that I have zero motivation and zero interest in anything any more. 
I used to be the type that would rant and rave about the latest book, I couldn't tell you the last time I had an interest in a book. 

I work full time, come home and go to bed. I don't eat, I barley have a conversation with my family anymore and have 1 friend who I see once or twice a month. Other then that I lay in bed, in the dark and cry. 

I'm ready to get help, I don't want another year to pass me by, I want my old self back. 

Can anyone help with how I can speak to my doctor  to about this, how do I open up? I've never actually said these things out loud as I have no one to speak to 

Thank you in advance for any help I can get! ",5,"zero interest and zero motivation, work full time, barely have conversation with family, lie in bed in dark and cry"

I feel like I am so far behind and get caught up in the past. I need to be someone better, and I need to stop sulking. I feel that every time I try to get better, someone does something petty to set me off, and because of this, I have fallen  into avoiding people. I don't want to be this person, and I'm so scared that I'm falling into a slump that I won't be able to pick myself out of.

"So I have been in depression for almost more than 2 years now. At the start of the those 2 years, I quit my job and literally spent 2 years sitting at home. 

Now I want to get back to life. However there is a constant thinking in my head that I am a loser. and that I have not achieved anything in life. which makes me wonder what should I do now. 

All I see is the darkness. I have started to believe that I need to get out of depression first before thinking anything about the career. Is that approach okay ???. If yes then can someone please guide me how to move forward ? 
I have already expressed myself on this subreddit the past week and the replies i got were encouraging. However I now think that there is a phase or gap between the mind filled with depressive thoughts and the optimistic mind looking for something for the career. I am 27 and will be 28 in 7 months and I want to transition from the former to the latter as soon as possible. can someone help me with that ?

"I wanted to hear some opinions on a decision that has been bothering me for the past few months. No one I've asked irl seems to want to tell me what they actually think, just telling me to decide on my own.

I'm a sophomore at university, and I've been severely depressed for about two years now. Over the last year, my depression has gotten worse and worse. This last month of school, I didn't go one morning without crying, I constantly just wanted to go home. For whatever reason, being at school, being at my apartment in my university town, is miserable for me. 

My counselor suggested that if I wanted, I could take this spring semester off with medical leave. 

I don't want to stop school. I know it wouldn't be a ""failure"" to take a medical break, but it sure feels like it. I can't even imagine a future in which I don't go back to school. I don't know what I would do with myself at home. Lounge around in my tiny town and work retail? I don't know if that would help me at all. 

On the other hand, this December was easily the worst month of my life. The last two weeks of school I had to fight every day to get up in the morning; just walking across campus without wanting to break down and cry was a struggle. I know university has become this negative space for me, and I guess it would make sense that I get away.

I don't want to leave school, despite all of this. School is the only thing I really have. I don't have any activities or friends. I go to school, go to the gym, do homework, and sleep. Once school is taken away from me, I will have nothing. Maybe it is a blank slate that I need? But maybe once this is taken away I truly will cease to be a functioning member of society. 

I'm scared that if I leave school, I won't find my momentum again, and I won't ever go back. But if I go back and it's anything like this December, I won't make it. 

I really don't know what to do.

"If you dont believe in Karma, you will after this story. This is a story of my year of how I lost everything that makes me happy. I have never been good around people... I mean awkward around others. I hate being this way, but society will not let me change. I try to but I always end up here... ALONE. I had it all until Jan. 2016. So like I implied before, I never had many friends in reality but I did online. I played Xbox a lot (too much) but it was where I was happy. I had an adequate amount of friends there, but I had taken it all for granted. I treated my friends on Xbox like shit. They were the best friends I had but pride consumed me. On one bad day, I had been informed we do not have unlimited internet anymore.This was devistating because the happiest moments of my life was here. This was in January when this had happened. I managed the best I could. This hurts me the worst because this ruined my dreams of being a gamer on Youtube. We still had internet but limited.
      So the month is now March, I have met a very beautiful girl, and I wanted to ask her out but I didn't want to rush anything ( This was an excuse because I was scared). I tried to gain the courage to ask her out everyday. So lets skip to next month (April), I finally gained the courage and did it. The answer was maybe. I should have just given up there, But I was in denial. She manipulated me for a month until she said no. Life was living hell for awhile.
     So after I tried to get my life together, the month is now June. I was now going to pursue my Youtube dreams. I was blindly happy for awhile. I told myself me videos were good... looking back I lied to myself. With limited data means limited quality. The only subs I got was my friends. After about a month of regular posting, my videos got a little better. I was somewhat happy until I lost all of my friends on Xbox. I know I am the only geek who had best friends on Xbox but they were. I don't blame them. I treated them like shit.  After this I just lost all hope and care. I posted about 2 more videos then I lost all my motivation. I was truly ALONE.
     After this I started to learn more about programming. I love computers. The more I learned about programing, hacking, etc. the more alone I felt. Around this time school started so I couldnt program as much. I absolutely hate school. They say High School is the best years of your life, but I say Bullshit.
     So time passed and the time is December 2016. I still played games but not as much. They are the only thing that made me happy. I see it as alcoholics have boose and I have games. I was so alone that I played cs:go in offline mode. Cs:go took up too much data so I didnt want to play online. I felt invincible online at times when I was programming. One dark day my pc gets hacked. I lost over a years worth of code. Ironically at this time I was making a very strong firewall that was almost finished. The hackers stole the code for my firewall program. I had to get a new OS         (operating system). I lost my games too. I cant get them back either. I am left with nothing.
      This is the conclusion of this story. I am not going to commit suicide. I do feel numb and emotionless. I smile and laugh sometimes but it is just a mask of numbness. This is my story of 2016 and how all this contributed to my depression. I do have few friends outside in reality but I had really good friends online too. I am lost in life now. I do not have dreams anymore. I do not know what to do. I wrote this because I have been keeping this bottled up for the whole year. I take full responsibility for my actions and I think I deserve what has happened to me. Hell I treated my friends in reality like shit too.  I thank you for reading this.

"I don't know how much more I can take. I've been depressed for years, tried half a dozen kinds of medication, been in therapy for 6 months (tried multiple therapists) but it just doesn't work. Every time I think I'm making progress, I'm quickly reminded I'm wrong. 


I have no friends. Not real ones. I can't remember the last time one of them initiated contact with me, not on a normal friendship level. I'm everyone's sounding board. I listen to their problems, I offer sympathy and advice, and they go on their way. I have nobody to talk to about my problems because they've all go their own stuff. They wouldn't care anyway. I always have to make the effort and then get nothing back in return. My boyfriend says his friend like me, but that's only because I'm dating their friend. 


I know nobody 'deserves'  friends, but I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I try so hard. I put in so much effort to be there for everyone whenever they need. I try to be fun and engaging and talk to people about their interests even though they never show an interest in mine. For example, I won a pretty big prize related to my hobby last month. Everyone knew about it, nobody cared. If my friend won an award, even in something I don't care about, I'd at least be happy for them and congratulate them. But no, nobody even pretended to care. 


I keep thinking if only I was more attractive, people would like me more. Attractive people have friends, right? If only I was smarter. I know I'm smart, but maybe that's not enough? Am I not funny enough? I travel a lot but make a conscious effort not to be obnoxious or pretentious about it. I don't post 200 selfies from my trips or anything like that. My hobby is slightly unique, but still something anyone should be able to relate to. I'm up for anything, I'm adventurous, I always put on a happy face. I just don't understand why my friends keep rejecting me. Whenever I try to make plans someone comes up with an excuse to bail. 


I've tried making new friends. I moved to a completely new city a couple of years ago to try and start fresh, but the cycle continues. 


A few years ago I was supposed to be my best friend's bridesmaid in her wedding. She demoted me from bridesmaid without telling me (I had to find out through Facebook) and then I wasn't even invited to the wedding. And I still don't know why. I've thought about it so many times and I can't think of a single reason for that to happen. She's still 'friendly' with me, so no, there was no fight we had, not even a mild disagreement. Literally nothing I can think of that would have caused that. 


Then a few weeks ago an out of town friend guilted me into letting her crash at my place even though my apartment is way too small and it would be a massive inconvenience. It was super short notice but I felt bad for her so said yes. She never responded to my reply, never showed up, haven't heard from her since. 


I wish I was just being intentionally obtuse but I... Just don't know why I drive everyone away. I wish I knew what I was doing wrong so I could fix it. 


It doesn't help that my mother has replaced me with my nephew. I understand she's excited about being a new grandma (15 months) and I love my nephew so much, but literally every single photo of me has been removed from her house and replaced with my nephew and sister. Not an exaggeration, all of them, even my baby photos. 
Again, I don't know why. My mum and I have a good relationship, hell we're away on holidays together right now! 


I'm at the end of my rope. I don't know what more I can offer people. I don't need a best friend, I just want someone to like me. I'm very lucky to have my boyfriend, he's great, but it's unfair to place all my emotional needs on him. I just want a friend. But it's like I'm not meant to have one. 


I'm so unhappy and don't know what to do. I want to know what I'm doing wrong because I can't keep living like this. I'm on holidays so I should be happy but I can't stop crying in the bathroom.

"Hey everyone. Still horribly depressed here. Lately I've been lurking subreddits and searching the internet on ways to improve my situation (something I spend a lot of my time doing, likely to the point of counterproductivity), and I can't help but feel terrible after doing so. 
        
My main problems are things many of you are also probably familiar with; i'm depressed, have a rock-bottom self esteem, have suicidal thoughts, ect. The issue I have that trumps (and is likely the cause of) all the others is that I'm socially awkward and suffer from social anxiety. 

I have terrible social and emotional issues. Honestly, this makes me feel like I generally suck as a person, and mixed with depression, is objectively true.  Worst part is, I'm 21, an age where the vast majority of people have either already toppled these kind of issues in adolescence or were successful enough in being people that they never experienced them. But me? I'm fucking lost. Well, not lost necessarily, but hopeless? I know what I need to do to become confident, stable, likable, successful in my endeavors. Problem is, when I see how much work I have to put in to actually become a decent person, realize the sheer gravity of the change that has to take place for me to be the person I want to be and the literal year(s) it might take, I start to wonder if it's really worth it. 

I have no friends. Let me go a step further and say I have no real human connections.  This is not because of other people. It is because of me. Who I am fundamentally as a person, the result of my life and culmination of my personal reactions to my life's events. I have never been confident and social, and thus have never known what it's like to truly live. Twenty one years of never truly living is twenty one years wasted, and I don't know if I can go on. There are so, so many things about me that need fixing. I have to work relentlessly to reverse the damaged/incongruent person I've become. The thing is, most people don't have to worry about any of this shit. Even a lot of depressed people have friends, significant others, and get over their ailment with relative ease. Me? I can't even fucking have a conversation with someone. I don't know if I'll ever be the person I want to be, or grow to love the person I already am; It would take too much time and effort to do either. I'd rather just end my life now and save myself the pain.",5,"horribly depressed, looking internet to improve  situation, terrible social and emotional issues, have no friends, no real human connections"
"I got a guitar for myself this Christmas. My family kind of ignored me this year for Christmas, but that's par for the course....Either ignore or belittle me, one or the other. Anyways. I started playing again. It was a random idea, honestly, a 'good day', where I passed the local music store and saw one in the window. I'm broke, to be honest, but I figured I'd stop in and talk to them to see if they had any cheapies. 

What do you know, my old music teacher was in there talking with them. I haven't seen him in four years, and back then I was okay. Fuck, I was more than okay. I was a greek god for all I was concerned. He actually didn't recognize me, not that I don't blame him. I've gained a bit of weight and I have a bad habit of not taking care of my hair..After talking to him for a little while, and explaining the new idea, he said that he was actually here to sell his guitar. He said if I wanted it, it was mine, so long as I promised to play it pretty often. It's not new or a beauty, but it meant a lot, especially since I look like unmotivated scum.

Anyways. There's my hope for the day. I've been playing that.

I'm always set few clocks to have 100% chance of woke up. After 3 clocks I turn every single one off. I don't wanna get up. I wanna just lie in my bed for all day but after few minutes i get up. I feel extremely stressed and bad. I don't have any tests today and anything that could stress me so what the hell? Why am I feeling this way?

When i'm in school nothing bad I think that would happen happened but I still feel bad. Even through ppl talk to me, nothing bad happen I feel worse and worse. Then I have suicide thoughts. Realy big. Actually I may do this, there are so big if they haven't ended after some time. They and bad mood ended when I have nice conversation with friend about makeing cover of Sepultura song. I suddenly stop feel bad and feel happy for few minutes. The thoughts ended but after I came back to my house, when I'm alone I feel bad again. What the hell is happening to me?

"Hi folks, it's my first time in this sub. This is my main account, though i am not a very active commenter, i ussualy lurk reddit everyday. I guess i should be making this posts in a trowaway, but i think i'll end up forgetting this one, so i prefer to use my main and i think i'll better be plain and transparent in this but not getting also too much into detail in the public thread, so i'll start introducing myself. My name is Victor, i'm from Spain and 30 y/o. The last 5-6 years for me have been utter downhill. I feel i lost everything i cared for in my life. My house, my relationship, jobs, friends... sometimes i think i am kind of a reverse King Midas, in the sense everything i touch becomes shit (again, not giving many details on public just in case, if you're interested just pm). I would really like to turn this situation around, i'd like to fix all the things that are wrong with me (and i am already working on this but its not going to be fast), and i would like to talk to people without being all gloomy or have to fake smiles. In the beginning i was capable of that, telling some jokes, faking smiles, making everyone think i was allright and break crying when i was at home alone, but recently since i moved back to my parent's this has become harder and harder. They are great, and my brothers too, but i really can't put more weight on their shoulders. Sometimes i feel like i only need someone who i can talk to, trust, be a little understood or share my feelings without being judged or told things like the usual ""you'll get better, yay!"" kind of thing.
I do freelance work from home, not earning much and not having many opportunities to meet people or pay for professional help, and i don't really know how to start getting out of this situation. The best thing i could come up was this post so you can figure out how lost i am in that sense.
Any recommendations on how can i approach meeting new people and possibly get all the things off my chest in order to regain some confidence in myself and hopefully be back on track?

**TL; DR:** 30 y/o, life fucked up, no friends, need to talk to someone but can't figure who, how or where to begin.

"I'm so confused and fucking afraid. I've always been lonely,  but I accepted it as a kid. That no matter how hard you try, there are just some people who will always be the black sheep. I was fine with it, even though I didn't like it.

But now, I really want to end it. You don't understand, I have this need to run something sharp across my throat, to set myself alight... I feared death to the point where I was scared of going to sleep because maybe I wouldn't wake up.

"I'm 6'4"", 36 years old, and have the typical dad bod physique, so it's been as long time since I've taken a bath.  It's just not practical in the least. As I type, I've got maybe a third of my body actually submerged, and that's just how it goes for large people in a typical tub. 

Anyway, that's not at all the point of my post, I just wanted to give some frame of reference for my state of mind. Today I've reached a new low, I feel utterly hopeless, sad, and lonely. So much so that some primal urge to crawl back into the womb prompted me to draw a bath in an attempt to find some basic comfort. 

I'm married and have a 6 year old daughter; my daughter just knows that mom and dad fight a lot, which is bad enough, so I'm trying to spare her in any way I can manage. It's impossible not to let depression impact a close family relationship, even when it's the single most important relationship in your whole life.  My wife has struggled with depression herself, but she's little help in this situation, and often only serves to make it worse. 

As I sit here in the tub, mostly exposed to the cold air, partially submerged in rapidly cooling water, I'm trying to figure out how I even got here. Did I really make such poor decisions in my life? Is everything that has brought me to this state entirely my fault? And that's when it hit me; the ultimate analogy for life as it applies to my current situation: Life is a journey. This is not a new metaphor for life, and all of what just occurred to me has likely occurred to many others, but it was an important revelation that I at least wanted to share. 

Life is a journey, we all have to make choices that determine where we'll end up; our ultimate destination. I have always known that I've made poor decisions in my life that have put me on a more difficult path, but I've also had circumstances outside of my control that have also had significant impact. Some people are fortunate enough to have support and guidance in their journey, from people who have done well or been lucky in their life choices. That's wonderful, I envy that tremendously. 

For those of us who didn't have that benefit, it means flying blind a lot of the time. Imagine that you are driving somewhere really far off that you've never been to before and all you've got is a super vague map with most of the route completely missing. Sure everyone's life is like that to a degree, but some people have those they can ask for directions, people who are invested in their successful journey. A lot of us don't have that, so every turn is a roll of the dice. Some get it right, some get it wrong, some find immediate disaster. 

I feel like the last fifteen years or more, aside from having my daughter, almost every single decision has made my journey more and more difficult, and taken me further from where I want to be. I feel like a refugee in my own life.

In the analogy of life being a journey, there is no going back and making course corrections. I can't go back to the intersection of Work and College and make a different choice despite the circumstances, I can only try to keep going towards my destination and hope to find that intersection again. You can only move forward, there is no going back, so it's easy to just get completely and utterly lost. 

Now, as I've said, I know I'm here because of my own poor decisions, but is it fair that I be stuck here indefinitely? I don't have people I can ask for help. I don't have resources to pay somebody to care about my well-being.

I am in the middle of a place I don't want to be, scared to death, and have no idea how I'm going to get out of here.",5,"depressed, want comfort, married  , 6 year old daughter, wife struggling with depression too, want someone to take care and talk to"
"Hi everyone.  
This is a throw away.  
I don't know if I have the right to say I'm depressed because I mostly think that I'm making it up in my head.  
There are some times when I'm fine but then I get really sad moment every 2 weeks and every 2 or 3 months everything becomes really dark and I just stay in bed for days. Sometimes I think of killing myself a lot, I really dream of doing it, sometimes I plan it, but I never did anything close to it. Just self harm or eating to the point where it hurts, sex addiction, drinking, smoking.  
I never was in a relationship, no man ever said they loved me until I was 26 years old. I had given up on it by then and I had decided to write all my goodbye letters and go on a trip to NZ and die there.  
But then I met a guy I really liked spending time with, and he told me he loved me, I couldn't believe it but after a while I felt it too, or let myself feel it too, and we've been dating since. After that for the first time in 10 years I felt quite good and took up new hobbies and was seeing a future for myself. All this time I still felt that there's something wrong with him for loving me, but I was able to enjoy it while it lasted.  
We're still together now, but I want to leave him. He didn't do anything wrong and he is still great but I feel like I'm a weight and just the worst person to have feelings for. I don't understand his love. He is blinded by I don't know what. What can I add to his life? Absolutely nothing. Just negative things. I want to sabotage this whole thing or ghost him.  
I'm really lost because in the past I have been able to see what I was unsatisfied by in our relationship, he has also brought up some things I was doing badly and all these things have been talked through and worked on and corrected. But now I just want to be alone and stop suffering, the fact that I'm weighing him down is just another thing making me sad. I want to be cold to him so that he finally leaves.  
He is trying to be supportive but I don't want to ask for his help anymore. When his presence doesn't help, both of us just feel worse. And I don't think another person can fix/heal me so it's pointless.  
  
Sorry for this long rant. I guess I was just hoping to see if anyone has ever felt this before?  
  
Tl;dr: For the longest time I was convinced that I was unlovable (and still am despite his love), but now it turns out I am unable to love as well. Does this ever get better?

"I don't even *know* what to say, I'm only posting here because I don't have anyone in real life to talk about these feelings with. Well, other than my girlfriend who can only say so much to help. She's a good sport about it at least and never complains about me complaining. 

I just feel very hopeless. I'm 23 and haven't accomplished too much yet in life. I dropped out of college a few years ago and honestly have no desire to go back. That's the thing, I have no desire to do anything. I don't get it. I take the medicine, I talk to my therapist weekly and learn ways to manage negative thoughts but it all feels very bogus to me. I see no point in doing anything that doesn't offer an instant reward. I see people around me who are so passionate about so many things in life but I've never been genuinely passionate about anything, at least not for very long. My interests come and go. I hear of people getting over their depression but I have a hard time believing that I'm going to just **get over** what I feel is a huge part of who I am. I have memories as far back as age 5 and even before and I always remember being nervous and anxious and having this feeling of constant impending doom. I know this sounds negative but I genuinely think I was just born with a brain with faulty code. I like computers and know that sometimes things just go wrong and you have to hit the reset button, but I can't reset my brain. I don't even know where this is going or why I'm even posting.

"I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience, and how they handled it.
I an 32 years old and I have a mix of anxiety and depression, and often find I am really only feeling ""ok"" when I am at work of asleep, especially in the winter.  This winter I have been really lonely, having pushed away/ been pushed away by most of my friends (getting older is a bitch.  I used to be a popular guy, now I'm pretty isolated and lonely).
So, lately, I have been working pretty hard, and then when I get home I just want to put on the TV and go to bed, even at 5 or 6 PM.  Part of the problem is I will wake up after like 4-6 hours, even if I am still tired, even if it is just midnight.  The even bigger problem is that I have been having all these weird, self-injurious thoughts.  When I have them, I am really horrified and feel a tremendous amount of anxiety about it.  When I am falling asleep, I will *JOLT* awake, and this will happen over and over.  I also have weird thoughts that I might jump out of my window or do something self-injurious while I am asleep, which terrifies me.  I know this is all sort of irrational. Unlike some other people on here who contemplate suicide, I never do that.  It's more like an OCD fear that pops into my head that I might lose control impulsively, or something might happen while I'm asleep.  Sometimes I'm using scissors or a knife and I will have the same weird fear wash over me, and I literally have to put down whatever I am doing and walk away from it.  I don't trust myself.  Is that weird?
Recently, the thoughts are really escalating to a point where I am sometimes really unable to go to sleep for a long time.  Sometimes I will start drinking, just to sedate myself to chill out for bed.  Any idea what may be going on?

"SORRY....BUT IT IS!!!

Obviously, if you are so depressed to the point where you have such a low mood that you don't eat, sleep, shower, socialize etc - and you do this for weeks/months/years - then it stands to reason that this is certainly an abnormal way of thinking and you should seek help.

BUT......nobody ever discusses the opposite - people who are so peppy and happy ALL THE TIME to the point where it's obnoxious. I know (and knew) some of these people and it makes me sick. What make sme even more frustrated is that this isn't acknowledge as a mental issue, but it certainly should be!

When we are first born, we are crying. It is a human instinct to cry or feel fearful when we are endangered, just like it's a natural instinct to smile or laugh when we are pleased. 

But what pisses me off are these people that go around with these big smiles and hearty personalities ALL THE TIME. Nothing seem sto phase them or make them deviate from their ""norm""....death of a loved one, job loss, etc. They always see a silver lining so bright that it probably blocks out every other fucking colour to them. 

And what does the mental health profession have to say about this? Absolutely nothing!!! I'm sorry, but just because you are outwardly happy all the time doesn't make you exempt from having mental illness - in fact, I'd be willing to bet that there's a whole lot of repression going on inside that mind. But that would make this JUST AS BAD a s chronic depression. 

As much as I hate struggling with depression, I hate seeing people who are the exact opposite. Don't make me puke!!!

I may only be 19 but I'd like to share what I wrote with all of you as well. I love you all and I'm always here if you need someone to talk too.

When I graduated this year I tried to make a little speech. I didn't rehearse it, or plan it and was pretty nervous so it wasn't much of anything. I'd like to try and share again what I said. I said how as we move forward a lot of people expect that life will change so much and become so much better just because you are moving to a new location or part of life but I don't think that's true. The only way life is going to change is by the change in your mind. The movement of the clock doesn't produce newness of life, but the movement of your mind. Everyone is going through a change. To a better level of yourself. Don't let your old habits dictate your life. It is cliche but new year, new you. I'm tired of doing what I used to do, if I always do what I've always done ill always be where I've always been. The real battleground is in your mind, you lie down with it, you wake up with it, go to work with it, you smile in front of others when no one knows whats going on inside. You will never be defeated by what others say about you, but what you say about you. New life comes from a new mind and a new way of looking at your life. For those that are close know I suffered from a lot of depression, and eventually suicidal thoughts this year. I owe so much to my friends and family who supported me. Let this be the year we change our minds. I cannot step into the future and still think in my past, I cannot let the rumors and the stain of what they said about me destroy my opportunity. I cannot drag that same old mess into another year. If you do what is easy, and do what I did and become sad and depressed and let life knock you around life will be hard. But if you do whats hard, and continue to work on yourself and grow life will be easy. Excuses sound best to the people who make them up. God made you and said I want you. You have to be willing to take everything life has to throw at you, but never forget you deserve greatness, no matter where you are now, keep that dream alive. You have to have faith, whatever your dream is you deserve it and it is worth whatever it takes. It was kind of rambled but heres to another year.

"I'm taking the scientific side of the story here. Life has evolved over millions of years to adapt to anything that mother nature threw at us, and here we are, humans, in all our glory and achievements, still scaling new heights.

What do we live for? Different individuals will give you different answers, but the top dogs in history came into power for reasons that boils down to one thing, immortality. And no, not literal immortality, rather, to immortalize their name in the books after they've passed on. We all fear death, but what we fear more is to be completely forgotten.

If that is the case, then our rat race, arms race and hardwork all comes to naught in the face of entropy. It's far from now, astronomically far, but know that the universe will tear itself apart one day, not even subatomic particles will be there. This, this is a fate worse than death. All life, heck, even inorganic matter will be pulled apart. So why are we trying so hard to leave a mark in history if nothing matters in the end?

Love, life, hope, dreams... It all doesn't matter. No wonder people want to believe in religion, to escape thos nihilistic despair.

But hey, this is just science, and science is as good as human ingenuity and observation. I'm sure there are things beyond our comprehension, perhaps there really is an afterlife where it's paradise?

But now I'm back in education, I socialise a lot, having people over, going to parties, going to the gym keeping my fitness up and working out, as well as trying to script or at least write down for all the ideas I have for film college, but none of it matters because I'm not happy, there isn't an hour that goes by that I don't think about suicide.

I've been clean from self harm for probably 8 months but lately when I look at my scars all I can think about is doing it again. I don't have time to go inpatient and the suicidal thoughts keep getting worse.

I have people who love and support me but I still feel like I'm letting them all down. I don't know if my family will accept me because of my transition. I haven't told anyone but a few but I'm positive my older brother outed me to everyone and I'm too afraid to face them now. Im not ashamed of being trans but I am afraid of losing the last of my family.

I can't hold a job because of my PTSD. I can't keep friends because I don't think I'm good enough for them and my BPD just makes it harder to connect to people. I'm avoidant as fuck and all I want to do is shed all my mental illnesses and not have to feel this way anymore.

I've failed trying to kill myself. I've failed academically. I've failed friends. I've failed my therapist. I've failed myself.

What's left when nothing you do is good enough?",5,"complete and utter disappointment,couldnt take pressure, dropped out, evI'm faking to get out of responsibilities eryone seems mad, psych office has me on probation, family treats me like"
"Ok, been thinking about posting here for a while, so here goes. Sorry in advance if I end up typing a wall of text. 

I feel like a failure in multiple aspects of my life, and I'm beginning to wonder more and more why I'm forcing myself into this mediocre, oftentimes miserable existence when i dont see anything to look forward to.

Lets start with my love life - there is none. Im a 26 year old guy and haven't even so much as kissed a girl - pathetic.  I cringe at myself even typing that, but there goes. And anytime some situation occurs where I can ""make a move"", I basically freeze up and back myself out of the situation somehow.  At one point I could say it was because I was afraid of doing something awkward/embarassing, but now I don't even know anymore - somethings wrong with me. 

My work life isn't much better either. I can't say they're terrible jobs (i currently work 2), and I'm fortunate that I get along with all my bosses and coworkers, but they're dead-end jobs, only one of which is related to my degree in graphic design.  Speaking of, i realize I don't want to be doing design either. Others I know in the industry are passionate about what they do,  sketching daily and designing in their free time. Not me - it all seems kind of like a drag at this point, and I usually end up feeling shitty about what I make anyways.  I do stencils and screenprinting stuff on the side,  which I enjoy somewhat more, but with two jobs the time and energy to do these things is lacking.

I only have two jobs to deal with extra expenses stemming from another failure of mine - I got a DUI in 2014, and while I paid back the court and am out of the legal system, i still have high car insurance and owe my parents money. Not to mention the regret of having ever been so stupid to drive in the first place. Its still there. 

I honestly want to do voice acting, like cartoons, games and (if i was fortunate enough)  movies. Its something I feel more passionate, and even more confident about in my ability.  But a large chunk of my mind tells me im going to fail,  that i just think im talented (like one of those american idol contestants who think they can sing), but I'm just a hack. And again, I'm almost 30. I feel like it's too late to get into that kind of industry and expect to be even somewhat successful. So i dont even know where to start. 

Im so afraid of taking any risks in my life,  that I cant really live life at all.  So what's the point in continuing on like this? Drifting from day to same fucking  day? 

I don't think I could commit suicide because it's been something that has effected my family (friends of ours that had done so), and I dont think I could do that to my family.  Even then,  Id probably be too much of a pussy to go through with it anyways.  But Ive been thinking about it more often lately

I just hate who I am, but I'm too scared I'll fuck up again to take the risks and try for the life I want, or that I still don't even know what i want in life anymore. I don't know how to fix it, so why bother sticking around anymore? I'll probably still be just as alone and miserable 20 years from now. 

Thanks for reading my griping if you got this far.",5,"feel like failure in multiple aspects, no love life, no work life, trying hard, hate who Iam"

Yesterday my neighbors threw a party and I live on a military base so the walls are thin. They were being so loud and I like to think I'm a nice person. I usually take people's shit because I feel like I deserve everything bad that happens in my life. But last night I took a stand. I asked them if they could quiet down. They didn't quiet down so I got mad and frustrated. I usually do nothing and asking them to quiet down took a lot of energy from me so I called military police after that everyone left and I felt good. I felt like I actually stood up for my self for once. Next day I wake up and I tell my husband that I called the police on them. And he mad me feel like I shouldn't have done that. Am I wrong for calling the police on them? They do this every week. I've been in alaska for 6 months now and this is the first time I have every done somthing like this because I put up with people's shit. I just feel worse now because I thought I did the right thing but according to my husband I'm such a heartless person. Now I just feel awful agian. I think about just killing my self for the most littlest things. Like somthing like this. But then I think of my 4 year old son and what life he will have if I'm not there. And how selfish of me I would be to end my life. At the same time I think he would be better off. I just don't know how to cope with feeling like this everyday. Being an army wife and a mom to a 4 year old is just too much. What makes matters worse is I have no friends to vent about this. And I never ever post stuff on reddit. I'm just tired. So tired. ,5,"called military police on neighbours for loud music, felt good,  stood up for self for the first time, husband got mad, only living for son"
"I've never opened up to anyone, in person or anyone I know in person. I've only ever been honest when talking anonymously with strangers on the internet.

Basically this lame nearly-20 year old has wanted to die for five years and I'm now at the point where it's get help or just do it already. so I changed doctors, the switch finally went through today, but I can't bring myself to schedule an appointment. I've lied to my family, friends (the one I still have lmao), and doctors for years. How can I be honest now? 

does anyone else struggle with this? being unable to open up? I've emotionally isolated myself due to fear of vulnerability and self hatred and I don't know if I could ever open up during therapy, let alone at a doctors appointment about requesting therapy. I get shakey and anxious and want to puke just thinking about it.

It's so bad that I won't even come out as a lesbian, even though my family is very liberal and have told me multiple times if I was it'd be fine. but being honest/emotional/myself just feels terrifying. Obviously - I've never been in a relationship either because of it.

"Shorter but less detailed version at the bottom...

Useless backstory info: I'm a 17 yro closeted bisexual (mostly on the gay side) teen in the homophobic south. That's not completely my problem. Recently I've been feeling so numb to life and it's to the point where I don't see the point in living anymore. Thing is I'm afraid of dying. For a long time now I've been feeling alone and like I have no one in this life. People are the only thing that make life worth living. I'm not a shy or awkward guy but at this point I don't have many friends in my life. Awhile ago due to uncanny luck I started working at the same job as a guy that I've liked since nineth grade. We also take classes together this year. I don't know what I did but we somehow clicked and became close friends (not THE closest but close). He's a feminine guy so there was a time when I thought he felt the same way but do to his homophobic remarks about other gay people and him showing me a lot of the messages from girls he's been with (the normal guy thing I assume) I made an executive decision to back off of him in that way. However at this point in my life he is one of the only friends that I got and also (again despite us not being that close) the best friend I've got so I really don't wanna lose him. It feels like lately we've been drifting apart despite my absolute best effort to be more talkative, be funnier, and at some times pulling away do to me feeling that I've been coming on too strong. Losing him is my worst fear in the world. Not only is he the best friend I have rn but he's also a guy that I've liked for a long time now. It's like because of my apathy towards life, my loneliness, and my lust for him combined he's subliminally become my reason for living. I've been depressed for a while now and it's a sad thing when you at an age as young as 13 are trying to decide what song you're gonna kill yourself to. The only reason I'm still here today is because I promised myself that I would at least wait until the age of 27 to see if the shit about life getting better is true or not and I chose 27 because of Kurt Cobain. If I'm gonna die why not die with an artistic aesthetic in mind. However everyday I feel worse and worse and I thank my mom for being a responsible one and hiding her gun because idk if I'd be here today. With all that being said my question is this: Should I ask my mom to see a therapist/ psychologist or whatever? The reason I have to ask is because I fear my mom asking me and forcing me to tell her what I'm so upset about and I also fear not knowing what to tell the therapist and just wasting time and money or speaking too much and ending up in some kinda mental hospital. The worst part about all of this is feeling like I don't even have anyone (irl) to express my feelings of sadness to. I just feel like a dog in a cage and all I ever do is go to school, work, the come home and go to bed and I don't know what to do anymore. Am I just gonna be another gay statistic.

Short Version (less details): 
I'm a southern bisexual but mostly gay kid who's felt extremely lonely to the point of suicide for a long time now. I randomly by some stroke of luck became friends with a feminine guy who I've been enthralled with feeling for since 9th grade but found out he was straight. We're slowly losing our bond and I don't know what I'll do without him considering he is my only good friend at all rn. I'm feeling lonely, depressed and suicidal rn so should I ask my mom to see a therapist?

I may post this in more than one place btw.",5,"closeted bisexual  teen in homophobic south,feell numb and alone, no one in life, shy awakward, not many friends , had interst in a guy, backed out ,lonliness, apathy towrads life"

"So I guess I could start by saying I know people out there have it worse than me, and maybe constant suffering is really worse, but I can't stand going back and forth. Good days, awesome days, absolute shit days, mediocre days, ad nauseum. I'll even go from a decent day like today to shit. Really the back and forth has made me realize how shitty the shit really is. It gives me perspective. You could say that is true of the opposite, but all I can think is that the good is amazing, but temporary, always temporary. 

Seeing that distinction is driving me mad, and I don't believe I have anyone to go to about this. I've tried with several people, and I don't get anything. Always sinking back into that realization that the few people in my life have shown themselves to not give a shit is so, so depressing. My happy days are the days I live for myself and forget about my relationships with other people, but that's an impossible life to live permanently because we all have relationships whether we want them or not. 

If I were to contact all the people in my life and tell them I'm going to kill myself, they would be concerned, take the necessary steps to stop me from killing myself, then go back to their lives. This is sort of a tangent, but I'm starting to simply feel like a pawn in other people's lives. Now that I am a part of some people's emotional landscape that they want to keep intact, I can't go. Fuck that.

"Im trying to resist the urge to delete all my social media and disappear. After trying to reach out and reconnect with old friends over the course of the year, it just feels so stiff and like... what the fuck does my input matter when they have a solid group of friends...? I'm an outsider. Usually it's fine. I've accepted it for the most part, but some nights like tonight it's just so crushing to realize that I've slowly melted out of touch with people I used to be so close with. Now they've grown out of me like an old sweater. They have a group of friends and stuff. Which is completely great and fine... I'm just so fucking lonely. I wish I had friends who also considered me a friend...",5,"trying to reach out and reconnect with old friends, feel so stiff, everyone has solid frinds, I'm an outsider"
"I am not much of a people person, more often than not I am forgotten.  People don't gravitate towards me, rather, they tend to stay away.  I try to be sociable, and pleasant, and kind, but it doesn't seem to matter.  People have already made up their minds about me, which is sad, but true.  Some people are just born with it, I guess.  No one wants me in his/her life, there are far better people out there.  People who can sustain a conversation, and be confident and lively.  I am not that person, I used to be, but not anymore.  That part of me is gone, and I don't see it coming back.  I fill my time now with other pursuits, mainly writing and creating videos, neither of which are good.  My writing is terrible and my videos make no sense.  Hell, I tried to make a serious video today, but had to play it off like a comedy because it was downright awful.  I can't even vocalize my feelings properly, nor have anyone truly listen to what I have to say.  There is no point in trying anymore, I feel like giving up.  There is a strange sense of calm to that realization, and it feels more comforting than it should.  I wish it could be different, but sadly, there is no other way.  I suck at everything, except being sad, which ironically enough is what I am trying to rid.

Like ""youre selfish"" or ""that thing you do is weird/gross"" or something like that? Its always been really hard for me to describe this experience but its the one thing that makes me cry almost every time, depending on how close the person is to me. and it happened again recently. its horrible how it feels.

"Mindless Self Indulgence - It Gets Worst comes to mind immediately.
This song is pretty much my theme song.

I also enjoy Black and Death Metal a lot.

I sound like some dumb edgy kid, but music like this gives me peace.
It fits in with usually how I feel.
If I try to be social, I just push people away. Making new friends or find a girlfriend is pointless.
Silence is beautiful. My shitty voice will ruin whatever conversation is taking place.  I should have my vocal cords removed.

Literally feel like my life was taken away from me. Don't even know how to sleep at night without knowing she's with me. 


I don't have the grades for any university, and community college will be a waste of time. I don't think I even have the ability to succeed in a trade school, cause even there, you need social skills to become an apprentice in your trade. So I can't even become a plumber or a garbage man.

"It's bad. I'm a quiet person. But now I'm realizing that the only times I'm not quiet revolve around times I'm talking about things that are depressing, like my depression or ptsd. It's like I have no sense of humor or have no personality other than that. I'm trying to build one now that I realize that, like develop interests and such, but it's a slow process and I've never ever been good at making friends. It's like, to make friends, I have to put myself out there, but when I put myself out there, I just suck at it. I am not present. I question in my mind, what do I say, does this sound stupid, and I hyper analyze my and the other persons reactions and what they say and do. It's ridiculous. I have no self esteem. 

I'm 27 now, just recently got approved for disability, and feel like a loser. I have a few ideas how to meet people and rebuild my life, like a local place that offers drop in support groups or meetup.com but I just feel so lost. I haven't graduated college and my boyfriend of two years just broke up with me, and my whole social support network revolved around him. I'm not used to being on my own.

How can I make friends? I feel like I missed out on vital parts of life where you learn that :/",5,"depression, PTSD, no personality, not good at making friends, feel like loser, feel lost"
"I'm an infrequent poster here on other accounts, none of my posts have ever gained much discussion or traction. That being said - I'm desperate, and lonely.

I'm not sure how I'm any different, but perhaps a letter from rock bottom might result in a ladder back up to life. 

_____________________________


Hey, everyone. 


I understand that in the past year or so, I've been pretty distant and non-communicative in person and over the Internet. This is no fault of your own, and I'm not a smug elitist bastard - or, at least, I try to avoid being that. For a long time, I've been afflicted with depression and it's affected every area of my life. It might seem obvious to a few of you, but even then, it's so scary to admit it. I'm afraid no one is going to give a shit, or think that I'm looking for dramatic attention. Hell, it's just a bad idea to come forth, because no one wants to deal with that kind of additional stress. I've lost or damaged relationships in the past trying to get people to understand, but all I did was bring them down with me, drowning them in the details. 


It's not an excuse for me to be a shitty friend, though, and it's definitely not a good idea to let it manifest in cutting people out - people that have supported me, that I've had good times with. I don't expect your sympathy, trust, support, or understanding, even. I just want to be a better person for you all. 


I imagined how other people would imagine their own funeral. Maybe you want a dramatic crowd, maybe you want your intimate friends and family surrounding your casket. It scares me to think I might have zero people around to remember me as someone worthy of being called a friend, or worthy of sharing a bloodline and a name. It scares me to think that the only recollection someone might have of me is a two sentence tidbit, and not a pleasant one at that. So I'm sorry. I'll be better. Tell me if I'm not, and if you could so kindly give me advice to be a better person along the way, you have my gratitude. If you want to talk or message me, let's catch up.

"THIS IS A FOLLOW UP TO MY PREVIOUS POST

I always thought school was the real life version of hell,until I got my one month holidays,and started feeling dead,and super depressed,partly caused by loneliness,so at that point,I was desperate to get back to school,and I missed my classmates/cunts so much.

The day came,2/1/17,The start of school,I was just moved up to grade/primary six,and we now sit in pairs instead of groups,well,at least I thought...

out of the 39 students in my class,I was the unlucky one who got to sit alone,I mean,the teacher could just make one of the pairs into three people,but know,I was alone,at the back. What was so disgusting about this is that my teacher wanted me to be more social for a very long time,and yet she chose to let me sit alone and die inside,even when there are so many choices to get me together with other classmates/cunts.

Not only that,My co-form teacher asked me if I was fine,and I had to say yes,since I was the 'invisible' kid in the class and no one cared for me,and if I said no,I know for a fact that she would just call me a complain king,fucking fuck.

Now this part is the most painful to sit through,A girl that I liked and had her existence very much appreciated by me,was right in front of me,she had a partner,one that I thought was very childish and a trouble maker,I have to go through SEVEN miserable hours seeing them talk in the most amiable ways,while I just sit back in my area,having my soul to deteriorate by the seconds.

Well,at least she is happy,fuck I want to die.

Maybe I am a failure and maybe I never will amount to anything, but how will I know if I never try or believe in myself. I will use my nihilism to succeed and be happy. This is the only life I've got, and someday I'll be dead and forgotten. So why waste it being sad. No longer will I romanticize my depression and let it get the better of me.

"Started a self defense class in November. Have gone 2 times. Took 3 weeks off. They probably think it's for the holidays but I was sick. I hate the class. I feel inept and like a complete dumb ass but one kid gave me some respect and shook my hand so that felt good. It's mostly guys in there so I feel like there's less of the fakeness you would get from women. 

I think I would like the class if I were good at it and felt like I fit in better, but I'm completely self-conscious and I suck at some of the moves they teach us. I got owned by a couple teenagers the first week I went, made me feel like crap. 

I've never been much into sports. I deeply wish that someone would've taken time out of their day to help me understand sports or develop my athleticism but no one did. 

This kinda feels the way church used to. The longer I would skip out on church, the less likely I would be to go back and the more guilty I would feel. 

I do have other stuff to do. I think I'm about to lose my job so I could apply for jobs, I could play video games, I could learn how football works, workout...

This class is just so damn far out of my comfort zone. Please comment. If I don't go, is that self sabotage??

I have for awhile had this weird thing were I separate my concious and subconscious and end up conversing with myself. I don't always agree with myself thow and sometimes contradict myself in weird ways. my subconscious will be scared but I won't be scared. that doesn't make sense. I will talk and act one way but then the next day act as if I am someone else.



ussually Iignore myself but my subconscious (I nicknamed it sub so I will refere to it as that) tells me to stop. this is hard to explain so if you want to know more you can ask but for now I am going to move on.


I don't think I am that good of a person, I have a strange desire ti physically and/or mentally hurt others. I try to put this at bay with things like video games and drawing (I draw alot of violence) but I still don't know why its there and it won't go away.



I gett very lonely but never want to interact with others. I'm very asocial a bit more than just being introverted. 

I don't like telling people about my feelings because I don't like being vunlerable. I get anxiety at random times and sometimes fear for my life when I am alone for no reason.



I don't feel happy nor sad but I don't know if I want to change this. I lack motivation even to do things I like.I get frustrated and angry when I make mistakes and often give up easily.

I'm messing up in school, I am too lazy to do things and my mom isn't very helpful about it.

"Hello everyone, first time in this subreddit, not really sure though if this is a right one to tell my problem, so excuse me if it isn't.
Don't really know where to start. Thought what I wanted to write and it flowed like water in my head but it is a little harder to organize it properly here, so I will try to explain my situation as best I can.

Long text ahead.

I am generally a closed person, 25yo male, I have a few friends and some of them are really good. I can't make friends easily nor hold proper a conversation when meeting a stranger. I ussually cut it off quickly, especially with a woman and it feels to me that I act like I am in a hurry and it usually feels I don't really care about what they have to tell me about themselves and act like that, whether it's a man or woman. I am not impolite or anything like that, i just can't keep the conversation flowing. Sometimes when I consiously want to talk with acquaintances or try to meet someone new, I just don't know what to say, usually in this case because I don't want to insult them somehow and I end up not saying anything or very few, resulting sometimes in akward silences.

I just started on a temporary work 3 months ago moved from my small hometown to a big city. It took me, I think a lot of time to start getting comfortable around my coworkers (as most times). All of them seem funny, good and open people that won't get offended by anything I would say, either to get to know them better or just to make some fun on our break. But they are not really the case on why I am writing this.

My problem mostly lies after my work on me socializing with other people. I generally enjoy sitting alone in my house, spending time in the copmuter mostly, or doing the daily chores and a little exercising. I used to live with my parents before getting the job and I hated being in the house with them (I want to mention here that I don't hate my parents at all, I love them and respect them very much). Spent my time closed in my room on my computer, or outside with the friends I have in my hometown. Which are all male by the way and the closest I have. The few rest that I have in the city that I work are mostly old friends from when I was young that we just kept in touch. Nothing more.

As I see other people in the streets with girlfriends or even being friends with them and I am kind jealous, not in that specific person I see, but on the general relationships that I whitness. I beat my head on how to find a solution on this, but whenever I am invited from some of the friends I have here, I am generally too bored to go out with them and prefer to stay alone. I mostly am bored to go out with them, because they are male friends as well, as I don't know any of their girl friends that hang with. Even if there would be girls in that company, I still propably wouldn't go because of the reasons I described earlier. I would be too bored to get to know them or just wouldn't know what to say, staying completelly passive. I feel kinda sad to myself when I get to take some long walks in the city where I see all these people socializing having relationships. But when I get in the silence if my home, 99% of the times that feeling just goes away

(Kinda TL;DR) I am in a situation where I am content that I stay alone in my house, where I have peace of mind and without having to act fake to talk with people. BUT I also want to find a girlfriend, to try to hang out with the friends that I have here and maybe meet some new, either through my friends or through work but I find it completelly boring/tiring to get in the process to do all that and I just prefer to stay home in the end.

Is this depression, am I just shy, or is it that I don't really like socializing?",5,"have few friends, I cut off quickly, especially with women, cannot socialize, want a girlfriend"
"i've been alone for 2 years or so. I'm kinda better now, i'm working, and i have friends in a nearby city,but i really miss the complicity of having someone in your life.

last year i was making some progress and then i blurted out that i had depression and she never talked me again.

in your experience, is there a way to have more confidence about it? do i keep it to myself? do i stay alone?

"I'm 14.
For few years i have thought that i'm just really unlucky.

My longest friendship has been only one year and finding or even getting friends is an everyday strugle for me.

It is the thought of thinking that the world would have plenty of problems gone if i wouldn't be alive.

I have a feeling that everyone just hates me. And i should just find my tree and apologize to it for wasting its selfmade air.

My personality moto is ""whatever i own or have touched or is really important to me, is getting ruined, broken or lost""

Today i destroyed so many things without even knowing it and i just thought

What if i crossed the street and a car would ride over me

What if the building sudenly would lose balance and just broke over my head

What if i would slip and crack my head open

What if...


I'm too scared to atempt suicide but i still wanna die... i want it to be an accident 

The thought of death is scary itself but at the same time angelic to me

The only person who i think would give a damn about my life is my best friend

The only person who understands me and listens to me

The only person who can make me smile even if it is the hardest day

Not my mom or dad, i don't even have siblings, but my best friend....


I always thought that the every second possible accident anywhere where i stand is just messed up brain and now i think it's depression.


And I am the only one who knows because i hide beneath a girl with realy colorful hair and a lots of smiles.


But the thing is...
THATS NOT ME",5,"really unlucky, getting friends is struggle, everyone hates me, "
"Before you begin to read, here is some informations about me:
I'm Alex, 15 year old. I live in a small city, so if somebody does something, next week everybody knows about it. 
I'm suffering from depression for I don't know how many years.
I always was the backup person, so I got ignored a lot.
I remember I just sat in the hallway of my school, alone, noone cared about me. Not even the teachers.
I play a lot of video games, isolated from the others, and I have only a few friend that I can play with.

So, earlier I realised that one of my freind is changed. He does not care about me anymore. He said that he s#its on my depression right in my face and he is trying to ignore me. Wich one is not that good of a feeling.

If I write to him on Steam he sais that he is playing with someone else ALWAYS and then rarely respond to my messages.
--
If I write to him on Messenger he reads it, and doesn't respond to it.

He is that ""I live in my own world and I dictate my own rules in case of friends"" guy.

I had a few problems with him earlier in 2016 and in 2017 too.

Today I asked him a few questions (i'll write it in hungarian, and below that in english):

Me: ÅszintÃ©n: ***** vagy Ã©n? just asking
Me: ?
Him: mindketten a barÃ¡taim vagytok what are u f*** g*y to ask that
Me: nope
Him: csak ***** nem szokott okoskodni

Me: kivel jÃ¡tszasz szÃ­vesebben, ez a kÃ©rdÃ©s vagy napok Ã³ta a fejemben van
Me: ?
Him: *****
Him: mivel Å nem okoskodik mint te
Me: vÃ©letlen kilÃ©ptem tsrÅl lol ( totally was on purpose)
Me: akkor have fun with him, in the rest of  your life
--
in english:
--
Me: To be honest, *** or me?
Me: ?
Him: You are both friends, what are you f****** g*y to ask that
Me: Nope
Him: Just **** does not complain that much as you do.
Me: But you have better time playing with ****than me, just asking (because I realise it)
Him: Because we love the same (game) both
Me: Who do you prefer playing with? (me or ***)? This question is in my head for days.
Him: *****
Him: Because he does not complain that much as you.
Me: Accidentally left from teamspeak (it was totally on purpose)
Me: Than have fun playing with *****, in the rest of your life.

"Sometimes I feel bad because my depression is not as bad as some people who commit suicide or live in constant agony. Even posting this was hard because I thought people with ""real"" depression should be helped first. 

I have been in and out of depression for the last 10 years. Mostly bouncing between deep apathy where I didn't care about anything and extreme joy and euphoria in  3 month cycles. It all ended about a year ago when instead of apathy and numbness I felt deep sorrow, sadness and grief and got stuck there. No more numbness or euphoria just always feeling sad and wanting to cry but not being able to. Also feeling like there is no hope in regards to any aspect of my life. I almost never leave home in the last 2-3 month except to get food and run errands, luckily I work from home and I really avoid all human contact except my girlfriend. I even stopped responding to calls/texts from friends because I feel like no one really understands what I'm going through and everyone just wants to say ""ohh toughen up, life's hard, get your shit together, stop feeling mopy"".  My work is suffering since I cant really concentrate on it and Im worried I might loose it. I feel deep shame and regret because I achieved nothing in the last 10 years of my life (my 20s) nor did I have any fun most of my peers had. 

I feel like I cant go on like this because its a horrible place to be stuck in and I want to seek help but I am confused where to start. 

Should I looks for a psychologist or psychiatrist ? I dont have suicidal thoughts I'm just really scared I will live like this for the rest of my life. Is my condition psychological or physiological ? Is there a test to take ? I'm really against anti depressants due to the scary side effects but I'm opening up to the idea slowly if I know 100% that that's he only way for me to get better. 

Are there any resources I should check out ? I really dont know where to start. I appreciate any help I can get.

"First of all I just need to get this out of my body, you dont have to read it or reply.

To begin with this was really horrible month for me. 
Besides all my bad emotions I can still actually enjoy things, still do something. I met a girl, she is really interesting and cares about me, you know that goth girl into David Bowie and Oasis era, freeminded smart and everything. I kinda needed this, someone who would fullfill my desires and bring te burried passions from me. I WANT TO LIKE HER, but my mind keeps tellin me its not enough like i dont need it, all my mind cares about is pleassure, to feel god. This relationship kills me. She likes my hair, but I am losing one side which makes me totally depressed I can't even count things i avoided because of it, keep checking if another fall, keep looking at them. I am also really skinny and my pose sucks so hard i hope she doesnt care... She invited me like before Christmas to sleepover oh boy i was so glad even i wasnt thinking we could have together something, I mean its awesome to drink a bit and spent nigh with someone you like watch movies listen to music and stuffs. We got kinda drunk and she asked me to kiss her so i did, I didnt need to have sex with her even I kinda wanted to try it for first time but it was ok, i just took of her bra and we had great time.

Next day i was happiest human on earth, trust me, pure euphoria. but i started overthinking it which was a huge mistake I mean we was drunk. I met her today again to make it clear for my mind I think she again enjoyed time spend with me then we kissed and It actually felt again good kinda weird but good... anyway i was depressed, melanholic and tired from everything i wasnt able to enjoy it. She cares about me, she likes me but i dont really think I am able to.

Drugs. I smoke for 1,5 to compress somehow everything, i know its bad i hate myself for it. I tried to stop few times but i felt like it wasnt me, i didnt feel addicted i jsut felt dead inside. Ive been drinking sometimes with friends and hell its so good, i still think about being drunk because its so good feel and that scares the shiit out of me jesus i am afraid, really afraid. We used to in this cold make firecamp drink and chill and trust me, those were best days ive ever head, spent time with people i like people who likes me and know me.. i never felt more happy than this birthday (turned 17 this motnh) cause we enyojed it together.

I was never like most of people (not into way am different) I had not like favourite sport i did long time, i have not hobbies, interests... ive never felt blithely. All i do is listen to music and surf net. I feel like i know every good band and i am afraid i wont find another :( 
Ive got bad grades, my parents and grandparent hates me for that. I hate myself for that but with my status i cant do anything, trust me. My best friend is lazy and addicted to weed, other i dont like that much and they are also lazy, well im too but i wish i could enjoy myself more. do stuffs, see shits.
I wish i was able to work and make some money but im too psychicaly exhausted its impossible.

I feel ill, do i need a help? I cant describe how i feel, its horrible..i sometiems fantazire about killing myself, i wouldnt do it, but i FUCKIN WISH I KNEW how it feels to be dead. ANYTHING than this really.

Also my grandfather died who i never liked, all he cared about was my grades. My mom woke me up with this massage and i didnt feel a bit sad, I felt empathy for parents and grandma but nothing else... it destroys me i have to write this but my mind was thinking about stuffs he left so i could get it. That day we had after christmas lunch and all they were talking about was funeral and how I should learn and learn things to avoid bad stuffs. From that time my mind got seed that like when i grow older i wil jsut piss out of family and forget on everything.

i need to listen music loud, I am getting addicted to anything what would let me get out of every emotion.

I haven't eaten in 2 days. I smoke two packs a day. The most sleep I've gotten in one night was 4 hours. I get stupid stoned every night. I don't care whether I lose my job after being unemployed for a year. I'm being pressured to live up to certain expectations. I sometimes drink a whole bottle on a week day just to see if that doesn't get me killed. I constantly imagine ways I could die from things i see on my way to work. I feel nothing yet I'm constantly terrified. I crave intimate contact but I always push those away that try and get close to me. I hate that it feels like people think I'm disgusting. Unattractive. No confidence. A burden. I saw a co-worker break down in tears today after hearing her father passed. I wished someone would cry like that for me.

Let me just say I have the job I've been wanting since i graduated in 2012. The people I work with are the best people I've worked with so far. I've made many friends the past 2 years. My artwork has started to become popular on social media. Financially I'm quite stable. I kissed the girl I've liked for a while on New Year's Eve.

Yet it seems there is no point to any of the good or the bad. Nothing matters. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing will save me.

"I've been with depression for about a year now and right now I think I am at my worst. The thoughts of ending it all are going through my head more than I've ever had it before and it's because I have a solution to my pain but that solution will only cause more pain for me in a different way. I don't know what to do and I feel like I need some help. 

My decision revolves around my religion. I am a member of the LDS church and have been all my life. I was raised with it and I believed in it to the full extent. However nowadays church is a pain to go to and anything having to do with god is like a pin prodding at me. Church has turned into a shaming session where when I do go I hear the speakers talk about certain things and I always come to the decision that they are talking to me and pointing out what I should be doing. Even in Sunday school I feel like that's happening. So to avoid this I go to church and play on my phone the whole time which is not the point of being their in the first place. So I feel like I go and ruin the next couple days for myself or I go and feel like a rude asshole for not paying attention when I'm in class or in sacrament. 

So the solution to this problem is obviously just not going but I fear that the things that will come of that will destroy me and my family even more. My dad is very connected to the religion and heir already seeing my falling away and I can tell he's disappointed. I feel like I'm failing him and that leaving will only make it worse. Not only that is there my brother who is unstable and has anger and control issues who I think that if I leave he will follow. That is not what he needs and I think the church is the best thing for him so the idea of him leaving is not something I want to see happen. Not only that but if he leaves my father will probably be even more disappointed not only for me But for my brother. 

I need to come to a decision here but both options are awful. I can either be selfish and leave while ruining my family in the process or stay and endure my pain and hatred of myself for the rest of my life. I have lost hope in myself and hopefully you guys have some idea what to do cause I'm sitting in bed crying over this situation.

I feel as though I either was born in the wrong time period, or shouldn't have been born at all. Do any of you have advice or guidance on what I can do to figure out what to do?

"Hello r/depression, I have been staring at my phone trying to call the samaritans (UK helpline) for the last hour. But I can't work up the courage to actually speak to a person so I came here. I've been wanting to kill myself recently; and the multi-storey car park I could jump from is a 15 minute walk away. Recently the temptation to go there is getting strong. 
The only time in my life where I don't feel constantly pushed down on by a crushing weight is now, when I'm in bed. When I'm at work I feel like everyone is against me or wants me out. I bumble through my day only speaking when spoken to, and everyone looks at me very disdainfully. I feel like I am always being ridiculed and watched for any mistake. I feel like they gossip and bicker about me behind my back, and will jump on any opportunity to force me out.
I come home and I am responsible for my younger sister who is 18 and doesn't have much time for me. My mother lives with us but she not able to help due to suffering from mental illness. I make a dinner for my family and then have no choice but to be alone. I am so lonely I feel like I could cry.
I am 28, and the last time I had a girlfriend I was 19. I can't see how I can continue living being this miserable. Only the thought of my sister being upset stops me, but I'm beginning to think she wants me gone also. 
I don't sleep much anymore, and I feel very isolated from everything. My general thoughts have a kind of far away feeling to them. I can only deduce that I am severely depressed, so I am posting here. 
Not really sure how to end this, but thanks for reading. ",5,"depression, only time feel not crushed is when in bed, at work everyone is against me, gossip and bicker, at home responible for younger sister, mother uninvolved due to mental illness, no girlfriend, dont sleep much, isolated"
"I moved to a new city away from my family and friends and ex-SO for the greatest job opportunity I could ask for right out of college. And somewhere along the line of my first real week of days off, I realized that all I did was work and I was just curled up in bed every second I was not working. I've thrown myself into a job so completely that I didn't even realize I stopped eating and slept too much. Now I'm back at work, and I didn't realize how lonely I felt being so far away from everyone I ever cared for. It's just a part of growing up, right? But I can't help but break down in the middle of my work day and lock myself in a bathroom trying to breathe. I've suffered from depression my entire life, but it has never been this bad. I've lost over 20 lbs and I was already only 5 foot and 110 lbs. And my apartment is pristine because no area but my bedroom has been used. It's been 6 months of this. 

I'm giving up and trying not to give up at the same time, if that makes sense. I decided to come home from work early today and cook myself a decent meal for lunch tomorrow, and it's the first thing I can say I'm proud of actually doing, but I feel pathetic at the same time. That that was all it took. 

I've been go go go my entire life. How do I stop and learn how to...survive?",5,"moved to new city from family and friends and ex, all I did was work, thrown into job without sleeping or eating, cant help breaking down in middle of day, giving up, feel pathetic"
"I've been unhappy for a very long time. I am in high school and I'm currently on my winter break. I've hated school for the last 6 or so years. 

Even though I despise it, I generally do pretty well. In elementary school, I got 90's and stuff without much difficulty. But when I started high school, my marks were a lot lower and I realized I'm not smart like I thought I was. It took me until the last semester of grade 10 until I was satisfied with my grades. I got all 90s and I was pretty proud of myself. I even won an award for history. 

Now I'm in grade 11 and I'm getting 90s in every course except music. I actually am getting a 60% which was the lowest mark I have ever gotten in a course. I'm pretty devastated because I have been practising like crazy. My teacher is also pretty considerate and let me redo a few things which I continued to fuck up. If you are in music, you have to take band which I enjoy. But this year you have to take it twice a week. One of the days I have to stay at school until 7 pm and I always feel really sad after. I'm just not enjoying it anymore. I know I probably shouldn't take it next year, but it feels like such a waste since I've devoted so much time to playing my instrument. I just feel so shitty. The class average is a 91. I am pretty sure I'm getting the lowest mark in the class.

I enjoy getting high marks, but I am a horrible procrastinator and I always stay up to like 5 am working on assignments. I have no motivation until I absolutely need to get stuff done. I just feel horrible when I get low marks. Everyone at my school is uber competitive and I feel like garbage if I get anywhere below a 90. I hardly pay attention in class and I always save things until the last minute. It's like I enjoy making my life more difficult. School has gotten harder and the stress causes me to cry often.

I don't have a girlfriend, and I don't have very strong connections with any of my friends. I don't enjoy going places with people. And I feel uncomfortable talking to them outside of emails, texts, and Facebook messaging. One of my friends always makes jokes at my expense when we're around other people. I often make self-deprecating jokes, so I am normally okay with it. But he takes it a little too far sometimes. I'm not the best at controlling my emotions -- I smile and laugh at inappropriate times -- so when I try to tell him I don't enjoy it, he says that I'm lying.

A couple years ago I ended a friendship with an absolutely toxic person. I'm glad I ended it, but he was also one of the only people from my old school. I really felt betrayed by what he did to me, and it still kinda hurts. I don't have many friends.

Every single day is the same old bullshit. I just sit there at school waiting for it to be time for me to go home. And then I go home and do nothing until it's like midnight and I need to do my homework. I hate my routine, I wanted some sort of change. But then I got some change and I hate it so much.

A week before the winter break started I found out that my mom has breast cancer. I'm scared and sad. I'm trying to remain optimistic but it doesn't look good. I had to spend that last week in class while my mom got subsequent testing. It was awful to have to wait all day at school. The worst was when one of her meeting with an oncologist was on the same day I had band. I had to wait until 7 until I found out anything. That's when I found out that she would be going through chemotherapy and then eventually surgery.

I had a history test that week. I'm sure I didn't fail it, but I don't think I got higher than a 90. This sucks because history was my best course and I felt proud of myself for once. And now I feel guilty for worrying about something as petty as a test.

Now it's over a week into the break and I'm just wallowing in self-pity. I barely leave the bed. My passions are to read comics, watch movies, and I'm trying to write a screenplay. For the first few days of the break, I was mildly productive. But now I don't even do anything. I have so much to read but not enough energy to actually do it. I am wasting my break.

We found out that her cancer spread to her bones. They aren't going to have surgery anymore. She is going to go through months of chemo in hopes that they will just make the cancer controllable. Best case scenario, it's a lifetime condition that they just need to closely monitor. Luckily, the chemo that she is going through isn't as intense, so she is not incapacitated. She's still working and stuff. Her hair will still likely fall out in a week or 2. She has an MRI and a CT scan on Friday -- we'll know if it has spread to any organs. 

My sister is in town from university. I haven't really talked about it much with my sister or my dad. My dad seems like he is trying to ignore the whole thing. We're not the most talkative family.

I tried talking to a friend who doesn't go to my high school. He is extremely unhelpful. He barely reads the messages I send him. A week ago, I told him my mom was starting chemo the next day. And he immediately changed the subject to what he bought on Boxing Day. I get that it's awkward, but all I was looking for was a friend to talk to. I didn't message him again until today. I was also pissed that he didn't think of messaging me to ask how things were going with my mom. He was going through his own personal shit a few months ago, and I listened and tried to be a friend. I feel like this friendship is extremely one sided and I need to end it.

I love my sister, but she keeps on pressuring me to get my G1. I know I should, however, I just have no motivation whatsoever. And I feel like I would be an incompetent driver. I constantly fuck things up. I can barely get motivated to study for a test at school. I know driving isn't necessary at the moment, so I can't get motivated to study for it.

School is starting again on Monday. I'm going to have so much work to do because exams start at the end of January. I have so much work that I could be doing over the break, but I just keep putting it off. I have a group video or something due for history sometime after the break. My group wants to start filming Thursday or Friday. On Thursday, my mom has chemotherapy. And on Friday, my mom has more tests. Even if I do get a ride to someone's house, I'm going to be thinking of my mom all day. I don't want to be a jerk and screw over my group. But I really don't want to film those days. Also, I'm really not close to anyone in that group to tell them what's going on. It would be really uncomfortable telling them and I don't know what other day we could film. I also can't get motivated to do any work or research. 

I don't want school to start again. I hate it. It's so stressful and I'm so unhappy. I had so little motivation before I discovered my mom has cancer, and now I have even less. I know I'm going to have a shitty time.

I am starting to realize how screwed I am for university. I don't really have any accomplishments. I've done nothing significant. My only highlights are my grades, but they are not even that great and I don't know if I can keep them up. I want to be a screenwriter, yet I know that it is nearly impossible to be successful. I just know that I'm going to fail at it like everything else in my life.

I don't have anyone to talk to. I feel alone and scared. I'm not suicidal (there are too many movies and television shows to look forward to even think about that). I am not very charismatic. Or athletic. Or smart. I doubt anyone will even read this.

"I know right. The feels. I don't expect any responses. I just like this subreddit because it's good to get your thoughts out there every now and then. I reread all of this and I wrote way too much. It's basically just an essay about my current state of mind in regards to mostly romantic relationships. Normal relationships are a whole other story.

There is something fundamentally wrong with me. It's not even part of my depression I think. It's part of me. I don't feel human because I don't think I contribute anything to society, and what seems to be a lack of wanting to interact with society.

Am I okay with being alone? I like being alone. I will have a twinge of loneliness occasionally. I'm sure if I didn't have my online friends I would feel loneliness more. I feel like I lead two lives. A social life online, and a lone loser irl.

I'm wondering what is stopping me from finishing my okc profile. I don't want to put the pictures on there. I don't want to write anything positive about myself. But most of all I don't want to interact with any of them. I don't want to meet anyone.

And I don't think it's just a fear of men. I think it's a fear of people in general. What good are they to me? Relationships with real people are too complicated too exhausting. Making conversation is excruciating. I become way too invested in other people and they don't reciprocate. It's painful.

Physical contact scares me. But I want it at the same time too. I have memories of being very young and wanting to be carried. But no one would carry me. My dad would carry my sister then be too tired to carry me. I grew to hate touch. I hated it when distant relatives would visit and want to hug me or kiss me. My parents barely ever did that so why should some strangers.

The best days I've had recently have been the ones where I have been completely alone, completely uncontacted by family. And I usually spend them alone in my apartment. Like a zoo display.

Love and companionship. I crave it and hate it at the same time. I go through periods of extreme sexual frustration where I long to have a partner. But the thought of doing something so intimate with another human frightens me at the same time. Sex is a mystery to me still, at 26 years old. I've watched porn, I've read erotic fiction. I've read about techniques and experiences others have had. I can do things that are close enough with other people online. But the thought of meeting in person to do anything is scary. I've had opportunities but I don't want to follow through with them.

When I was 14, I had an online boyfriend. He lived a few hours away and we wanted to meet eventually (although even then I had my reservations). He was 4 years older than me. My parents knew nothing about him. When he called my house my mom yelled at him and told him to leave me alone. We pretty much broke up after that. I felt ashamed and stupid and very bad that I caused someone else pain at the same time. I worried my parents and I fucked up the guy. Can't do anything right. Anyway I believe that first ""love"" of mine, and its conclusion, left an impression on me. The worst part might've been that after the incident, my parents never really could talk to me about it. They would try and I would deny it because I didn't trust them. And they kind of just dropped it. Maybe it was worse in the end because it seemed like they didn't give a fuck and went back to doing whatever it is they do instead of parenting.

After that first one I fooled around here and there, and had a second serious boyfriend when I was about 16-17. He was 6 years older than me, and lived across the country. He was very sweet and never pressured me to meet up or anything. I know there's also the element of me being a minor and them being older. I was never abused though. Maybe emotionally confused at times.

These little contained online relationships satisfied me well enough. I could get emotional companionship and sexual release. Usually without having to see their face or have them see me. After those two I've dabbled in similar more casual encounters if I ever feel the need.

The only real life thing that happened was freshman year of college. There was a guy I found cute. He was in 90% of my classes. It seemed like he was flirting with me because he was always distracting me from my notes, and sitting next to me in lecture halls. I hugged him once, and felt really fucking awkward and hated it. My height. My height is awkward. But that's only a contributing factor. It's that it's unnatural to me. That whole stint ended badly with me putting myself out there and getting fucked over. And my way of getting over it was to cut him out of my life as much as I could, and apparently to give up on looking good and gain 20 lbs lol!

So why should I make a dating profile where I'm expected to meet them in person. It's not necessary. If I don't I won't have to risk being hurt or revealing how awkward I am. This whole profile business seems disingenuous. I misrepresent myself because in words/online I can seem amazing. I'm okay at taking pictures that make me look halfway decent. But I realized I look awful irl. And my personality does not match up. I'm pathetically ""shy"" you could call it; or just mentally ill. I hate having to write positive things about myself to make it seem like I'm all gung ho for dating and human interaction. I don't want to sell that false image. Then one day they just realize that I am just a big bundle of depression and anxiety. A burden they weren't signed on for.

I kind of digressed fro the original topic I wanted to dissect. I am not physically attracted to most people. I can find women beautiful sometimes. And recognize when someone meets society's standards of beauty/sexiness. This has torn me up inside for years. I'm so confused about my sexuality. Men are hardly ever physically attractive, but I enjoy their companionship. Women like I said are only rarely. For the most part, I can only be attracted to people if I know them for a while and get to know their personality.

I'm at a stage where people are just trouble to me. I don't want to deal with it. They've hurt me too much in the past so I guess it's that I've learned to stay away. Self preservation. I'm not a risk taker. I have not had many positive interactions with people. I try too hard to fit in. I just want to be unnoticed.

When I was younger I had fantasies of becoming a functioning adult. In my fantasy I would've already been married and had kids by now. I don't think that will ever happen. And I've pretty much accepted that and don't really care any more.

I think its this unenhanced version of sexual/emotional frustration that prevents me from trying harder to assimilate with society. To pursue the role of a lover or my ""endgame fantasies."" I know I would make an amazing girlfriend/wife/mother. I would devote my life to my potential loved ones. I'm probably the perfect fit for some gamer guy out there (minus my depression and anxiety and secret desire for constant attention). But it just doesn't seem worth the trouble of going through the motions to get there. What's the point?

What would even make me happy any more?

"Hi guys. Not sure where to start.

I hate school. I am a Junior and I am a straight A student who takes harder classes. You might think that would make me tolerate school, but I absolutely abhor it. I take no pleasure in my success, I have a bad anxiety disorder which will often debilitate me. I recently transferred for reasons I will talk about later. Because I'm new, I have no close relationships with anyone, and it's honestly understandable considering the people in my classes either feel extremely douchey or disinterested. I was never good at making friends IRL anyways I guess, I always tried to keep my social life online. I hate my teachers too, they'll often make me feel like they're under-qualified and that I am not getting the material I will need for the exam. I wish I could drop-out, I really really do, but I have no justification if I'm doing well. I'm almost off Holiday break and I have never been more anxious in my life.

My parents literally do not know the pain and discourse they are putting me through. They recently bought their dream property and they've made me move into the the place and go to school there. My life was put on hold and rapidly changed instantly. The place is in the country and is so isolated; half the time I am there, I am alone. When you're anxious about school and are completely isolated, it is the worst feeling ever, and some days I feel like I am going to die there, unhappy. They thought I would like it as much as them, but I do not. I hate it so much, I just want to be somewhere with good internet, TV, and proximity to civilization. Unfortunately, even when I express my pain, it mostly goes unheard.

I have friends online, and we're all mostly like minded people. For a time, it was great because it was the only place where I felt actually welcomed. We play games together, but I cannot anymore because my parent's new place has satellite internet with data limits. Because of this, I have grown so distant from them. Whenever I can chat, I feel like a waste of space. Only one person has truly expressed interest in what I have to offer socially, but the rest seem distant. I had plans to meet these people, but now, I feel like it is a waste of time. This means my social life is in crisis mode, along with my sanity in my own home and with my patience with school.

I wish I could stop everything and relax. I know life doesn't work that way, but if it doesn't get better, I feel like I will burn out and go crazy. I wish I could stop. I'm probably going to regret making this post in the morning but whatever, I just need someone to acknowledge my pain and maybe give advice. I do go see a counselor but I can never open up. I'm not sure why.",5,"junior and straight A student, abhor school, no cloase relationships with anyone, no social lifewnat to drop out, parents not know of pain and discourse they are putting me through, shifted to new property, I hate it so much, want someone to acknowledge my pain"

The last seven years have been rough.

I've been in and out of depression most of my life, without realizing it because I thought that was what normal was. Seven years ago (seven?!?!) I realized that I wasn't mentally healthy. At the same time I was going through other stuff, was self medicating with weed, and had no direction in life. I had a massive breakdown/depression. Barely got out of bed, wasn't going to classes, couldn't even hold a conversation. I sort of pulled out of it but not much has gotten better.

Ever since then, i've been fighting the good fight but with little to no results. I've basically lost all of my friends or don't talk to them much. Even when I do i can't get past the fact that i went/still am crazy and can't just relax around them. Pretty much the same with family. They're more or less supportive but holidays and get togethers are fucking painful. I usually try to drink myself into being social with varying effects. 

I forced my way to getting a degree, even in that depressed state, because I didn't know what else to do. No idea how I can use that degree. I'm working a shitty job at a bank now and seem on the verge of being fired. I don't have the energy to grin and bear it. Depression is not great for customer service. I don't want to work at a bank. But i don't know what else I can or want to do. 

I'm so fucking lonely. I have no idea what to do with my life. Every day is a seesaw between extreme lows of depression and extreme highs of serious anxiety. 

I was against antidepressants but at this point it feels like I need to try something drastic. I tried Lexapro a while back for a few months and didn't notice anything change.

Anyone have any thoughts? all this time and it still feels like I'm at square one. Would really appreciate anything helpful.

"Two years and some change ago, I left the Marines to attend college and move my life forward. Even before separating, I had severe depression and anxiety issues that helped me make the decision to leave. Soon after I separated and began my coursework, my depression exploded to the point where I couldn't do anything and my anxiety to the point where I was terrified of leaving the house. I want from straight As in one semester to Cs the next because I could never make myself go to class, either because ""it wasn't worth it, I'm going to fail anyway because I'm awful"" or because I was terrified of being around people.

I tried therapy. First, I want to a private practice where I was told that nothing is wrong, everyone who leaves the service faces this and gets over it eventually. She had no answer when I brought up the 22 movement, which infuriated me even more and showed me that I wasn't going to get help there.

Next I tried the VA, which only made it worse. After trying to get me to wait for months (it took the therapist (or what I thought was a therapist at the time) calling to get me in her currently empty schedule), I go through months of weekly visits that go along these lines: I walk in, she asks how my week was, I answer and give her my journals she has me write, she asks for any clarifications needed (what does this word mean? who is this?) and then sends me home to write for another week. Nothing changed, nothing helped, she was basically just a living journal I recited my life to. Once I found out that she wasn't actually a therapist but a temp holding the position until they got an actual therapist (she admitted she didn't actually have the ability within the VA to do more than prescribe me low-level medications, which incidentally didn't include anti-depressants), I stopped going. She had noted that she believed I had PTSD but due to her temp position could not diagnose me as such within the VA.

So I tried for a few months to handle things myself and spiraled downward even more. Moving towards divorce with my wife (I wanted it because I finally realized she is a large part of my depression), I tried the VA again now that they had an actual therapist in office. Got checked in to the psychiatric system (didn't happen last time), so got a whole therapist/nurse practitioner/psychiatrist team to help me. Went great until I left to visit family for a month, things got worse with my wife and I isolated myself in my house again. Where they had me once diagnosed with PTSD, and thus my care and medication was free, I was sent a letter informing me I owed the VA for all my medication since I was no longer service-connected (they went back and now denied that my service had anything to do with my mental state).

Adding to that, I panicked and dropped out of my courses for a semester and now owe $3000 to my university, effectively ending my courses and thus my GI bill benefits, which I was using for housing. With no money, I now had to get a job. That was August.

Since then, I've applied everywhere from McDonalds to senior IT positions as long as I met the qualifications. No part time work has come through (only response has been Best Buy that told me four months later I was not getting the job), entry-level IT positions are worried that I am over-qualified and will leave when another company offers me a better position (every HR that has given me a reason for not hiring me has cited this) and higher positions won't hire me because I don't have my degree, even when it is listed as preferred in the job description.

The worst part was the holidays. Stuck alone with my soon to be ex wife and listening to what few friends I have left tell me how great their christmas was. I'm not about to have them stop, even though it just rubs in that I sat home alone over the holidays, because over the past year I've lost almost everyone I'd considered a close friend and I'm terrified of losing the two I have left.

I have no idea what to do. Two months and I'll be homeless. And that kills me because I have a dog that I don't think I can live without (the only creature left that I feel truly gives a damn about me) but I'm not willing to take her to the streets with me.

"I've just really been struggling the past few years in my home town where I still live. I'm lucky to be able to still live at home with my mom and brother who care about me while I work full time and have pretty cheap rent living at home while I pay debts off. But other than that, I don't have much else here. I have no friends and a lot of people who know me or of me really don't like me, which is a mixture of things I've done to push people away but also things that I have no control over. I do have a good career path I'm happy to be in, merchandising for one of the 3 major pop companies and the opportunity to move up and even transfer. Since I don't really have anything where I'm at right now other than my job which I can transfer with, should I just bite the bullet and move away when I can afford it after my debts are paid? I'm just really scared that things won't be much better for me especially since I'm pretty Introverted and don't do things like go out to bars like most people do my age(22) since that's just not the scene I'd like to socialize in.

it's not even that people just don't want to deal with me, whether its my close friends that I used to open up too. (Found out quickly that they weren't close to me at all because they all left me) The worst part is is that when girls talk about their depression or their anxiety people are like ""Awww do you want someone to talk to, are you okay?""

 But when guys talk about feelings our depression I just can't because I know all they would do is just pay no attention. It's so dumb.

Am I the only one that thinks like this? Because I've never seen any guy open up about their ""depression"" if they had one they usually keep it to themselves.

"People I encounter, family, co-workers, employers, peers, use this demented perversion of Darwinism to suggest that I am unfit; that I have to be the one to adapt and adapt while the world remains static. They say, âItâs adapt for dieâ, and if I canât adapt then I donât deserve to be successful. Many people act as though because I am different that the onus falls entirely upon me to change myself. If I am a round peg and the only opening is a square hole, then I am expected to what, use brute force to fit in? Thereâs no concern for personal tolls it takes to force myself into a place I donât fit into, and if I canât handle the pressure, the personal damage incurred by that process, then I get labeled defective, mentally unfit. My father tells me to follow the Marine Corps motto of, âadapt, improvise, overcomeâ, but life is not a military operation.

Instead of people trying to meet me half way, instead of people seeing the value in diversity of thought and trying to accommodate me even in the slightest, I am condemned for not being endlessly adaptable. I am not some âUbermenchâ, capable of endless internal rearrangement, I am a human person! Of course I can change, I can adapt, but I canât be someone entirely different; Iâm not clay you can just reshape over and over again! 

I suppose itâs easy to level such criticisms when you are arenât different, when youâre not the one being told to give up what makes you who you are; when youâre a square peg trying to fit into a square hole. People who donât have these difficulties say to me, âwhy canât you just be like me? If I could be successful, anyone could, so if you canât itâs because your just being obstinate and unreasonable; itâs your fault and you need to changeâ. Others take a more defeatist, pragmatic view and say, âthe world wonât change, so you need to. If you try to be different youâll just be tilting at windmills. Thatâs just the way it is, so just conform to whatâs expected of you and be pretend to be happy about it.â 

It makes me bitter, and people see that bitterness as unjustified and roll their eyes at it, only serving to intensify my bitter feelings. Why wouldnât I feel bitter? I struggle and struggle, only to have others devalue my experiences and scoff at my pain; to label me with all sorts of offensive stereotypes and make no effort to understand my position. People say, âdonât be bitter, itâs not attractiveâ, but what else am I supposed to feel? Iâm sorry the way I feel isnât attractive, but itâs the way I feel and no amount of scorn and disapproval is going to change that. Wouldnât you feel bitter in my shoes? Fighting an uphill battle to just be yourself, without support, without validation of any sort, while no one seems to take you seriously? Am I supposed to just lie and counterfeit myself my entire life? What sort of life is that? Itâs one thing to struggle for find you path in life, itâs another to have those who already have spit on me the whole way.  

My therapist once told me to pretend to fit in, to just fake it until I feel it, but I never felt it; I just feel more and more empty and dead inside. I feel progressively hollow, depleted, eroded away. I fear that one day there will be nothing left of me, that eventually Iâll be nothing more than a zombie, shuffling from place to place without thought, without feeling.

Iâm sorry Iâm different, Iâm sorry I canât just be like everyone else and feel good about it. Iâm sorry about it every single day; I am made to feel sorry about it every single day. If I could I would be someone else, but I canât. I only hope one day someone will value me for who I am, instead of who they want me to be.

"Is... Is this really a thing? Another post recently had a reply pointing this out as a possibility of being a thing.

 My life isn't bad. It's not great, I'm not homeless and I have food and a roof... But I just feel like everything is wrong so often. If left to my own thoughts I sit and dwell on all I;m done wrong, how I may have upset people that day, do people actually care? Am I being manipulated for their gain and it's all fake 'love' towards me? 

I don't know what's wrong. I sit and cry for no reason just because nothing feels correct or right, but I don't know what's wrong about it. I'm afraid of upsetting people so I always shrink back at conflict. I'm afraid of seeming too needy so I never tell people when something is wrong. 


I have someone I care about, but I'm so afraid of burdening them with more problems about myself, when they have their own stuff to deal with anyway. It's not a... 'relationship' in the common use of the word, but someone that is important to me, so I don't feel I have the right to pester them or drag them down. And what would I tell them anyway? ""I'm uspet because nothing is right, but I don't know what right is, so I don't even know it's wrong anyway?"" That doesn't work... 


I'm not suicidal. I have no right to be. I don't think I have half the problems those that stand on that cliff must have in their life, so how could I possibly consider doing that? I just want to sleep so much. When I'm asleep I don't think, I don't dwell on how I feel. 


It's so dumb. I worry over even stupid stuff in video games with friends. I switched servers in a game recently, and I still contact and talk to all the people from the old server, but I still felt sick as I did it. I sat and cried over slighting those that I left behind on the old server, because I left them behind. 


Is this dumb shit I sit and think and do Depression? These thoughts of being worth nothing, thoughts that I'm hurting everyone around me by existing, forcing them to interact with me like I'm the unwanted little brother of your best friend that his mom forced him to bring along to play with. 


But now I have to wonder if I just manufacture all this myself. Make myself feel negative about myself to get... whatever I get out of that. Loop it around, driving myself more and more downward.


I dunno why I posted this really. Maybe I just want people to at least see that I'm not all there. I tried so hard to hide that from those I care about, that maybe nobody knew something was wrong for the longest time. So... Thanks for reading this.",5,"sit and cry for no reason, nothing feels correct, afraid of upsetting people, "
"When I look at everyone around me, they all seem happy and motivated to live out their lives at least to some degree. They look like they have passions, and interests and things to live for. 

I can't seem to find any of these things for myself anymore. Everything feels so mundane. Pointless. I work and work and work and then I get this tax return that's lessens as I work harder. And for what? To build this life over my span of consciousness just to have it all disappear and mean nothing when I die? 

Life is painful. I feel like I have to fake emotions and reactions to things just to get through the day looking ""normal"" to everyone around me. This inescapable feeling of hopelessness just won't go away. No matter what I do. I try and change something and it still hangs over me. 

I feel like no one will understand the way I feel. I can't even fully understand it, let alone put it into words. I can't even bring myself to end it all because I think of how much it would hurt the only family I still have left. Everytime I've come close to ending my life, my mind floods with images of my sister finding my body and just breaking down.

"THIS IS A FOLLOW UP TO MY PREVIOUS POST.

Start of 6th grade,my classroom was empty and as a class,we were assigned to decorate the classroom.

After years of miserable group work,I realised that no one accepts my opinions,this time was stupid as I am one of the best students at art,and NO ONE asked my for help,they kept calling me irrelavant and useless.So I decided to sweep the classroom,as Singaporeans,we never-EVER,clean up after one another,So the class looked like the aftermath of a party,From then,I started sweeping for hours,instead of appreciating me efforts to help,many just laughed at me for being that ""Cleaner boy"" and others made facial expressions that looked like I was bothering them,whenever I went to their side to clean up.

After that,I went for a rest,at my seat,which a group of people are working on stuff on,when I jokingly said a joke (Obviously),they just shooed me off and called me ""The useless one"",seriously,did no one realise how clean the room was after I swept?

Now the most horrible part:Some time later,get this,MY TEACHER COMPLAINED ABOUT HOW THE CLASSROOM WAS DIRTY!At this point I was all ready to commit murder already,fucking trashwhore,If i didn't make an effort to clean up the class,I tell you,bitch,your classroom will look like a fucking garbage disposal.

LITTLE THINGS THAT RUIN MY DAY:

I went up to a group of kids,and kindly asked if they got any trash for me,one of them said: ""YOU!"" I laughed it off,but deep down I was heartbroken.After the teacher complained,I was pissed,some one asked me for help,and I said no,he said: ""Why did you not help us the whole time?"" I swear,if I was in the US with that fuckboi,I will shoot off his limbs and pour salt on the wounds.

YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THIS PART IF YOU READ MY PREVIOUS POST.

"I met Annie in 5th grade (I am in 6th grade now),In 5th grade,there was this camp where we are supposed to go to,we were supposed to make new friends and know each other better,fuck all,that shit was completely neglected throughout the whole time,The camp was where I first started to like Annie.

How we first talked was fucking stupid.on the first day (Night),we were supposed to prepare for a dance,there was this open area where we would practice,that time,I was bored af,I had no intrest in dancing,being the fuckface introvert I am,I looked around,and saw this screen-door thing,which led to what looked like complete darkness,I mumbled ""Hmm,what's in there"",Then out of nowhere,Annie said ""I don't know,you go in first and tell me""
At this point,I could take the oppurtuinity to introduce myself,try to start a conversation,or get to know her better,but instead,I said ""Nah,ladies first!"" Till this day I still question my past.By the way,Annie was awkward and witty,exactly the same shit as I was,so at that point,I started taking intrest in her.

Next semester,3 months later,Annie and I got into the same group,I wanted to know more about her,so we talked a bit,and my god,she was the girl of my dreams,Other than being witty and awkward,I then knew that she was the cutest little thing ever,and her voice,jesus it makes me jizz myself every time (Joke!).From that point on,we were really good friends,we were talking about random shit every minute of class,and had a wonderful time,her existence made a shield around me,all negative thinking,depression,existential thoughts,would be repelled from that ""Shield around me"",I was looking forward to school every night,and I constantly felt in love even though I have no idea what she thought of me.She was so awesome that even if she friendzoned me for life,I would still remain cheerful.

We had too much fun,our teacher fucking seperrated us,immediately,I went from ecstatic to suicidal,I cried myself to sleep almost every day,fantacising of us together again.

After the suicidal thoughts,I was always sad,negativity could easily penetrate me without that ""shield"",She would sometimes react to my jokes,but that's it,I never dared to speak to her since then,I hate social anxiety.

Annie,where are you?Depression has overtook me,judging from our history,only you can help me,I really miss having that ""Shield""...",5,"the girl I liked does not like me,negative thinking, depression, existential crisi"
"I'm gonna write an essay venting here so incoming wall of text.

I see a lot of posts on here which revolve around unemployment, lack of academic achievement, ""failure"" in one aspect or another, and I can relate to those things, but I'm on the other side and I feel worse now more than ever.

I've always had depression come and go, and maybe that's generally normal, but I did relatively well for myself anyways. I had fun in college, met some really cool people, was in a frat and a few other organizations, generally had a good time. I don't think I've ever had a close friend but that never really bothered me, I am super introverted by nature and can easily spend a month without human contact and be just fine. I graduated with a good major and good grades, I got a good job right out of college at an employer that hires 1% of applicants, 3 months later I quit because I got an offer from another employer that hires even more selectively, I moved to a cool city on the west coast. I don't have any large insecurities, I feel that I'm relatively smarter than most people, a good employee and a person worth hiring at any job in my field. I do fine with women generally, never had a serious girlfriend because I always lose interest in people and I prefer being alone when I'm not working because I find people to be exhausting.

I have a cool apartment in the downtown area, I have a ""great job"" which people are jealous of, old friends hit me up asking for interview advice and references. I'm 23 and on my way to making 6 figures relatively soon.

I did everything right, my parents are proud of me, everyone treats me well, and even more so when they know you're successful and have money, but that can be an entirely different post. All this doesn't even matter because I'm more depressed today than I ever have been.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I have no true for ambition for corporate life, I find everything to be pointless and stupid, I'm really fucking good at pretending to be ambitious, and telling people what they want to here which is why interviewing has always been easy for me. But at my core, I don't give a fuck about anything, I feel like a zombie working from 9-7 every weekday to finally reach the weekend, have it fly by and then rinse and repeat. I really just want to do NOTHING, maybe read something I enjoy, play some video games, or find a new hobby or whatever but working makes me want to kill myself more and more everyday. 

Does that make me lazy as fuck? Probably, I don't know, that's what I get told whenever I express discontent with the work life. I don't care about material things beyond a few necessities and some hobbies. If I had enough money to pay my rent and a little extra for the rest of my life I would quit immediately.

My only goal in life is to have enough money so I don't need to have anymore goals. Goals are bullshit, ""oh if I work really hard I can be the financial MANAGER in a few years and make more money, then I can get a cooler apartment or a nice house and continue slaving away until I'm an old man die."" It's all just bullshit, who gives a fuck. Why would I want a job with more responsibilities which gives me more money I don't use, it all feels like a giant joke.

The only hope that keeps me going is somehow finding a way out and having enough money/passive income to retire, but the thought that it may take 15 years or more makes it seem useless. I feel like my youth is slipping away, I'm tired everyday, I have trouble sleeping, even my hair is starting to fall out which is fucking depressing.

I have a few thousand in savings after sending money home to support my parents, with barely any free time or energy to find something I can invest in. I'm stuck working and watching time fly by week after week. It feels like a hopeless cycle with no escape, like no matter what I do I'm destined to working some zombie office job until I'm an old man until I can finally retire and die. I want to throw all my money in a business idea or something but with my current energy and time and mental state, I would probably fail miserably and lose all my money and go back to square one.

Everything is depressing, I just want to disappear.

Does the mind rule the body or does the body rule the mind ?..

.I'm in a really strange place right now. I know I have depression (at least I believe I do with my family history). But I usually find myself getting depressed about things I see in the world. 

For example just seeing how much sex is exploited. Just seeing the thumbnails of YouTube videos of women showing off their breasts and how these videos have millions of views. It just bums me out.

Seeing hate and violence on tv. It really just gets to me. I start getting really upset when I see how shallow/ easily tempted/ lead people are. 

Is this normal? Is it the world doing this to me, or is it my mind? 

I've basically lost everything these past few weeks..my belief in a god, my friends, my hopes. I now have only one real person I can talk to. I want out. And I've had enough, where is there for a person like me in the world to live ?

The only thing I've been able to think about tonight is how dull and boring my 18 years have been leading up to this point. I haven't accomplished very much at all in 18 years and everyday i feel worse about it. Well I've made a firm decision to change my life tonight.
Tomorrow morning is my first day back at school, and my first day as an adult,after two long and lonely weeks of Christmas break. I've been ignoring my depression for a long time now, and I'm just now starting to acknowledge the reality of it. I'm already trying to get myself on the right path and basically this post is some sort of icebreaker to try and get involved in the community and to get some tips on staying positive, and some positive and insightful perspective on my life.

" I walked in on my first day of high school a depressed kid. i made some friends, they showed me that life is more than just moping around and working to get a diploma to mope and work more. They are the best people Ive met in my life so far and i would protect them with my life. i care for them a lot and would do anything for them.

That was 3 years ago, and of course, im still a depressed kid with friends. However, i think about killing myself on a weekly basis, and openly say that i hate myself to a lot of people. it has become common practice to say these things, like a shield to desensitize me and other people from mortality and the worse of the world. I also secretly hope that this softens the blow if i ever decide to jump off that overpass in my area. 

I want my friends, family, and everyone im connected with to remain happy and normal, so i put on that fake smile and pretend that nothing is wrong aside from the therapy that doesnt work. i value other people's happiness more than mine (for reasons that would make this post too long) so i keep on smiling and repress emotions until i walk into my room and shut the door. everyone i am connected with doesnt know im suicidal, i dont want them to worry about me, just to remain happy. and if i kill myself they would worry and get sad too, like me right now. i am living for other people because i dont want them to know the truth. i am a prisoner of other people. 

i just want to know what the hell am i supposed to do, and that im not alone in this world

tl,dr: i made friends in high school and started to care about people in my life. but im depressed and dont want anyone to know that im mentally ill and suicidal because i want them to stay happy and not worry about me. so i live with a false smile on my face, and keep my emotions to myself. what the heck am i supposed to do?",5,"walked first day of school as depressed kid, made some grate friends, want to kill self but concerend about friends, family and everyone in contact, keep smiling and repress emotions"
"I wish it would go away.  My brain struggles to handle the fact that nothing matters and becomes disgusted with things like religion that give hope.  Everything is so seemingly random and purposeless.  Whenever I think about my life, I always feel so out of control.  I had no choice in my existence.  Everyday life without my distractions of fantasy..through games and TV shows..is meaningless and awful, yet I must participate to keep consuming the media that I truly live for.  I work and get education in an exhausting cycle every day..for an uncertain future in a VERY  fucked up and disgusting world in light of recent events.  How do I cope with the feelings of dread that wash over me?  I guess I'll try to answer for myself.  I just keep distracting, keep consuming media that gives my life interest and purpose.  Yet, as of late even that hasn't been enough.  I need the bigger distraction of other people I guess.  I want to socialize and build relationships to strengthen my life's meaning, but this is really, REALLY fucking hard.  Reaching out to people in today's American society is like jumping off a bridge in which you'll land on your feet or face first.  As an American, superficial and acquaintance relationships dominate.  The real struggle is to create something more.  I'm really afraid that my exhaustion will soon outweigh my desire to consume more media and the relationships I have by the time I have my BA degree.

"Im sitting in my bathroom 1/5th deep with a belt wrapped around my neck just trying to get something out. I am generally a relatively passive depressed person. I feel like I am hyper-aware of my situation but I don't feel emotion like I should although I feel it welling up in me. 

Why can't I cry? I feel like if I could ball my eyes out I would be fine after but I just can't do it. I am usually content with my emotions but probably once a week I get this feeling that I need to coax them out to get some sort of release. It's like there is this immense pressure inside me and all I need to do is turn a valve but I can't find the right one.

I want to die. I am very close with my family which stops me, but only because I can't stand the idea of putting them through that. I understand that I am lucky to have people who love me so much but more often than not it feels more like a burden than a blessing. 

Im not super emotional that I want to die, rather i'm pretty passive about it. In my mind this seems a completely logical solution to my problems. I still love my ex girlfriend, I have self-esteem issues etc but at this point none of that really seems a factor to me. I have felt this way for a long time, much longer than my present problems are responsible for.

I have friends who are enlightened as to my situation and they try to help but everything they say goes in one ear and out the other. I don't think I'm actually going to do it tonight. My mother always jokingly said that you should always keep your house clean in case you died tomorrow. I feel that way now. There are loose ends to be tied up before I did anything definite.

It would be so much easier. It frustrates me, no it pisses me off sometimes that suicide is considered such a selfish thing. What about me? What about what I feel? Is a life lived for other's comfort really worth living?

I guess what scares me at this point is that the idea of suicide doesn't scare me anymore. I have my ideas about what might come after and I think it's eternal peace. Afterlife or not (veering towards not) I have the opportunity of eternal rest in front of me so why not?

I don't know why I am posting this. Maybe I just want to air my grievances before I leave this place.",5,"generally depressed perosn, hyper-aware of my situation, immense pressure inside me, I need to turn valve but cant find a rigth one, super emotional, still love ex girlfriend"
"For a long time I feel like I am just going through the motions. Feel empty, last funeral (late 2016) I went to a very close family friend who treated me like a grandson but I felt nothing. I just felt nothing, like I was waiting for it to end. For last 3-4 years it has been hard for me to feel anything. 
I haven't been feeling suicidal at all but I wish I could feel. I haven't been happy for awhile, just want to lie in bed all day. I don't even know what to do anymore. I feel like a hamster in a wheel, just moving in place. I have always been the odd one in the family, I try to put on a smile. I smile on the outside but inside is nothing. 
The family disappointment, the one who everyone sees as the family loser. Its like I try to feel something. I try to make myself angry so I can feel something, anything so I feel alive. ",5,"feel like going through motions, feel nothing, like hamster in a wheel, family disappointment"
"My depression has taken everything. I'm nearly 30 and been suffering with depression for 10 years. 

It just gets worse. I lost my girlfriend. I can't work. I can't  be around for my family. I had to move in with with my Mum in a tiny box room that I can't be bothered to keep clean.

I've been in bed for two days, I haven't even showered. I barely eat.

I'm on my second medication and this one has no effect either. I'm on the waiting list for therapy but it will be months before I can speak to someone.

I my life is just getting wasted and there's no sign things will get better.

No question to ask of Reddit, just sharing my experience.

Happy 2017

"Not sure how to start this. So ill start by telling a few things about my life.

I am a 23 years old male, living in brazil, currently working with IT. 

My parents and my girlfriend are really supportive and i don't really have big problems in my life, which leads to the big issue: i feel like complete shit.

Despite having a job, a car, a girlfriend, a place with people that i know that love me that i can call home, i still feel like complete shit and knowing these things and not understanding why i feel like this makes me feel even worse.

I have tried suicide in the past and these thoughts are behind me, but the feeling of being worthless and that im not accomplishing anything haunt me everyday. 

I would appreciate some help on this.

Thank you and Sorry for the rant.",5,"parents and girlfriend really supportive,, dont understand why I feel like this makes me feel even worse"
