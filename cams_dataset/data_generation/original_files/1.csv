"My depression is catching up to me... again... right when I think I'm doing alright, the drowning begins again. I'm tired of running around in circles to get away from my demons only to end up consumed by them anyway.... 

My life has been constant ups and downs, from abusive parents and partners, to self sabotage and circumstances out of my control that almost ruined my life... 

When am I going to stop being punished....? I'm a good person.. I try to be... why do I keep getting handed sour lemons when I try so hard to be happy and make good lemonade? ",1,"abusive parents,partners,self sabotage"
"I'm not a strong person. At all. I've had an ok life, but I was coddled and overprotected for the majority of it. Now I'm 22 and every time something happens to me, I tell myself that I would honestly rather die than fixing it. 

I'm pretty obese, and my roommate tells me that I need to lose weight. I honestly would much rather put a shotgun under my chin and end everything. I don't want to work for anything, I don't really want to put effort into my life, especially when I already hate it so fucking much. I drink about 2-4 energy drinks a say too, so I'm pretty much just waiting for a heart attack to happen. 

I don't know why I'm posting in here. If you think that wanting to kill myself over these things is stupid, then you can honestly fuck right off. I'm sick of being told that, and the only thing that does is make me want to end it all even more.",1,"pretty obese, roommate tells me that I need to lose weight"
It all started in fifth grade.. It was there I realized what was loneliness and being an outcast. I feel like an outcast honestly everywhere and I feel like garbage of who I am. From 5th grade to (currently)10th grade I have been becoming more and more depressed. At first it just started as sadness from time to time but around 9th grade it really kicked into overdrive. Its gotten to the point where I don't truly laugh anymore or anything not even my own family make me genuinely happy. To make matters worse I probably don't have it as bad as some people here but idk why I can't get that through my head...anyways have a happy new years everyone.. Heres to another year of depression lol. ,1," loneliness, being an outcast"
"I just got to thinking about how much time I spend alone. Throughout elementary and middle school I had some friends that I hung out with. I lost them all when I went to high school, where I was forced to make new friends. None of those friendships stuck though, and I never hung out with any of the people I talked to. Imagine that: four years of going to school and coming home and spending all that time by yourself. I got to wondering tonight what that does to a personâs psycheâ¦ I like to think I introspect a lot and Iâm a thoughtful person because of it, but I think the more likely outcome of all this is that iâve become socially awkward, paranoid, and bitter towards the people around me. Iâm like a social and societal disease. Every room I walk into itâs like Iâm sucking all the energy from everyone there. Itâs like that in college too. I just started last semester and Iâve made no friends. i know people in my dorm or in my classes think of me as as that girl with no friends. They either pity me or ignore me like the plague. Sorry for the weird rant. Just wondering if anyone else feels like thisâ¦",1,They either pity me or ignore me like the plague
My âfriendsâ never talk to me unless Iâm the only one available and Iâm so sick of it but I donât want to burn those bridges cause I know itâll hurt more to get rid of them altogether than to just suck up the pain of being left out ,1,"friends never talk to me, unless I am the only one available"
"I spent a lot of time pouring my heart into a semi new friend group that I knew decently well in high school.theyâre very smart people book wise and I like talking-to them sometimes but it feels empty I miss my old friends I hold onto 3 out of 6 of my old friends.
Anyways I offered to my new friend group that I would host a New Years party at my house and they like were really into it but oddly controlling. I invited 2 of my older friends but unknown to me my new friend group had problems with them. One of my old friends was a old boyfriend of one of my new friends girlfriend and apparently caused a lot of âharassmentâ mean while this all happened 2 years ago.... I know the girlfriend isnât mentally stable sheâs off she almost killed my old friend twice but like I thought Iâd be okay to invite my old friend but I just got shit on by basically all my ânew friends â I was basically forced to uninvited my old friends but instead I cancelled the party and am now having a âsecretâ party with my older friends. I feel like my new friends are a cult I feel like an outcast. Iâm just crying in bed because I just canât find new friends. I poured my heart into people i thought that were good people but apparently theyâre so immature

"Hey. If youâre reading this then...well that means I went through with what I was thinking. Then again, it was a stupid idea so if you are reading this Iâve gone insane. Now, you will not know my name because it doesnât need to be revealed for this. Maybe someday Iâll be strong enough to face it, I mean people will find out eventually. Youâre probably really confused...so Iâll just get straight to the point. Iâm here to tell you my story. Usually I donât talk about my life...actually I really donât talk about it at all. There are certain things Iâm not going to share of course, things I vowed to myself I would keep secret until death. Honestly I donât even know why Iâm doing this. I just really need to get some stuff of my chest. Life. Sucks. At least it does for me. It didnât always..I used to be this innocent bright and cheery kid..but I guess the more I grew the more I realized how messed up society and basically the entire world is. You see, the first time I ever felt different was in 5th grade. People would make fun of me, call me stupid, tease me, call my old life weird and dumb. There were other things but I can't remember...Iâve spent 3 years learning to forget. The day it became too much for me to hold in is when everything changed. I was sitting down taking it all in when I just broke. My shield that was keeping them from hurting me...shattered into a million pieces along with my heart, my mind, my soul, my life. I ran to the bathroom and cried for what seemed like forever. I went back to class acting as if I was fine and that nothing happened. Everyday it just got worse. Then summer came, and I was able to start feeling normal. No more people to worry about, I didn't dread leaving my house. 6th grade came around, and I met the most amazing people that I will remember for the rest of my life. 6th grade was a good year, my grades were good, I had great friends...but there was still something that was off. Around the end of the year I started getting these awful thoughts. Regret filled my life. There were so many things that I wished I could redo and I still do. Everyday of my life I think about it and think of how stupid I was. Iwas so careless and didnât realize that what I had done could ruin my life. Now what I did exactly wonât be shared...if anyone ever found out I wouldnât be able to live with myself. I can barely do that now and Iâm the only one who knows. Summer came around again, and the thoughts got worse. They aren't just bad thoughts about being sad and depressed...I started getting suicidal thoughts...hundreds of them everyday. I dreaded going back to school. I had people in my class that bullied me in 5th grade. I didnât want to go through that again. So...one night I had an idea. I was at a very low point and was contemplating suicide. I ended up chickening out...but some days I wonder if it would have actually worked. Part of me wishes I went through with it, the other half is glad I didnât. School came around, I was performing well, and the kids didnât even say anything at all. My friends and I became even more close.My teachers were amazing. 7th grade, I have to say was the happiest point of my life I had ever been in for an extreme amount of time. When it came to an end however so did that happiness. Suicide crossed my mind even more, I started self harming in ways that no one would notice. I would do the stereotypical thing and just blame the cat. 8th grade came. My grades dropped. I couldnât find the energy to do anything. I was constantly tired and I still am. My dreams faded, my hopes for a better life went away because I know that would never happen. I got this app, kik. I should've known to delete the minute I got it. Part of my past revolves around this dumb app. Actually itâs what started EVERYTHING. And itâs all. my. fault. I hate myself for it. I worry about so many people Iâve met on the app. I love them all, they're great people and Iâve stopped caring for myself ever since then. I just wish everything would go away. There is honestly so much more to this story, but if I were to tell it all it would take me a million years. Now...weâve hit the present. Iâve stopped eating three meals a day. Some Days I barely get it one. But thatâs ok...I like the feeling of hunger. I like the pain of the blade when it passesover my arm. I like being alone, the less people who know me, the less I can hurt them. The more fake smiles I put on, the more people leave me alone, and believe Iâm fine. Iâm suicidal but no one knows. I canât tell anyone...I wonât tell anyone.At least personally. This, what Iâm doing anonymously is fine. I can tell my story without feeling too judged. Even if I was...it would be nothing compared to how I judge and hate myself. And now youâve made it to the end...sorry it was so long. Thereâs so much more to it than that...that's just the basic stuff behind my real emotions...the emotions that are fading. The emotions that I will soon lose, in fact Iâm pretty sure I already have.

"I'm here to share my feelings. What does it mean when you get a sudden pang of sadness that refuses to leave n leaves you wanting to cry for now reason?  I've googled it and it's given me three reasons 
1. Hormonal imbalance. 
2. Anemia.
3. Depression. 

Let me tell you a bit about myself. 
I'm Li, female, 20 years old. I've had my fair share of ups and downs in life. I was in a bad relationship for almost a year before I found the person I actually wanted to be with. But the situation in which I got into a relationship with him was rough you could say.  You see he was my best friend and I didn't want to loose him. He'd liked me for almost 2 years at that time and I knew I'd loose him forever if I kept him waiting.  But know I'm very happy I did because it's the best thing that ever happened to me.

The person before him, was the worst choice of my life, but not the first worst choice.  I've made two wrong choices in life that I regret. 

1. My ex. Initially all was fine and I liked the time we shared together. My feelings started to get strong until I was stuck in a place where I thought I couldn't be able to live without him. But sadly his feelings were the total opposite. As time went by he started losing interest. He did cheat on me, three times. I was stupid to keep on giving chances to him. He knew I was all his and maybe that's why he started taking me for granted. And that's when things got bad. I know I'm not a good person and I've done some things too but I'm sure I was all loyal.
He started getting abusive. 

Valentine's Day '14. I was 16. We lived 6 bus stops away and it took time to get to him. Traffic made it take even longer . When I got there he was pissed because I took so much time. He grabbed me by the arm and started calling me names i'd gotten used to at that point. We walked until we reached darker and empty streets. We didn't talk to each other. We held hands. His grip was tight, squeezing my fingers together. We reached a house that looked like it was empty. All the lights were out. It wasn't his house, just a random house. We went in through the gate and to the side of the house so that it hid us from the main road and from any neighbouring house. Basically we were hidden from the world.  He started kissing me hard. His hands were on my shoulders. I was pinned to the wall. I tried to move but he was heavier than me, even though he was as skinny as a stick. I was uncomfortable. I didn't kiss him back. He got pissed, called me a slut, said I was cheating on him. The usual. Then it came. The first slap. It was hard and sudden and unexpected. I didn't know what was happening. I was crying at that point. My mouth was shut with his hand. His other hand moved down. Kissing me on my neck Now, biting and sucking . I'd had enough I wanted to go home. I told him to stop. I'd had enough, I kept telling him to stop. He didn't. But I didn't stop.  He got irritated I guess or IDK. Came more slaps. And a final push to the wall. And he walked away.. 
I didn't know my way back home, my way to the bus stop that would take me home. I was alone. My heart was crying. I found my way back, went home. Texted him again and again apologizing. I thought he hated me I thought he'd break up. I couldn't bear that idea. I was in a bad place.

"A little background about myself:I have always been struggling with depression, anxiety and self-worth issue. It was not always like this, I remember a time, about 15 years back when I was a confident and energetic child. But over the past 15 years I have been hurt and bullied to the point where i have lose any confidence i have in myself and have zero-self worth. Often being an entertainment for others, I just feel like my life is destined to be an entertainment for others, always there to bring happiness and joy to others at the expense of getting hurt myself.

First forward I am 20 years old now and have attempted sucide about 3 times, each time I was stopped. A few months back, I met this girl who was really amazing and we started talking and got quite close as friends. A few months ago I asked her for the opportunity to woo her and she say she will consider after I have touched her, nonetheless we continue chatting and we got so close to the point that we actually planned an overseas trip together for Christmas.

Fast forward to the trip, it was amazing and I (we) had a blast, however, on the last day, things started to take a turn for the worst. Her reply started getting very cold and she blocked me from her social. As we were staying in separate hotels I attempted to commit sucide again, only to be stopped by my friend who called the hotel and got the general manager to came up and stop me. 

Fast forward a few days from that, her reply to my messages has been nothing but cold, distant and it takes her hours to reply and that is if she ever reply at all. I really wondered what I did wrong. I tried asking her but she told me it was nothing and that she was just busy. But unfortunately, this has totally destroyed what ever little self-confidence and drive I have left and I just feel that I have suddenly plunged into darkness.

After 4 failed attempts I realise I'm too much of a wimp to do anything directly resulting in ending my life. I just want to stop existing as well. Today is New Year eve and I really just feel like wanting to just OD on pills and just hope I would never wake up tomorrow. Since for the most part of my life, everyone has been treating me as entertainment, I feel by doing this, I can present a finale to everybody, show everyone behind the fake smile that I has put on for so long....my friend scolded me for being so pathetic to put my happiness and life in the control of a girl but  for the past few months, my focus was only on her and I really enjoyed her company. I really donât know what happened and I really donât wanna lost this friendship, it is really ok if we donât get together but I do not want to lose this friendship as well.

I am really lost, really sad and really distant...I really donât know what to do anymore other than just not exist since I feel like a disappointment to everybody (average student, not much achievements, generally a disappointment) I use feel like lying down tonight and never waking up tomorrow.",1,"been hurt and bullied to the point where i have lose any confidence,have zero-self worth,she blocked me from her social,After 4 failed attempts,just not exist, lying down tonight and never waking up tomorrow "

"I never had much friends throughout my life. Never really hang out or play tag when I was a kid. I was a obscure kid with your self-esteem. Occasionally got bullied, cried a little, didnât tell anyone and lived on with it. I have make some pretty good friends after I grew up, they were friends I could talk with. Weâre now working adults now and well, we drifted apart.
Iâm at my work, have no problem with social interaction and self-esteem anymore. I feel like my life have been a performance. I fake a smile to my colleagues, to my parents but I know that Iâm still that kid, wanting something more from life. I questioned myself have I ever been happy and no I have not. I feel like a failure in everything I do. Every step I take forward just spiral me deeper. I thought I could outgrow depression, but living into my late 20s, I donât think thats possible. Maybe I just hate myself, maybe I hate society for making me this way.
The only thing that is make my life worth living is entertainment that keep my mind from thinking about my depression, pushing me onwards till I finally die. ",1," Got bullied, Never had much friends, feel like a failure, just hate myself,"

"I am finally numb to it. And it feels good. It feels good to feel nothing instead of crying and just wishing to be dead, the mental agony Iâve experienced throughout my life is so very painful in a way I canât describe. Me sitting down calmly and wanting to die is a lot better than me crying and hurting myself because the âpainâ is so terrible. 

I canât escape him. I canât escape my father. His voice is in my head every time I donât do anything perfectly. When I look in the mirror. What he said about me mirrors how I think about myself still. 
I always end up dating men just like him. They make me feel crazy and emotionally and mentally abuse me to no end. The guy I thought I loved just told me yesterday that I should be happy that it took him âthis longâ to start pretending to throw heavy objects at me angrily.

The numbness is much better than the depression. Maybe Iâll get numb to the point where itâll be easy to kill myself instead of always chickening out. Thereâs nothing for me here. I am selfish and want just one thing: Love, and I canât get it. And Iâm not going to stay around waiting in pain and mental anguish until I die, just so other people can benefit off of my love and care. I want something for me for once.

I feel so alone and I think about dying almost every day. I wish I didnât. I feel like the sooner I end my life the better. But I canât bring myself to do it just yet. A tiny bit of me thinks that maybe I should wait, maybe I will get Lucky. But will the suffering be worth it. 

Maybe someone will find me with my wrists slit. Maybe someone will find me hung up in my closet. Maybe then people will understand. Because right now no one does. No one ever has. No matter how many attempts Iâve made to get people to notice Iâm hurting. I fantasize about my death sometimes. I know thatâs not normal. Hence one more reason why I should not be alive.

"I am 16M and a black male in a racist area in South Dakota. Whenever I'd make a friend as a little kid, their parents would shoo me away and tell their own kid I'm a criminal because I looked mean and dirty and my parents were. Even the Hispanic kids who get the same rap around here weren't allowed to talk to me. I wore the same clothes every day and rarely showered. It's the same problem as we have now. Technically we have running water and a shower, but it's so filthy and full of grime and backed up poo water that it's less disgusting to go without. I've been bullied and completely friendless since I was 11.

My parents have too high an income to qualify for social programs and spend all their money on drugs and eating out. They live like pigs and leave all their empties and hoarded things everywhere.

I know there are a lot of black people/poor people who have been successful and lived happy lives, but I am much different than them in that I am so easily broken. I am a shell of a person, and I developed epilepsy and another disability that limits my fine motor skills. I have seizures where I can't stop moving a limb repeatedly, lose consciousness for upwards of a minute, or both. It gets worse when I miss doses of medication. I have randomly vomited at times before being diagnosed and treated.

I stopped going to school when I was 14 because I had a seizure at school and pooped my pants. I am ""home schooled"". It doesn't matter if i have a diploma though when nobody wants to hire someone who could have seizures on work time. I'm going to just be on disability until I end it. Nobody cares about me and people who know me will be glad to have me gone.

I don't care if ""it gets better,"" and I won't call a suicide hotline. Please don't respond with clichÃ©s like that. I want you to tell me how to actually fix my life if you know how. If that doesn't work, I'll probably just end it because there is no point prolonging a useless life.",1,"black people,poor people, so easily broken,  criminal because I looked mean and dirty, been bullied and completely friendless, drugs ,  just end it because there is no point prolonging a useless life"
"This is on wikipedia, the page title is ""Social psychology"".

&gt;  The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.[18]:109 Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.[18]:111 Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).[20]

Lol, sorry, i should have explained what this shit means.

Realistic perception means you can understand both personal deffects and also situation ones, it just means you don't excuse yourself for your mistakes or wrong doings, but you also will not excuse anyone. You have higher moral standards. You see things for what they are. 

Happy people will fuck up today, rationalize their bullshit away in one sentence and completely forget about it. They say it's strenght but in reality is just ignoring.

"After having gained some optimism back and starting to be a bit more positive, here it comes again an ocean of sadness that waves over me. Thoughts circulating around my brain at what seems to be at light-speed.

It's crazy how you can think and feel this is by far the lowest point of my life, it can't get any lower, and then a lower point comes along sooner or later that makes you reflect ""wow how can this be lower then that time? ""How much lower can the human mind and heart tolerate before it caves in?"" 

I'm on my 4th. Honestly i'm actually impressed i'm still here somehow.

Of all my 30 years of living this is has been the most educational and informative year of life ever, the year that taught me all the truths of life and humanity.

Are humans completely selfish by design? Or is this a product of centuries of brainwash by society? Humans by nature are selfish and competitive but it's more of a survivor defense mechanism than anything, I think all the rest of the cruel values and selfishness that has been brainwashed into humanities minds and hearts is definitely a product of the masses. I especially know this since I use to be one of them, utterly brainwashed, hurting others never realizing it or the extent. But thankfully I always in the depths of my heart had that urge, that desire to be a better human being programmed into my heart even in the bigoted ways of my past.

Everybody lies, EVERYONE LIES. When I say that I don't mean 100% I mean 80% the majority who far outweigh the few people you can run into who are apart of that other 20%, meaning it's almost invisible. Even that neighbor with his kids, loving wife, who wakes at 5am everyday to drink his coffee and goes to work, who smiles at you when he sees you in the morning and asks ""how you are?"" and bids a ""good day"" to you is some selfish prick who believes, who teaches and preaches these terrible values to his family thinking it's normal, it's alright, ""we're the good ones"", ""we should be proud for being such upstanding citizens"" even that guy is a total selfish evil prick that goes blind to most of societies eyes.

I don't know how to live with myself anymore, I've tried for months to figure out a way to want to continue to live in what I know and feel.

How can I integrate back into society knowing how they treats others? The racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality, how they treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism, nationalism, religious discrimination, linguistic discrimination, neurological descrimination. How most women treat most men now, they're all evil. How transgender people treat cisgender people because ""they could never understand"" whelp they treated us this way so now ""stfu"" your cis you have no say you ""evil cis!"" It's nothing but hate one way or the other, even the person fighting for what's right is doing it by doing something so wrong, even if the person is good in your eyes there's something dark and fucked up about them.

I'm no saint but everyday I self-reflect, everyday I look at how I can improve as a human, I can do wrong and I can hurt, but I have the self-awareness to listen to my fellow human and learn from it and be better, to see my faults, where I can improve, because I can't stand the thought of a stranger hurting because I had something to do with it directly or indirectly.

Let's pollute, let's kill our planet, let's have plastic surgery for non-medical reasons, let's hurt animals, let's make MORE AND MORE AND MORE MONEY, let's bully in real life and on the internet, let's have privilege, let's eye for an eye, because if we suffered in the past I guess than those who oppressed should suffer now, even the innocent ones, so you're fucked if you're a man, or you're white, or you're Christian, or Jewish, or cisgender, or bisexual, or or or or or or. Let's not be educated, let's think we learned so much and enough, we shouldn't have to be taught better anymore, because ""we know better"".

Why is there so much risk to living a new day everyday even if you're mildly successful?

If I'm bisexual, my sexuality will probably get dismissed left and right all day.

If i'm gay I better not be somewhere like Lithuania.

If i'm transgender, well i'll have to look over my shoulder and fear for my life 68% of the time while never being taken seriously as my gender.

If i'm cisgender, well you better get use to the fact you're ""evil"" because I guess I had a conventional upbringing.

If i'm religious, well that's all hocus pocus now, you're beliefs are secondary to mines!

If you're unattractive, best get use to the idea you'll never get taken completely seriously, you'll have to work and prove yourself 20 times more to other people and probably still not get as good as a opportunity.

If you're a woman, hope you love that unequal salary and being slut-shammed for wearing a skirt or shorts one size too small and tight.

If you're shorter than 5'7, good luck in the dating world, HA good luck getting that job because statistically taller people are hired more and valued more.

If you have tattoos, get ready for those stereotypes and awkward looks of judgement.

If you're ""fat"", GUESS WHAT YOU'RE LAZY.

If you're too skinny, remember women love fits guys and men love voluptuous ladies!

If you're not making at least 100K, might as well die, you're like that crap that went on clearance at a dollar store nobody wants and will go salvage.

If you're bi-polar, have ptsd, depressed, on the spectrum and many of the other frequent and normal neurological conditions everyone suffers normally daily in society, all those immensely gorgeous models, those intellectually genius people, all those successful and wealthy people who have those conditions, no one bats an eye to them, because if you have an issue and your worth doesn't translate to instant money, well you're just a fucked up person, a waste. 

Doesn't matter if you came from a violent background, homelessness, starvation, pain, a violent family, a history of prejudice. The older you are the more you better have your shit together! Because money, looks, degrees, that shit is just handed to you like bubblegum from a candy dispenser apparently.

Fuck you for telling me it'll get better, you mean if I somehow manage another week, or year, or 2 or 3 without fucking completely losing it mentally and going insane or offing myself because that's how psychological distress works, it gets the best of you.

It'll get better alright, when a gosh damn existential miracle happens that magically makes most people not shit even when they're ""good people"" who ""mean well"", when i'm not oppressed every damn waking second because I had no freaking say in my birth!

EAT IT BITCH SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. Thank you humanity you have passed a beautiful legacy to our society. The hippies of back then had it all right, peace and love all ya'll. But those hippies were just a bunch of potheaded wastebags and their little mantra didn't translate to selfishness and money.

Thank you so much.",1," treats others,racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality,  treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism,discrimination"
I've felt like a social outcast for as long as I can remember. I've always felt like everyone else is constantly running around going to parties and hanging out with each other.

"I know tonight is supposed to be a good one but I'm having a hard time shaking the thoughts of just pulling the plug. The thought of going through yet another year in poverty, loneliness, hatred and sadness is almost too much for me to bear.

I'm 23 years old, I've never had a girlfriend, I've barely had any sex to speak of, I work minimum wage shitty jobs, I have no friends, no family to speak of, and no young woman even close to my age seems to want anything to do with me. I get degraded by other men for not having had enough sex, not seeming masculine enough, and while I understand men are supposed to be strong, few people understand that men have feelings too.

It's like my life is some nightmare I can't wake up from. I look young for my age, and while I've been through so much and so many difficult experiences, people only see an 18 year old kid when they look at me. Girls assume I am naive and immature and look the other way, guys assume I'm a pussy. I get nothing, because apparently I am nothing, at least to the naked eye.

"I'm laying in bed and thinking about what a fucked up year I've had. Seriously, what a fucking shit show. Years of depression and other mental illnesses finally caught up to me. Like it beat the shit out of me. I put an end to something fucked up that I did but the damage is still there and not completely cleared because I don't know how to approach the situation because I'm fucking mentally fucked up and I don't even know how to explain that to someone. I spent days in bed, crying, paranoid walking around outside thinking people know all my secrets and all thats wrong with me. I've spent days being yelled at by my parent, being a second parent to my little sibling and still being told that I do nothing. That I don't give. Being emotionally and verbally abused by my sister. Letting guilt numb me till I can't feel anymore. Hating myself on top of hating myself, to the point where I want to rip myself apart whenever I see my reflection. 21 years and I have no fucking friends. I feel like the biggest piece of shit. I don't know who I am, all I know is that I'm depressed and have issues of identity, gender, personality, and traumatic experiences that fucking haunt me. Every time I told myself to go seek help I failed. Every time I tried to have a good day I came back to my room and cried till nothing came out anymore. It was a fucking shitty year. I don't see anything changing in the new year. Don't even know if I'll make it through. Tough shit. I pray every day that I die because I don't have the courage to do it myself.

"Hi there, I'm here really just looking for some help, not for me specifically, but for a friend, or maybe help for me on how to help her. Warning, this is going to be kinda long.

Freshman year of college, I met an amazing girl in my major. Smart, outgoing, an athlete, and she subscribed to my quirky/dark humor. We actually hooked up pretty much right after meeting, I thought I was in love. We fooled around for most of freshman year, I thought things were going great.

Turns out things were not going great. I always felt something was kind of off with her, she would always get this vacant look in her eyes whenever we were fooling around, she was like a different person. As it turns out, she was assaulted in high school, and it really messed with her. She basically lost the ability to say ""no"" but at the same time hated herself for it, she she shut herself away while things happened and then dealt with the personal fallout later. She finally just kinda swore off sex at the beginning of sophomore year. That was her band-aid. I fear she's still fighting a losing battle though.

She isn't sleeping well, she's hiding away from people more and more every day. She gets mad at me for trying to get too close. She's scared to let herself have any fun, to go out and party because she's afraid that she'll fall back into old habits, and she can't afford to do that anymore. She has pretty vivid nightmares regularly. I've witnessed one, they're fucking awful. I didn't want to touch her and influence her dream, but I had to keep her from thrashing into desks. Lose-Lose situation.

She says she's smart enough that she knows suicide isn't the answer for her, but I know she has lapses in judgement, I know she has made attempts in the past, or at least plans for attempts. I'm just afraid everything is just going to get worse, that shes going to keep having these lapses and shes going to get closer and closer.

I just want some help, some advice. I want to know how to make sure I don't lose one of the few people in this world I truly care about. I wonder if any of you have been in similar situations, either mine or her's, and what kinds of steps you have taken.

I was supposed to go all out senior year. I wanted to have the greatest âlastâ summer break, I wanted to carve pumpkins for Halloween and go to a haunted house. I wanted to have a FriendsGiving and I wanted to make a gingerbread house. I wanted to go to a crazy New Years party and count down to 2018. But nobody ever thinks of inviting me because Iâm at best a second tier friend to every person I know.

"That's right folks, the second part to something no one asked for or even responded to. I don't think I'm going to stop just yet, though. Maybe I just want some attention. Or maybe I want people to know who I am. Maybe I'm just so hurt right now that I'll do anything just to be seen. Just to be spoken to. I am so very alone, and unwanted.

I am a broken man, and these are the attempts I made to become better for the woman I love, the woman I am no longer with.

Between the last part and this one, my therapist and I established a history of medications and treatment, and whatnot. When we got back into the real issues, it went as follows;

&gt; Hello /////-

&gt; Thanks for sharing information related to your medical and mental health history. It is evident that you are being intentional about being open about your history , symptoms and experiences. Please remember that being open and willing to work through things that are blocking your current progress and ""fueling"" ongoing mood symptoms and making interpersonal functioning difficult is KEY to reducing your symptoms and rebuilding your life. It is important to get this information so that together we can get a clearer understanding of your past and current history. This will be very useful when we meet on Thursday as we review the therapeutic process and begin to start setting goals.

&gt; /////- I am sorry to hear that you experienced years of sexual abuse . You are definitely a survivor and a man of courage. In our society the trauma that men experience is sometimes swept under the rug, without any acknowledgement. You won't find that here. ALL of who you are and what you have experienced is welcome in this space and vital to your healing . Self knowledge and awareness is the basis of all knowledge . I am glad you took a chance by sharing something so personal. I can't imagine trying to deal with all of the thoughts, emotions and isolation this has brought into your life .

&gt; You know, I can't help but wonder how this trauma impacted your view of yourself, others , the world and your place in it. Have you ever talked about this part of your life experiences with anyone else ? Does your family or partner have any clue about all that you have been through ? You mentioned having siblings . Please tell me more about your relationship with them .

&gt; This is YOUR time for healing and renewal . No need to thank me for my time. You reached out for help and with a desire to learn how to grow into a better version of yourself and you are worth it!! Continue to believe in yourself by remaining open , speak your truth !! The possibilities are endless!


*If you need any other information regarding those things, let me know.*

*As for how this has affected my views, well. Most of them are not good, except when they are. At my best, I would consider myself an optimistic nihilist. At my worst, I wouldn't know. My view on myself is that I am pointless, worthless, a failure, important to no one in any meaningful way, and completely incapable of doing anything I would enjoy in life, much less anything productive or helpful to others. Except for the times it isn't, where I can acknowledge and even enjoy my strong suits. People actively seek to befriend me and I have had strong relationships.*
*I am aware that I have value to myself and others, and even sometimes enjoy what few things I've done for myself. I've seen some interesting things, been to some interesting places. My opinions and views on literally everything shift from moment to moment, or mood to mood. Life and the world we live in is equaled in beauty only by it's brutality. Fair in its unfairness, harmonious in its discord. In life, one man may experience heaven and for it another man will experience hell. In the end, we are all the same life, being lived out through different circumstances.*

*How I feel largely dictates how I see everything in that particular moment. Sometimes it's balanced and calm, many times it is bitter and indignant. My place in this life it is mine to chose, but there is nothing I have considered that has moved me to the point of choosing to do it. Nothing about myself matters enough that I would ever do anything to better my situation or make my own life one that I would be proud to have lived. Even this may be an attempt to better myself, but it is not FOR myself. I'm doing it because I want to make someone else happier without losing them, to be better FOR THEM, not for me. I do not care about myself.*

*I have only rarely mentioned these things to people. My family knows, but, that's about it. I have told the current woman I am in a relationship with of some of my history, including the abuse, but certainly not most of it. Certainly not the experiences with drugs or some of the worse things I've seen, and done.*

*The relationship with my siblings is strained, at best. I have no idea where to even begin. I grew up with two brothers. One older by a year, one younger by a year. Our path from childhood to adulthood was spent making attempts to murder or inflict serious injury on each other, interspersed with brief moments of kinship. I can honestly say that I have very few, almost zero, good memories of either of them to this day, None of us had doors to our rooms because we kept destroying them, breaking them down each time one of us would start a fight and then run away.*

*There was an occasion I recall where an uncle of ours entered onto an altercation where I had a knife to the throat of my younger brother because he had antagonized me to the point of nearly killing him, meanwhile he laughed uncontrollably having been pleased with himself for doing so. He had once put rusty nails and screws into eggfoam outside my room and caused me to have over fifteen holes in my left foot when I stepped on it not thinking there would be anything in it. The older brother had a bunch of douchebag friends who themselves were basically bullies and awful to be around, and he himself was extremely violent. He was a Juggalo for a good portion of his teen years, if that explains anything.*

*I spent most of my life just trying to avoid the two of them. Hard to do without doors sometimes. I can list our literally hundreds of instances where we were all shitty human beings to each other and those around us. As of typing this, the two of them have had a fight where my younger was knocked unconscious, and beaten, sustaining a possible permanent injury to one of his ankles. I do not know if they'll ever speak again. And I've told both that I don't want to be a part of their shit.*

*When we were older, things got better. But all three of us have always been belligerant about whats been done in the past, and none of us really get along well for long periods of time. A few hours is usually my threshold before I need to be away from them. They can occasionally be good company, but, mostly not.*

*I think that's enough text for this one. I will say, I do not have faith in myself. I do not believe in myself. If I did, I would have done a lot more than I have. I wouldn't be failing every time I make an attempt to find some kind of happiness.*",1,"sexual abuse, trauma"
"I was with a group of friends last night, and another friend started talking to another friend about how many girls secretly liked him and stuff. It was crazy, because no one has ever talked to me about things like that. Then, on the way to the pub, a group of girls basically called me unattractive. Funny how girls are never shy about calling me ugly, but they're apparently too shy to ""approach me"". I never get signals, I've had shit luck on dating sites, no one ever approaches me, no one has ever had a crush on me, and my family are the only people that call me handsome. Nothing tells me that I'm ugly based on how girls treat me versus how they treat other guys.

"I never dreamt it could have lasted this long. It feels like every moment the feelings abate are really only a brief reprieve, the returning torment tears into my psyche with even less remourse. The corruption grows ever inside me, sometimes sleeping only to awake at times it needs to destroy.

The point of trauma feels so far away in time, nearly four years. When the episodes occur, it only feels as it happened just seconds prior. I have no physical ailments, only desolation of the mind. I haven't found an environment for healing, and I don't think I ever will. Isolation is sporadically maddening, not knowing if I'm truly losing my sanity or just feeling the pangs of past wrongdoings. Social circumstances are not helpful to the source of pain, when the episodes occur, all others can sense the turmoil and recoil at the possibility of backlash from this force.

It is a malevolent manifestation of my reality. All manner of action: speech, observation, hearing, all the surroundings are contorted to keep me bound to its dark will. None can even attempt to wrest control of the power it wields, its strength is insurmountable. I'm but a prisoner to its will, the slightest misstep in my path through life it sees an opportunity to grow and infest more within the spirit.

I feel as undeserving to face a plight so dire. It only exists when it feels the possibility to arise. I feel as though an instrument or vessel of its ill conceit. I look into a mirror to see a fair face staring back, crystal blue eyes, a symmetryÂ  throughout; many smiles from others abound me in my days, and I feel yet obligated to receive this blessing. My looks yet deceive my emotion, for I know a disgusted figure is writhing within. I cannot tell what yet be unattractive to most: a physical flaw or a scarring of the soul that only seeks to rend into another. I won't let my fellow man that deserve peace be upended in their stable life by a force so reckless.

So I reserve myself, keeping this force of trauma at bay from others, while enduring the suffering of its imprisonment. If love could break its chains that bind itself to me and I to it; it has not yet been gifted from those that radiate beauty throughout, or even a divine power to ease my pain. Society has disillusioned me of the agony I face. I am aware of flaws of the human nature that are best left ignored. Faced against this foe forces my consciousness to the dark reality.

I only wish I had an answer or remedy to this trouble, I fear that none may be found.",1,"Unattractive to most, physical flaw, agony, aware of flaws, best left ignored"
"I was a quiet weird child who couldn't talk to other kids. My friends were just bullies who abused my kindness and lack of courage. I spent my childhood online because everything was nicer and funner there. So of course i have no friends now and I dont know how to interact with people normally. Being truly alone is more painful and impactful than imaginable for most. I am now bitter and fed up with myself and everyone. I don't enjoy anything anymore, I cant do anything at all without feeling terrible. I cant think anymore my mind is blank I want to take a sledge hammer to my head just to see what's in there. Thatd be stupid though. I don't see a future for myself. I wish it didn't all happen like this, I feel like I never had a chance. abused in childhood never loved by anyone and jealous of everyone who isn't grateful that they're loved and appreciated. My mind is gone, any chances I had are gone at this point, socially I will never be successful and so what's the point? Youre depressed yeah just tell your friends and family they love you and want you happy! My family wont help me I dont have the means to help myself. My brain is fucking mush. What a world huh

"I made another post here before but I deleted it out of nervousness. This'll be my second one. Hope it's okay.

I have felt the worst pain ever due to hating my body. It is a great weight that just burdens me every day. I make it part of my life to protect other people from the repulsiveness. I don't wear anything that's supposed to compliment my body, because quite frankly, it just does the opposite. I could go into so much detail about everything. I hate my face and I hate my body. It is this horrible weight, this impending shame. The only thing I can describe it as is...shame. Horrible, horrible shame. 

I don't even hate my body, I hate what I did to it. I hate myself for abusing my body. It works so hard to keep me alive and I've destroyed it. I hate sitting down because then I feel the fat. I hate feeling my stomach touch my shirt because it reminds me that it protrudes even when I suck it in. I hate that my body's imbalanced, because of course, I was blessed with the small boobs that ABSOLUTELY NO ONE in my family has but me. I'm 50 pounds overweight and I have absolutely nothing. My doctor tells me it's okay (despite the BMI saying I'm obese). She tells me that I'm still in a safe range. My heart isn't in danger and nor is my body. That's a relief, but I still don't feel good.

I feel it's my duty to protect the world from my appearance. I don't want to subject anyone to what I have to see. I know people say that other people aren't looking and don't care, but that doesn't matter to me. I would never want myself looking like how I do in public. I don't wear anything that hugs my body. Some take it as ""modest"", and while I do aim to be modest, it's not because of that. I hate moving and getting out of bed and just talking because of it. I just want to hide from the world and stay in a box of shame and guilt. I hate feeling my stomach exist. I hate my stomach protruding. I hate how clothes cut my body fat in half. I call it the 3 phenomenon because it looks like the shape of 3 from a side view. That's the worst feeling to me. That's what always reminds me. I hate going outside and going into public because of it. I hate looking into the mirror. All I see is a ""sack of pig's flesh"", as I've named it. That phrase seems to be the only one that really captures the repulsiveness, disgust, and shame I feel.

I've dreamed of throwing up multiple times. But I know the dangers. I know it destroys your esophagus permanently. But I still want to fix it. I haven't done anything though. I may never do anything about it, regarding dangerous and reckless actions like throwing up. I know it won't ever be truly fixed, because as soon as I get skinny, then I won't have any good attributes. I don't know how I'll ever find a partner without anything appealing or pretty, because I've already cut the pool down to nearly nothing by waiting till marriage and being cyberschooled/being an absolute hermit. Not to mention also being a huge bitch.

I have tried so many times and I give up because I have no self control. I really think I need to be babysat on my diet. I need someone to keep an eye on me till I'm normal, and then get training to help keep a good lifestyle. I have no willpower. All I have is fear and sadness. Even that doesn't motivate me. I have no energy to be motivated. I've disappointed myself so much. I am a disappointment. I am a failure in so many regards and I am so mad at myself for everything. I live in shame. I have to constantly stare at this ugly sack of pig's flesh. It's caused me so much sadness. I don't want to do anything anymore because it just fills me with sadness adn shame. I don't want to stop existing. I just want to hide. Hide so others don't have to see it. No one has told me my body's beautiful. People just say ""you're not fat"" and I know damn right they're lying. They do that after I start whining and crying. Only then will they reassure me, and I know that's to shut me up. No one has ever actually told me I'm appealing. People have only told me my face is beautiful when I have makeup on. Once boys see me without makeup they stop talking to me (But that may also be cause I'm overbearing and kinda weird).

I don't even know if I should post this. I may actually delete this. Sorry if it's too long. Also, sorry if it sounds narcissistic or vain. I'm not looking for compliments.

"Hi all.

Not sure this is the right place for this; I submitted it on r/suicidewatch but there's so many threads on there I fear I won't get any replies.  I need some help and i'm scared to call a suicide hotline for fear of them staging an intervention or some such thing.

This is a first for me -- I've had moments in my life where i've felt close to the edge but things have been really hard recently.

I'll cut to the chase here.

Three years ago I suffered a workplace accident and broke my L3-l4 vertebrae, in addition to my hip. I sustained mid back complications as well that have caused heavy spasms and contusions. I've been fighting workers' comp for all three of these years to get treatment. I got my spine fused two years ago and my hip a little less than a year ago -- while things are better, to the extent that I can walk and such, I live in constant pain and discomfort. I still need to ice my lower and middle back constantly. I recently successfully applied and got invited to my dream job in the Peace Corps, but when I got to medical clearance they told me I couldn't handle the job. This has left me devastated. I thought I could beat this thing through sheer force of will, but my plans have crumbled to nothing and I don't know what to do.

Moreover, I was molested at a Christian summer camp when I was 11 years old and i have never been able to move past it. It has completely impaired my ability to form emotional attachments and even to perform sexually -- not necessarily all the time, but enough that i have blown every chance I've had at romantic normality or happiness. I fear it's messed me up beyond repair.

I am now 25 and tottering under the weight of these burdens. While in the past i've had an active and enjoyable social life and great/varied friends, a mixture of chronic pain and my own personality defects led to me having a very lonely ahd depressing New Year's -- a massive contrast from only a year ago, when I had a pretty damn good time.

The holiday isn't the cause, of course -- it's more just the catalyst to underlying issues I can't seem to beat.

I am lonely. I am in pain. I want desperately to live a normal life but I no longer believe it is possible.

Is there anyone out there who has beaten something like this? What the hell do I do? Where do I turn? How do I overcome this? Is it even worth it? I just want it all to stop.

I would appreciate any advice. I really would. I need 2018 to be different, and I fear it will not be.",1,"Molested, never been able to move past, impaired my ability, to form emotional attachments, even to perform sexually, workplace accident, couldn't handle the job, Lonely, in pain"
"Within the last month, she has lost her best friend and her grandmother, who she was very close with (both passed away). This time last year, she was involved in an incident where she was assaulted (we were not dating at the time), and it is bringing up some bad memories for her. She is continuously mentioning about moving cities on her own, and she keeps insisting she is fine. I'm the only support she has, please help !",1,"was assaulted, bad memories, lost her best friend, her grandmother, both passed away"
"When I was a kid, I was severely bullied. Be we realized why, but I suppose because I could not defend myself and did respond to them with stupid answers, they would target me. When I was in high school, I had 2 friends who were exclusively school friends. They did not care to hang out of school and once school was over, we never saw each other again.

Now years later. Same story. I am not being bullied but people like to talk crap which is inevitable. So I invested time and money in this class. I was traveling somewhere far for it, my classmates were all friendly to me and joking around. Added each other on social media. This class happened to be a short-term one since the teacher was quitting. I thought these people would get close to me and since we were getting along, that they would like to keep in touch. So NOTHING! Again same story as back in high school. I happened to like this guy who did not like me in return and did things to hurt me such as not inviting me to the farewell class party or not asking me to get involved with projects out of class. Then they like each other's pictures on social media but not mine. Then I see some of them coming to my city to visit but they do not care to meet me and hang out.

So why people bother and act so friendly in class but not out of? Is it that they just want to be on good terms and earn something? Why go and act that me and them are friends and we can hang out but when I ask they are all busy? I admit I seemed a little needy. I did not put effort back in school to make friends but this time I did. I was polite, I did ask them about their goals, tried to be around and active, liked their posts on social media. Only thing is that I had a fight with the guy I liked and everyone liked him in class, so most likely he spoke nonsense. 

I just feel very disappointed. Any advice?",1,"Bullied, did things to hurt, not inviting me to the farewell class party disappointed"
"It sucks because a flaw about your personality can easily be fixed and I doubt it has a strong impact. Being reminded constantly of body flaws is the worse in my opinion because that can just ruin someone completely. It just hits you in the heart because that's what everyone views you as. What sucks even more is that, you can be confident in your own skin and as soon as someone points out a flaw, that thought stays with you forever and will never escape your mind.

"I'm not talking about our misconstrued constructs about what's morally acceptable. I'm talking about the hypocrisy and the pretentiousness, the megalomania that grips each and every person. I mean, everyone is so full of shit. We pretend to care about others, and want others to care about us, but it's not because we actually care. It's because we're the only thing that matters. As soon as it becomes convenient, we throw others to the side. So long as we can get our chemical fix, we'll slave away until the day we die, spouting bullshit and pretending as if things actually matter. Hell, we even have the ego to assume we have some kind of superiority over other living creatures. Are we not animals? Sorry, but just because we are subjectively more intelligent, doesn't mean our existence is any less futile or has any more meaning. Sorry to break it to you, but God's not real, and why would you even want him to be? (i may be inserting my preconceived notions as fact, but in theme with this post, Idgaf if you disagree) 
     On this subreddit, we all pretend to sympathize with each other, but I bet in real life we are all judgemental sacks of shit, and I'm willing to bet that because I know I certainly am. I like to spout about the woes of man, but in real life, I'm a slave to the emotional parts of my brain, an introvert with no social skills, humor, or personality. I don't explain this for pity btw, I explain this because I'm quite the hypocrite, and I'm willing to bet you are too. People who complain about gender inequality annoy me. People who complain about racial inequality annoy me. I'm a selfish prick, sure. But so are you. So stop forcing me to pretend to care about you? I have my own worthless ideals that I care about, and that you don't. For example, I think there is a ridiculous age inequality. For what reason should age be used as an indicator of expected respect? If you're a fucking idiot, and don't cater to my selfish wants, I'm not going to fucking respect you. I might be *age* and a know it all, but that doesn't guarantee I don't fucking know more than you. Even if I don't, everyone shouldn't just assume I don't and treat me like a fucking child, but then expect me to act like an adult. Are you fucking kidding me with the hypocrisy?
Oh, but even though you don't take my issue seriously, I should take racism seriously because it affects you personally and you would like to feed your ego.


I wasted enough time venting for no reason. Time to go waste my time working after staying up late for no reason. I don't really know what the point of this post was, but I feel like there was a general theme to it.

"For the past few years I've been feeling more and more miserable and depressed and I don't know why.

Things that used to make me happy now just leave me feeling empty. I think my last truly happy day was my wedding day 1.5 years ago, which isn't great for a 28 year old guy I guess.

I think the speed at which things feel like they are getting worse seems to increase which each ""episode"", if you can call it that, where I normally have some kind of break down.

I feel like I'm trapped inside my own head, even though I know I should do something, or sometimes even want to do something I just can't. I'm telling myself to get up of the couch and do those things, but my body just doesn't seem to respond. Instead I just sit there and accomplish nothing.

I used to be so much more positive, I completely changed my career in retail to be a web developer and worked my way up to be in charge of my own team. I always fought my way through the pressure and got really far in my career at a young age and then at some point this all started.

Food is a side affect as well as a cause of a lot of my problems. As I'm so unable to get the motivation to do anything, I normally just order takeout rather than cooking food. Which in turn just makes me feel more guilty and the cycle continues.

It's strange, I image if you asked anybody that I work with or any of the few friends that I have they probably all think I'm a happy, outgoing person. The only person who knows is my wife and even then I'm not sure she knows the extent of how I feel. I also don't want to put extra pressure on her as she has dealt with depression before as well. She eventually went to her GP and they gave her some medication that has definitely made a difference to her outlook on life.

This was a while ago but it made me think that maybe I could get up the willpower to go to the doctors and see if they could help me. This morning I made an appointment with the doctor and I thought things might be looking up, but it didn't take long for things to come crashing down to an all time low.

When I got there they said they had been trying to call me all morning because they had to cancel my appointment since the doctor hadn't turned up. Annoying as it may be this should a reasonable excuse. Instead, I could feel myself stood at reception falling apart inside.

Every now and then I've had thoughts like ""Would things be better if I weren't here"" and afterwards I always said to myself that even though I'd thought it I'd never do something like that.

As I was walking home from the doctors, probably about 20 feet from my street where I had to cross over, it hit me. I was considering just walking straight into the road and I didn't even care. I was actually disappointed when I got to the edge of the path and there weren't any cars coming.

I got in the house and had a massive panic attack, I couldn't breath, then I was probably the most angry I've ever been and throwing things about and screaming at things. I didn't know if I was more annoying at myself for wanting to do it, or for not actually doing it.

I've calmed down a bit now and I've apparently got an emergency appointment with a different GP but all of this only happened about an hour ago and I just don't know how to feel or what to do anymore.

"Turns out no self-esteem for years really ruins your life. Due to this I developed major and chronic depression. Know exactly what I need to do, can't do it.

You don't just rebuild self-esteem over days, weeks, months, or even years. This takes decades. 

Decades of kindness, decades of acceptance, decades of love. It's real hard to get that as someone who feels like every breath is robbing another of oxygen.

Pretty sure it's game over for my mental health. Oh well. Maybe I can learn to live without these things but 4+ years of trying make me weary, y'know.

"I'm 30 and have been depressed since 15, the age at which I realized I wasn't going to be tall and handsome and gave up on life. I get worse whenever I see porn, since I chastise myself for not having the genetics to date and bang hot women. I asked an aesthetics forum to rate pictures of me, they said 6-7, but it means almost nothing to me if it's not 9.

The one thing that keeps me from killing myself is thinking about how I could change my life around. I'm currently selling my stuff so I can afford lasik, then braces to fix my teeth. I'd also love to get limb lengthening on my legs by 3"" to make me about 6', but I have a small head and worry that I won't look good. I've done research on how to apply for gene therapy clinical trials and other radical reconstruction. I honestly don't care what the complications would be, I'm THAT unhappy. I think about suicide already, and I would end it if it happened to not work out.

I wasted a lot of time before realizing this ""my way or bust"" mindset, and I hope anyone younger than me can take away that you'll regret not solving your problems sooner if you don't start now.

"Apologies for the lengthy post..
**A brief about me:**
*Personal*:I am 25 yo male,gay,was molested by a few guys at different times.I  have low self-esteem about my physique(dark toned,thin with glasses).I have dental fluorosis(dark yellowish teeth), so I never smiled or laughed with my mouth open.Became sort of addicted to porn,hookups between August 2016-May,2017-had poor performance in career. Did shitty things like cruising at public toilets/groping at busses,etc.. since 2013 at various times.
Even through all these confusions, I am quite social now with all the fellow interns. 
I never shared any of my problems because, no body gives a shit and they might take it as a way to tease me. I hate small talk/sharing of facts/any talk about movies.I usually am silent if I went for a group dinner. I find it pretty hard to talk in group,also, I do not remember such facts about which country has X resources/so on.

*Career*:Finished Masters in Engineering with above avg GPA. Got a job through campus.Now, doing a research Internship and planning for PhD.
**About current work:**In my present internship, I was given a development project which I was not interested at all.Every others were given some interesting research work.I could have finished mine earlier and switched to something else, but I am dragging the work for so longgggggg. In every weekly meeting, I just lie to the Prof. that I did something something.All the other interns have detailed slides of their past week's work, but I write it in 1 or 2 lines. So, I am the worst performing guy in the Lab(I have the potential, but the project is dull and in this period, I came to a good understanding of my behavior,sexuality,addictions and so on.Now I am on track-No hookups,no Fap,no addiction to porn).I was also addicted to chess--played for 4-5 hours straight daily while others were seriously working on their projects.

**What happened:** This New Year, I was not invited for a jungle camping which every other lab mates went.Around 10+ people went.I used to talk with everyone whenever I meet.Even I asked a guy, the day before what was his plan for New year, he said he is just gonna stay in room. Few days back, they didn't invite me for a dinner too.

I do not know what has caused them to ignore me. Most of them are from well-to-do family, but mine is still kind of unstable with debts.So, I never eat costlier outside food and wear same clothes again and again and never go out for watching movies/party. I am in the city for 4 years and have been to a few places every now and then alone and am not interested to go out nowadays.I went for a cycle ride 2 weeks back with one other girl intern without informing anyone.

**How I felt that day?**
I was pretty irritated. They gathered outside my room discussing with my roommate,before leaving for the party.My roommate too didn't invite me either.The next few hours, I was thinking what I did wrong? why they left me alone? Why that guy lied? and this affected my normal day-day activities.I took longer time than usual in everything. I relapsed to chatting with strangers for hookups and jerked off after 25+ days of NoFap. I spent around 9 hours watching porn/porn images/chat with strangers.

**How do I feel now?**
* I know God has different plans for me and this party/get together is not for me.
* I am gonna stop talking with everyone except the close ones and prove my worth by achieving a level higher than all those people.
* I started my 2018 pretty good, with some self reflection and new thoughts for my PhD admission. I am kind of between introvert and extrovert, so my room was the ideal place for me anytime.
*I set out a few goals for 2018 and I am on track.I have read 30 pages yesterday and continuing.Target: 100 books in 2018.
*I didn't drink or eat crazy and have a good start.

Though, everything is fine with me now,I would like to know any similar experiences and how people dealt with this. I am okay with not going for the party(bcoz, I would not have enjoyed as much as staying alone),but I could not handle the lie and the fact that everybody took great efforts to conceal this from me.

"Iâve been having lucid dreams due to the side effects of my meds and Iâm finding it hard to cope with them. I talked to my doctor and he told me to try taking them in the morning instead of at night but that hasnât really helped.

I also asked him for sleeping pills and they didnât help either. In fact, they made things worse as I woke up right after from a nightmare and I found myself grabbing onto the bedsheets like I was grabbing onto something from my dream. I donât remember what it was but it was the first and last time I took them.

Going to sleep is no longer the comfort it once was. Even though I get plenty of sleep I wake up feeling mentally drained, and because these lucid dreams make it seems like I was awake and dealing with real life situations that tend to be stressful and unpleasant itâs like I wasnât really asleep. Physically Iâm well rested but mentally Iâm not. Idk if that makes sense but I feel like Iâm going crazy because in my dreams I sometimes âwake upâ and think everything is normal but then previous events from the dream come back and itâs so confusing. Then when I really wake up it takes me a minute to actually realize it was all just a dream and itâs messed up. 

I told my doc and he said most of the antidepressants have similar side effects and thatâs kinda made me miserable. I donât wanna trade my sanity just to stop being depressed.

"     You know when that feeling of disappointment when you discover that santa wasn't real and it was just your parents all along? I can't help but feel like that has been my whole life up until now.

     My life seemed just perfect until middle school. I was an optimistic social butterfly with a family that had a decent paycheck. At that time, it seemed like everything was placed perfectly and my life was the envy of others.

      When I made it to middle school, everyone would point out how ""black"" i was (My family is all white, and i happen to be slightly darker than all of them with some really coarse hair). I would tell my mother about how upset it made me, and she would reassure me that I had nothing to worry about. She said that I was slightly darker because she drank lot's of pepsi when she was pregnant (this doesn't sound rediculous when you're 13). By this point everyone at my school thinks I've gone mad or that I'm truly in denial about my skin. I wasn't, I was telling them genuinely what I thought was true. 

     When i turned 14, my parents got into a pretty hairy argument that was pretty normal at the time. My mom would be upset that my dad caught one of her lies, and she would make herself seem like the victim. My dad was pissed that she could easily make everyone feel so sorry for her (even if she was in the wrong), and he looked me straight in the eye and told me ""I'm not your real father"". I never cry... ever. But when the man tgat raised you you're entire life can just flick you off his shoulder like that. That... shit... destroyed... me.

     Turns out, my mother cheated on father she was dating my father for 5 years, and she accidentally conceived me. She tried to keep it a secret from the family and even my father.... and idk how, but she managed to keep everyone fooled. According to my cousins, aunts, and uncles, everyone already knew. She told the ENTIRE family to keep the truth from me.

    While i was in school, I couldn't look anyone in the eye. Not because i was mixed, but because I spent 2 years trying to convince everyone i was white. After this whole situation, there were two different kinds of people at my school. People that could capitalize on my misery, and the people that would sympathize me. Both of these kind of people disgust me.

     I'm 22 now and i moved out of my mothers home and now I really feel hopeless. I don't have a lot of friends, I don't feel as if I can trust anyone really. I hate the feeling of being manipulated, but i also hate the feeling of being alone. I'm beyond confused and idk how to fix myself.

TL:DR - My mother cheated on my father and I'm a result of it. I wasn't told that my father wasn't my biological father until i was 14 and it's a curse that wont go away",1,"middle school, everyone would point out how """"black"""" i was (My family is all white, and i happen to be slightly darker,would tell my mother about how upset it made me,She said that I was slightly darker because she drank lot's of pepsi when she was pregnant, truly in denial about my skin,my mother cheated on father,she accidentally conceived me"
"I mean, it's fucking awful man, I remember I used to help people left an right, and now, I don't know, I make people cry for no good reason, I feel fucking awful, I know that I shouldn't be so mean to everyone, I know that they're only trying to help, but I only know it afterwards, I only understand afterwards that I was a huge asshole, but never in the moment, and I hate it.


The feeling doesn't even stay, I make someone cry, then apologize for it because I start to understand what I'm doing, and then the next day I'm confused why I apologized, and rinse and repeat. 


The only time I feel somewhat normal is after being angry and making someone cry, because afterwards, I just can't think, my head is empty, and, it's somewhat peaceful, I don't know


I remember being there for everyone when they needed help, but now? Before they didn't even have to ask for help, I'd see it, but now? I couldn't care less about anything or anyone for that matter


Am I alone on this?",1,"I make people cry for no good reason, I feel fucking awful, I know that I shouldn't be so mean to everyone"

I told a guy who I thought was my friend something personal. It wasnât too deep but something anyone with half a brain should know not to share. I told my âfriendâ not to share it. I only told him something personal because he wanted to know more about me. So I opened up. But I also told him not to tell people about my family. I thought he was cool and we were friends for a couple weeks. I was new to making friends after deciding to open out of my shell. But now that this asshole tells people lies and rumors about me it just broke me. He tried texting me saying he didnât say anything but obviously Iâm not that stupid. This seriously just broke me down. I hate people who use me for company. I just canât trust anyone or make friends. Now the school thinks Iâm a crazy weirdo. Some fvcked up lies have been said about me. I donât even talk to anyone besides a couple people. How did this happen. Assholes. :(,1,But now that this asshole tells people lies and rumors about me it just broke me.

"There's no sugarcoating it really. I have a history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor. I'm 18 now and everything was going great since my birthday (septemeber). I was about to graduate, I had a girlfriend I adored, friends always wanting to do something, and I just generally felt happy. Until early December when my abuser came back into my life ( and I'm too much of a bitch to tell amyone other than my best friend ), one of my friends became toxic and we've slowly distanced, and then my girlfriend dumped me. I was actually dealing with everything well enough but her dumping me was the straw that broke the fragile camel's back. Short anecdote, but my first girlfriend and I broke up in April. I being a vulnerable 17 year old idiot, decided to go on tinder and just find someone, someone who could fill that void. Instead of dating though I just fucked. And not in a good ""I'm having so much sex it feels great!"" kinda way, but more in a last ditch effort for a sense of validity and feeling wanted, followed by complete resentment and disgust in myself afterwards. My current ex helped me not live like this anymore back in June, but then she ended things on the 27th. It was after a long text about all my problems that was induced by a severe overload of anxiety. I don't feel like she's not justified, I just wish I hadn't sent her that. My mind instead of talking it out or anything instead defaulted to my old habits. It's been one week and I've had a one night stand with three different people. I hate it, I never feel macho or confidence boosted after just gross and shameful.

Sex and I have always sorta been like that though. I mentioned my abuser, in short she molested and raped me multiple times through blackmail when I was 15. That's how I lost my virginity. I get that society places too much of an emphasis on it but my first sexual experience was while I was crying, screaming for her to stop, and being berated. I would have preferred better. So after then I just stopped caring about it or myself and just did it whenever I was with someone willing to do such. I always convince myself though, that the person I'm about to have sex with will be someone I want to be with, but that's never the case, yet I keep falling for it. I feel like a sociopath, I keep using other people for a fucked up sense of emotional relief, a way to forget about my ex-girlfriends, to forget about how much I used to care, and to convince myself I've always been this way, I just hided it.

I don't even know if half of this makes sense. I'm not even fully aware of why do it to be honest I think I'm addicted but I'm too terrified to admit that. This is more me just venting about being a manipulative cunt. Rarely do people ever actually read what I post, which usually leads to me deleting them, but if anyone is reading this, can you just tell me if I'm a horrible person for doing this because I can't help but feel as such.",1,"history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor"
"I might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out. 

Most of the time I start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends (as if) and an interesting life, like in a cartoon adventure or something. Sometimes I even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that could've happened. 

It's starting to become more and more frequent and I'm finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head. Then reality comes crashing down and it feels horrible when I realize my crazy fantasies will never happen. 

It's just so much better in my mind. Anyone else?",1, horrible when I realize my crazy fantasies will never happen.
"I should have done this a long time ago.

Let me begin by saying that I am a proud man.  I like to think I'm self-sufficient, and that I'm equipped to deal with the crap the world throws at me.  I'm not accustomed to asking for help, especially when it comes to my illness.  You see, no one in my family knows I suffer from chronic depression, because I have never been diagnosed as such.  But the truth is I've spent the majority of my entire life battling self-loathing, feelings of hopelessness, and thoughts of suicide.  And as I slog through what must certainly be a mid-life crisis, it's getting harder and harder to deal with on my own.

I am very slight of build, and I was bullied mercilessly as a child and teenager.  I learned to fight back, and have spent most of my life unwilling to put up with others' crap.  That has really hurt me socially and professionally, because everyone thinks I'm an asshole.  I'm now in my 40s, and I don't have any friends anymore, and don't really have much to do with my family, other than my mother.  I love her, and she loves me, but she's a tyrant.  She has supported me financially for years, and she's not afraid to remind me of that at every opportunity.  She's approaching her 70s now, and her health is deteriorating, leaving me as the only member of the family who would even consider caring for her (everyone else in my family draws disability or welfare, even though they're each perfectly capable of working, but none of them would lift a finger to care for my mother, so that falls on me).

I went to college, where I did very well.  I have a bachelors degree in music education, but after graduating I discovered fairly quickly that I can't stand children (much less their overbearing parents).  So I am now thousands of dollars in debt (student loans) that I can't afford to pay, all for a degree in which turned out to be a waste of time. I was never a particularly stellar performer, so that avenue is closed to me as well.  However, I've spent the past 20 years writing and arranging music for school bands and band instruments in a bid to validate going to college in the first place and salvage some sort of professional career, and some dignity.  Unfortunately, composing and arranging pays little to no money...certainly not enough to pay bills or better myself.  The truth is, I'm an outcast in that world, because again, I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to tell music teachers when they're not doing a good job.  So I feel that door has closed as well.

Since graduating college, I've had to resort to what amounts to a string of odd jobs which I've absolutely hated.  Customer service, human resources, retail, grocery, sales....all soul-crushing, tedious jobs that have always made me feel like a complete and utter failure in life, and wishing that writing music was a sustaining career.  

About 10 years ago, I got involved in a relationship with a woman who nearly ruined my financially.  It took me a long time to bounce back from that, but I did.  I had to move back home, though.  Unfortunately, since then, I've had an incredibly difficult time finding work at all.  I live in the rural south, where the only good paying jobs are in nursing and truck driving (neither of which I can do, nor would ever want to).  I can't even get a job flipping burgers or working in a grocery store, because I'm a man in my 40s with a degree, and am (according to employers and staffing managers) overqualified for anything short of, according to them, brain surgery.  Factories won't hire me for the same reason (and also because I cannot lift more than 40 pounds).  I'm subscribed to dozens of different job websites, and can't count the number of times I've nearly been scammed by fraudulent job listings...the sort that prey upon desperate people like me.  I've wasted thousands of dollars in gasoline driving to places of business in order to apply, only to be told ""You have to apply online"", and am then ridiculed by friends and family who assert ""You have to go meet employers face to face if you want to get hired"".  

In the past I've actually moved around the country in order to find work, but I've always been held back by 1). There's no such thing as a permanent full time job anymore, and 2). The extremely high cost of living, and anyway, as my mother gets older, that's no longer an option.  I'm stuck here, and I'm going broke.  If it weren't for my mother, I would be homeless, and just a few days ago she informed me that ""we're"" moving from a decent house in a quiet neighborhood to a mobile home next to a railroad....the last thing in the world my ego and self-esteem need right now.

I don't have health insurance.  I can't even afford it.  The state I live in doesn't offer Medicaid,  the premiums are too expensive on even the cheapest plans, and the copays at my local health department are too expensive.  My student loan is on deferment until they get tired of me requesting deferments (which may very will be next month).  I've been dealing with internal and external hemorrhoids for a decade, and I can't afford even have them looked at, much less do anything about it.  And I certainly can't afford therapy, or counseling, or medication for this depression.   Coupled with the fact that I don't even want to get out of bed most days, combined with the fact that I'm not getting any younger...I'm beginning to see the writing on the wall.

I'm a proud man.  I don't like to ask for help.  I don't want to apply for welfare or financial assistance, because 1). I most likely wouldn't qualify for it, and 2). to me, that's admitting total defeat, and surrendering any shred of dignity I have left.  I certainly don't like to ask for help from strangers on the internet, because frankly, I think it's a total waste of time and effort.  But I can feel a darkness creeping up on me, preparing to strangle the very life out me.  I see no hope for a future.  It just makes me so angry.  I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I've stayed out of trouble, and I don't bother anyone.  I worked very hard to better myself and, for my part, I've been a good person.  I don't care about money or wealth.  I just want a sense of purpose in life.  I want to be able to pay my bills and actually buy things I want rather than just what I need.  I want to be respected for my talents, and maybe even remembered when I'm gone.  But all of that seems totally out of reach now.  It's infuriating to see my suggested earning potential on job sites ($89,000 per year, btw), and then get a prospectus from Social Security letting me know that as of right now, when I turn 65 I'll only get $330 a month.  That makes it feel like everything, my education, my work history, my entire life...has all been for nothing.

I don't know what to do.  I applied for over 20 jobs today, and I won't hear back from a single employer because I'm a forty-something with a college degree.  I'm tired of being supported financially by my ailing mother.  I want to support HER.  I want to be able to afford an apartment at the very least, and not have to move into a damn trailer less than 20 feet from railroad tracks.  I want her to be proud of me.  I want my college professors to be proud of me.  I want to be proud of myself.  

But part of me also wants off this ride.  Part of me is afraid things are not going to get better.  How can they?  I'm running out of ideas.  I'm running out of options.  And I'm running out of patience.  I just don't know what else to do.

"Nothing Happens


Staring at the white wall I trace the rectangular patterns with my wet eyes and the pain strikes me again along with the voices. âGaby, youâre such a fuck up why are you even alive?â I cover my ears while I shake my head repeatedly. I lose control. In a plane falling out of the sky what can one do but brace for death? Every negative happening thatâs ever happened is replaying in my head, spun around where Iâve become the problem. The angle of death. The one thing that makes sure everything goes wrong. I see this seemingly true image of myself and I feel disgusted. The voices start yelling ugly words at me digging at my festering wrists. They wanna see blood but I wont give it to them. My whole body shaking, little puddles of tears on the floor, eyes like a madwoman the voices start screaming. Banging my head against the wall until my fight for survival becomes a fight for death I slump down, my head throbbing with a sharp pain in my skull. I laugh.

"Hey all.  
Sorry if I seem like I'm just dumping a lot here, I just feel I need help thinking through some issues. 

The big thing is a pretty damaging vicious cycle. I'm awful depressed because I'm lonely and feel I'm the only guy my age (22) who hasn't dated anyone, or even had any close friends I could trust and talk to. Never really hung out with anyone. Though I wish to change that and make a few friends in college, but not only do I not know how to go about it even though it's my third year, but I just feel that nobody would care about me. In fact, everyone from high school completely forgot about me, even before graduation, and we're a small class and everyone knows everyone's name. 

There's a lot of things that drift through my mind when I try to work through this, and I just get overwhelmed.  

A number of things leave me feeling worthless about myself.  

I happen to be mildly autistic, which honestly I don't understand much about it, but in school, word spread about it and plenty of people started talking to me as though I was retarded, even a few that knew I was just like any of them. I should be able to just get over that, but... you can only wonder if people are telling you that you're intelligent and capable out of pity so many times before you start getting paranoid.  

Plus, I see tons of other people who seem to have good friends they're always hanging out with, but I never know how to introduce myself to someone, honestly I'm scared I'll make an ass of myself. Enough that I literally get paralyzed when I try to talk to someone, my jaw seizes up and everything. But I'm ok with people approaching me, which never seems to happen, it's only happened once in my life. This makes me think, is the easier problem to fix that I struggle starting conversations, or that nobody wants to talk to me? 

I've got pretty bad image issues, too... I know that it's almost impossible to find a guy who'll say it, but there it is. I won't say I'm a heavy guy, because I don't look particularly bulky, but I... look up gynecomastia and you got me. I look like I've got boobs, and yes I'm a man and *hell* no, I'm not trans. I've been trying to work out and loose them, but while I've been loosing some weight they're not really being affected. I'll never look good in a tee shirt like this, it seems, and that's kinda why I'm struggling to start an athletic lifestyle... again, vicious cycle I gotta break out of. 

Lots of things to work through here... I feel absolutely overwhelmed. ",1,"happen to be mildly autistic, in school, word spread about it and plenty of people started talking to me as though I was retarded,"
"I hate myself, i hate everything I am.  I wish I didn't.  Or maybe I really don't.  Maybe I just can't take the negative thoughts, the pain, the apathy, the endless battle you can never win anymore.  I feel like I'm worthless, like I mean nothing to anyone.  I'm always trying to live up to impossible expectations from a person that doesn't exist.  I hurt, and hurt, and hurt and hurt so much that my heart may as well explode and nothing changes.  I go to bed, I wake up the next day and repeat that for however long I get to till I'm back here.  Knowing that there will never be a point where I don't come back here till the day I die.  

Why don't I get to be normal?  Why don't I get to be happy without the looming sadness and anger?  What did I do to deserve this?  Is it because I exist?  Not letting me live wasn't enough punishment.

Sometimes I feel like I want to die. Like I donât care if I died or not at that moment. But sometimes I donât want to at all. Does that make sense/is that normal? 

I was raped a few years ago but have never spoken to someone professional about it. My husband knows but he doesnât speak about it and tells me I should talk to someone if I want to.

When I watch tv programmes or see news articles of people getting raped I get really angry, I think this might be when I start thinking about ways I could die. If I was dead Iâd never have to be reminded or think about rape again. 

Some days my thoughts overwhelm me and I donât want to get out of bed. I want to get up and have a nice day but something just seems to stop me. I donât know what and I just feel really shit and down.

"So I have been effed up in life several times. I've got quite a background with depression , rejection and bullying. I'm 21 and I feel like my life is already doomed, like there is no way out of this.

I've been struggling with paradoxical feelings, because I met a girl who I've fallen in love with, but she has bpd and got a full time job. We rarely speak now, only in March will she be available again. She makes me feel good about myself, like the only thing that truly makes me happy. I care about her so much, so I am letting her set her life straight and not talk to her. She's rarely in the mood anyways, as she gets home too tired to talk or too depressed. She told me she loves me, but she's not ready for a relationship yet. I'd love to heal her and make her happy, regardless of being in a relationship with her or not. I just want her to be happy. That alone, would make things better.

I struggle with some kind of mental illness. I can't say what it is, since I've never been diagnosed. I believe, however that I have depression and/ or avpd.

Also, she lives in another country and I'm scared that if I meet her in person, things will change. Like, she will stop liking me. I'm very awkward in real life and can't express a fourth of what I write.

I'm scared of completely deliver my heart to her, although I do trust her. But, I just have a feeling that she may not want it, since she mentioned she's not ready for a relationship yet.

She's been with abusive exes and has a rough past, which is no wonder she is trying to protect herself.

So what should I do? We are both afraid, but we love each other. We are planning to eventually meet up one day. But that is what scares us. We are afraid of hurting each other and being hurt. Maybe because it may won't work out, not because we would actually hurt each other.

She's my everything. This is the first time I felt such strong feelings. I am numb on the inside, but when I am with her, all my demons fade away.

It frustrates me being so useless to her. I want to do something for her, but she's been to busy. We haven't spoken in more than a week. It will probably carry on till March or something.

I've been severely depressed. Talking to close friends helps a bit, but my closest friends are online friends. My real life friends are not that close and I don't feel comfortable with them.

The darkest thoughts have been running through my mind, and I've been idealizing suicide lately. The only thing that keeps me from doing it is that I have family who loves me, and I have online friends who are also family to me. If I ever did it, they would not know about it, I'd just become inactive forever, and that would certainly pain them more than my family since they would not know if I was dead or not.

Even so, I don't know how long I'll last. Don't mean to be pessimistic, but things aren't looking okay. I feel like my feelings don't make sense and that my thoughts are too confusing. It's becoming unbearable ",1,ejection and bullying. I'm 21 and I feel like my life is already doomed
"My adventure with depression started at start of middle school. I went to new school with many thugs. I am a quiet, peaceful, so I was bullied harshly - like throwing lit matches at me, laughing at my acne, once whole gym with 70 people laughed, because I couldn't make a simple exercise, dog barked when we were coming back from school and they said ""Even dog doesn't like you"". To add fuel to the fire, when I came back home parents were screaming at each other, because of my alcoholic father and financial problems. I was totally alone with all the problems and it seemed like whole world is against me.

After few months I changed school with ""normal"" people not thugs. However something changed in me. The world was dark, I had negative thoughts about myself, world and others 24/7 like ""I am worthless"", ""People are evil and want to use me"", ""People are suffering around the world"". I had nightmares everynight like I was holding injured man on apocalyptic landscape and there was an atomic alarm, on the sky there was a sign ""magnetic field can kill you"" then I woke up screaming, but the real world looked like in this nightmare. There was no escape. At start I fought with it, but after a while I accepted this dark world. I watched dark movies, listened to dark ambient etc. This lasted 6 years. I tried many SSRI's, but nothing worked. 

At the end of high school I started experimenting with dissociatives like ketamine. They helped me a little, but at the end of school I tried to commit suicide and was sent again to psychiatrist. He gave me venlafaxine and it was miracle.

I mixed it with dissociatives, because there are studies linking ketamine as useful with depression treatment. Now, after 3 years I don't use ketamine or SSRI's and my world looks like heaven. I feel good all the time, no negative thoughts, have motivation to do things, colors are bright, no nightmares, normal self-esteem (while in depression I thought that I was a complete shit and shouldn't even breath, because of waste of oxygen).

"I grew up being raped and molested by my step dad from age 5 to 11 and once by an uncle at age 7. I have witnessed 7 suicides in my life, 4 of them infront of me and the others I walked in on after it was done. I have been beaten daily till I was bleeding or my step dad got tired of hitting me from age 5 to 17. I was homeless from 18 to 27, I never knew my real dad but for a few months before he died of liver failure, I was 23, then at 25 my mother committed suicide. at the age of 37, I have PTSD and severe depression and severe social anxiety. 

for the past 8 years I have been on this site and many others trying to find someone to build a connection with, get close too, make memories with, share things with, eventually build a life together and become a serious couple that settled down.

For the past 8 years I have been told I am ugly, disgusting, worthless, useless, told I have nothing to offer anyone, told I don't deserve love or a relationship or a woman, told I need to kill myself.

For the past 8 years I have been lead on by a couple women who pretended like they wanted me and was interested in me and after 5 or 6 months of this, they would fake their death or call me having sex with someone or disappear then turn around and stalk me.

I have been rejected over 2 thousand times in the past 8 years all because I am obese, I struggle with low thyroid, a very slow metabolism, and genetics from both parents being obese, and just found out that I have very low testosterone, although I have a high sex drive. All of these issues plus my PTSD effects my weight and makes a breeding ground for obesity as my Dr. has put it. I walk 3 miles a day, I eat healthy, baked chicken, boiled veggies, etc. I stay away from soda pops but once a week I will drink a soda, once a month I will eat a pint of ice cream. it helps me stay on track and away from fast food and deep fried stuff. But it doesn't matter, because of my health issues that are causing the obesity.

But see, yet no one wants to get to know that about me, no one wants to get to know anything about me, they just see the outside of me and what income I have then reject me. No one cares for who I am as a person, no one cares for how I am as a person, no one cares what I am like as a person, no one cares about my personality or attitude. No one cares how I would treat them. They just see my weight then walk away.

I may not have much in the looks department to offer, I may not have much in the money department to offer. But what I did have to offer was pure true unconditional love, true loyalty, a heart filled with pure love and a mind filled with acceptance and understanding. someone who wouldn't ever cheated or left, or ever played mind games, someone who would been so loyal to you, someone who would have treated you with gentle care and love. someone who would been very romantic and devoted.

Well, I give up looking, I am done looking. I am to the point I just don't care if I ever find anyone or ever be with anyone. well this is my good bye letter to all the women on here. I hope many of you who I crossed paths with are proud of yourselves for how you did me and how you treated me. and for those of you who I never talked too, sorry we never got a chance. if you would have given me one.

I am just done with it all. I just can't take anymore and am ending it tonight.

"Hello there.

First of all, this isn't an 'emergency' or something, I'm not suicidal and I know I'll get over this depression, but maybe somebody can help make it quicker.

I'm a 27 year old male and about 5 months ago I lost the parent who raised me. I was fat most of my life, except for a few years when I was a teen. I'm 5'10 (178cm) and 285 pounds (130kg) atm, I'm really unhappy with my body and my voice. I'm not handsome by any standard and I'm poor too (and I'm getting bald).

Recently I fell in love for a girl but she lives in US and she's smart and beautiful, I'm from western Europe and I don't have the money to go to US. If I had the means to go I'd surely at least try even though I know I'd probably be rejected (like, 99.9% of chance). I have a lot of responsibilities here too. I'm losing weight but it's probably going to take a few months/years to reach my ideal and even when that happens I guess I'll have loose skin. The fact is: I wouldn't want to date someone like me, how can I expect others to? Please don't come up with that acceptance thing, although I really appreciate the good intentions I just can't change what my brain finds attractive or not.

I've never been with a girl I loved ( or not :P ), I've only loved 3 girls so far, one when I was 17 and I was slim and such, but I didn't have the balls to express my feelings. Then again when I was I guess 20 or something, I wasn't very obese so I was somewhat OK with my weight, but the girls was from Australia and we didn't even have the time to know each other better.

People keep saying that's a 'crush' or something, but that's a start isn't it? I mean, I don't feel like approaching girls I don't feel something strong for and I totally don't believe 'real long-lasting love' will emerge from a forced relationship. A girl once wanted to approach me (but I was in love with that 2nd girl) so I suppose I'm not unbearably ugly but I certainly can't compete with the other guys in terms of looks.

I've been working my 'bottom' off for some time now, and I hope to make some money to be financially comfortable, but I don't want a girl to like me because of that, while I surely plan to use some of the money to improve myself.

I like smart girls with strong political opinions and definitely I don't like 'good' girls that are OK with everything and always trying to avoid conflicts. This girls I'm in love with really seems the perfect match, I honestly never been so sure about that, but I simply can't have her.

So, this is the situation I'm facing at the moment, my heart aches so much but I don't express it to others. I don't have anyone to talk about that only my dog and although that helps a bit it doesn't count much.

I'm trying to focus on my work to forget her but I can't. Everything I see feels familiar in a way that reminds her, this is something I never felt before, even looking at this text somehow I remind her face. Maybe there's a hormonal imbalance or something. I'm certainly not discarding the possibility of a physiological effect.

So, sorry for the big text and thank you for reading it. I'd really appreciate any advice on that. Thank you very much.

"Hey, /r/Depression/ . I'm not sure whether I want to post here or in /r/SuicidalWatch/ as I'm having mixed feelings.

I'm from the type of people who pays attention to the detail, so let me give you some background. I'm a 19-y-o boy working as a waiter, which job was wrapped up by my grandmother. Yeah, living with my parents, and grandparents. I'm living in a very advanced level of poverty... even this is a miracle considering the chances, in my country, of being employed solely on a diploma.
This is the job I've started off after living 4 months of unemployment. I really f|cking prefer living my whole live unemployed, rather than being employed in such a sh|tty job. ""Why don't you just change your job? Or the very least, change the workplace?"" It's not as simple as that. No one hires. This just as in, because you really do need a good certification or degree from (preferably) the... richest... places. E.g. Microsoft certification, or an Oxford degree.
Now let me tell you about the job I'm stuck on working. Every. goddamn. day. And I'm almost wanting to cry typing this, because it only reminds me of what I'll have to face tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and et cetera. I don't like my job, because co-workers, I don't like the F&amp;B Manager (Food and Bar Manager), I don't like the boss, and the clients, towards which I force myself to have positive feelings, because I'm a waiter, and this is a positive, and a default trait.
I'm an outsider working with not-so-intelligent co-workers, but very experienced in the field. It's because I'm new and know nothing about this genre. No one teaches me anything regarding how to work, and how to work the work. When I try to do something on my own, I usually fail, because no one offers a hand (referred as to teaching), then the staff of the whole hotel (the workplace) gather togheter, talking to each other that I'm incompetent, I'm stupid, they laugh at me, and feel a relief telling me ""You aren't good for anything. Better quit this job as soon as you can. It's the same even if you're working. You're only causing troubles, and issues."" 
A usual worker would think, ""Well, it's not an estimation by a manager."" But the thing is, my co-workers are very close with the manager, and always whine to him how I'm not good for anything. If I try to 'raise my voice' (figuratively), I always get a huge backlash of bullshit. I.e. there has been a problem, and I'm not in fault, but if it is in correlation with the experienced co-workers, it usually is my fault. Kind of a handicap. It got to a point where my manager cuts a lot of tasks, duties, and obligations, because I'm 'incompetent'. Today he saw me trying to carry 2 things at once, and got irritated, then told me by a very unpleased voice and body language 'Just stop trying to multi-task.' But I usually am good in multi-tasking, but the cowardice feeling (anxiety closy-by [It's really not anxiety, but I really do get VERY scared]) of having someone around me that watches what I'm doing, and probably expects the failure. And it really increases the chance of failure.
I really do have a friend of mine in the staff, but this can't really compensate anything. I have (had) friends, with which I've lost contact long time ago, and basically what I'm doing in life currently is go home, sleep, and to work again.

[#The Having Positive Feelings Towards Thoughts Of Death]
I usually watch entertaining or educational videos, which I've watched before, but the difference is that now I don't feel anything. I just feel depression, which cannot leave me. When watching utensils, I get a little uplifting feeling, which is caused by thoughts of harming myself. I really can't do anything about it, nor can you. The premise is that I want to get A LOT of weight off of my burden.

This is the life I'm living. Handicapped. It literally feels like you're tied, and can do nothing else, but to accept hard hits. Thank you for paying attention... not even the guests of the hotel are That merciful.",1,"I'm an outsider working with not-so-intelligent co-,the staff of the whole hotel (the workplace) gather togheter, talking to each other that I'm incompetent, I'm stupid, they laugh at me"
"Sorry, this is my first reddit post ever because I'm really good at lurking but not at contributing to anything. I'm starting my second semester of college at IUS soon, and I'm really excited because it's my only way I get to go out and do things besides staying home and slowing drifting towards wanting to die. 

Every day I hope I make a new friend but I realize I'm wrong and I go home feeling like shit because I feel like everyone thinks I'm as shitty I as I feel I am. I asked this guy I liked out after I embarrassed myself the day before and I fucked everything up; I lost all chance of dating I had with him. Everyday is just another day for me to feel lonely. On the last day of drawing class we had I started violently crying before class at my easel because I'm a weak piece of shit. I got a 3.5 gpa on my first semester back though and that makes me feel really happy.

I can't even think of what to say when I try to talk to people; I always draw blanks in my mind and I end up just awkwardly being there with nothing to say and nothing to contribute. I'm only able to be friends with people who are able to put up with my shit and are able to put effort into being with me because I'm barely putting enough effort into being alive.

I still have hope though that good things will happen to me and make me feel like I'm an actual person and not a corpses that just goes day to day doing nothing. 

I'm also going to this sleepover thing for the new years and I hope I'm able to make friends.

"Grades. Looks. Achievements. Medals. Friends.

The inferiority complex. That second word ... the word carries so much weight

It's like an endless competition against the world. 

Every day, every minute, every breathe, it feels like a competition.

A gladiator match. A Hunger Games type of feel.

It's a big war on who has the biggest dick.

Every minute, I compare with others about everything.

How managed to get what they wanted at a much earlier age than I do. 
How they manage to get a hold of their own life but I ever did. 

How much I keep comparing grades *(which is my greatest weakness because I focus on it too much on a daily basis but I end getting bad grades anyway because my anxiety keeps killing me ... makes me procrastinate and black out and give up)*

Every day I am shaking the minute I wake up. 

Every day, I feel like I have this need, this compulsion, this must to be better than everyone else in every way ... but I am too weak. 




I am paralysed in that endless competition against others and everyone else in this world goddamned planet and at the same time, I lack the slighest motivation to even do the slightest change because I give up before I even do anything because I have an inferiority complex, one that I feel like I am an ant among giants or gods.

*(or when I did make a move to be better, I pushed so much that it took over my life. An obsession that became so invasive and destructive that instead of my mind verbally and psychologically abusing me in one way, I allowed it to abuse me in a different way. When I did want to make a change, I went too far and it became dysfunctional)*

In my head, I feel like I am at war. I feel like I am in an endless bloody nightmare against my own head. Sometimes, I even lay down my arms before it starts because I am too exhausted and fed up of fighting over and over and over and over again.

On the outside, I feel frozen. I am shaking every day. Even right now, I am shaking because I am constantly being reminded on how much of a pathetic, weak and ungrateful little bastard I am because no matter how much I try, no matter how much I wanted to push myself, I never am able to do it.

When I try to be better, I fuck up. I panic, I feel like giving up, I feel like I running through a battlezone where there are a thousand bombs exploding everywhere, terrified as hell. I feel little and weak and scared.

I feel like I am walking on a thin rope but I am shaking because I am scared. 

I feel like a thousand voices are screaming inside my head constantly all the time. They make me shake even more and because of that, I end up falling

Again. And again and again.

Sometimes, I even fall on purpose because I want to hurt myself because even though I have that compulsion to be better, I give up immediately.

It's like when there is a bully who is about to beat me, I beat myself instead just to save the time and energy and because I deserve it.

So I do that over and over and over again. From the minute I wake up. Every minute, I feel like I am in a battle between myself and my self hatred and more often than not, my self hatred wins.

So I beat myself. Over and over again.

And then I keep noticing how much I hate myself and because of that, I feel pathetic. I feel despicable.

And when I compare myself to others, that is the perfect fuel to add to the fire that is already burning me from the inside while I am tied up with my mouth shut.

I sit on my chair or stay on my bed, staring at the wall, or looking at the paper that I am supposed to write. I end up staring at it for hours, because I even lack that tiniest skills or the tiniest effort to push myself to even do it. But even if I did try, I know that I don't want to ""just try"", I want to go all out. 100%. ... No, 200%. 300%. I want to be the best. The best of the best. But I feel pathetic either way. So, I don't do much effort. 

So I get bad grades or fail .... another perfect fuel to the fire. 

My mind feels like it hit the gold mine. It has the perfect tools to make its bitch. It has me chained like an animal and it slaps and belittles every minute.

I look at others, I don't see people, I see numbers and qualities, those who have beaten me, those who I need to beat, those who I am already better than them and those who I absolutely can never beat.

All of them, my mind will still find ways to make its bitch even more.

____________________________________________________

Every day I go through this. Every day I have to put up to this. Every day I have to keep on going through this torture.

A world like this one, a world where everyone is constantly competing against each other, whether it is people competing for more likes on social media, or competing who has the higher grades or more income, or who has the better girlfriend and has the better sex, or has the happiest life, or who is more successful and able to beat his competition, or who is able to get the job he wants and the rest keep struggling and maybe even end up poor, a world where misery has become a means of humouring people like social media likes to poke fun of other people's flaws and failures, or the news likes to cause drama and panic when someone makes a mistake or something happens, no matter how big or small, or teachers and parents or people in charge, telling you what to be or not to be, how to dress, eat, drink and write, what to think or not to think, how you should be or not be. 

Plenty of people around, often looking for whatever faults and regrets and flaws you have, so that they could exploit it and take advantage of it and make you worse, 

Not to mention the internet, how much it is so full of trolls and cyber bullies who want to make you feel like you are the worst person on the planet, just because they can ....

 ... just the right kind of drug to give this bully, this abusive mind of mine that I was somehow chosen to have with me on a daily basis, the right kind of negativity and anxiety and torture to make me feel like I sold my soul to the devil and I deserve all that suffering.

That constant anxiety. That constant terror.

It is so much easier to just grab the rope and end it right there. 

Why would you choose to keep experiencing this day by day, night after night?

______________________________________________________________

Even right now, as I am typing this, I am reading and re-reading what I wrote, I am constantly shaking, I cannot think clearly and my mind is keeping a sharp eye on whatever spelling mistake or grammatical error or how much I sound like a person whose language are as poor as a mentally retarded person because his anxiety is so high everyday that he cannot think clearly at all, that mind is like a bully behind me, waiting to strike when I am at my most vulnerable. When I feel ashamed for a mistake that I made. When I am reminded about a past grade that I wished I could have done better. When I lost someone who cared about to someone else.

I often wish that I could grab a gun and shoot myself in the head. Maybe I will make that voice in my head shut up once and for all, but then again, it will still win anyway. Suicide is for cowards and pussies anyway ... and it calls me a coward and a pussy everyday.

If I keep breathing air in this damned planet, it will find a way to make me suffer and win anyway in the end. If I just end it, it will win either way.

"So, here is my deal. Im successful. I am in great shape. I have a good life.

However, i have 0 self worth. 0 Self esteem. The worst. It's been this way for years.

**Backstory**
Severely abused as kid.  Then when i got out, I would over react to situations like a psycho. Extreme over the top protective responses to minor things.  I never hurt anyone, hit anyone, but was a hot emotional mess with how i handled things.  Learned to manage that with years of therapy.

Additionally, I would often find myself in relationships with women, who were horribly abusive and did some pretty shit things, further hurting my self esteem that i would allow my self to be treated like that.


So, i guess i feel since that I have allowed people to treat me as if i had 0 self worth for so long, that i feel like new great people wont possibly feel different. 

Additionally, I have alot of anxiety that alot of people may think I am crazy/emotionally unstable if tot hear of some of my situations in the past and i have stopped interacting with new people simply out of this fear.


i guess my difficulty, is that if i was overweight, I would feel like atleast i could put a plan into place where i could logically lose the weight and help me feel better.

however, i have maxed out everything that i can improve that way(body, finances).  I have to change the way my mind works and honestly, it seems impossible.

"For a little while there, things were looking up. I was talking to lots of people at work and in my classes, I was (kind of) making friends. Nothing serious, but it was 10x better than where I was before. I thought that I was finally getting out of this seemingly endless depression that I was in (I've been dealing with it for years now). For the first time in a very long time I felt like I was getting better.

Ha. Right.

Here I am on New Year's, sitting in my room crying and feeling sorry for myself. Probably going to get drunk in a second. Nobody invited me to do anything or even included me in their mass-texted happy new years wishes. There was one person who I thought I was really hitting it off with who I was going to chill with for new years, but he's suddenly not really talking to me and ditched me tonight (*he* suggested hanging out) to go out and do something else (which he also didn't invite me to). I'm not mad at anybody for not inviting me, don't get me wrong I know I'm not entitled to an invite to anything. But shit...why am I even fucking trying? Apparently I'm not worth being friends with. I'm just the last resort when you're so bored at work or school that you'll talk to whoever's around. 

And it's not even like ""oh don't take it personally, everyone has 'work friends' separate from people they actually hang out with all he time."" But even that's not true. Everyone at my job is super close and they hang out all the time in big groups.

So I have many problems, and I'm not going to point each of them out for the sake of keeping this post as short as possible.
I suffer from depression and loneliness and it's getting worse day by day.

Ever since I was in Kindergarten, I was always the odd one out. Honestly though, I don't think I'm at fault here.
Fast forward to middle school and high school, I was/am still alone all the time. Literally.

I'm always alone during recess and I haven't smiled genuinely in 2 years now. I do get happy sometimes but never smiled genuinely.
All the friendships I had just crashed and burned because me and the other person(s) never interacted much in real life or not interacted enough. 

Most of my ""strong"" friendships have been through messaging rather than real life reactions. I have never been in trouble or on an adventure with anyone when those stuff are exactly what makes the base of a real and strong friendship.

Not to mention that I have been made fun of a lot for my taste of music or the way I dress or why I never diet to lose a couple of pounds (seriously, I am fat but not obese.)

And because I went through a lot of difficulties during childhood and early adolescence and I had no one to advice me or be there for me, I've gotten really self conscious and insecure about almost everything. And I'll be honest here, I hate myself so much because of it and I have tried to commit suicide multiple times before.

Getting bullied, being underestimated and looked down upon by your classmates and teachers and also being left alone all the time does make one think ""why? Why am I the only one alone and why am I soooo hated and unwelcome everywhere? Am I such a bad person?"" And all those endless questions and the dark abyss of depression.

I have a strict dad who doesn't let me do most things others my age do and a mom who doesn't want me to defy my dad. Also, financially speaking, I don't come from a rich family like my classmates do but we have enough to live and afford a couple of luxuries.
I love my family so much but they have never understood my problems and struggles which is the main reason why I am the way I am right now. I'm pretty sure if we at least tried to understand each other, not just me but not one of my family members would suffer from a chronic depression and/or have thoughts of dying and committing suicide.
My family don't understand me, they love me but they don't understand me which is why I can't have a real deep conversation with any of them.

Recently, I have found quite a few good people as friends but because we all have our own priorities, we barely see each other and most of the time our interactions are through texts, and that way we won't have a strong and/or real friendship and I also think a lot about it because I honestly don't know what having friends is like... I don't want to be the only one who cares a lot about the others and would go to such extents for them but then after a while the whole friendship crashes and burns.
I want to tell them that I am here to stay but I also know that now is not the time because we have to have more real life interactions and know each other more.

Speaking of my other friendships... The friendships I considered to be real ended up with me being stabbed in the back and left alone with a broken heart.
And I found out that I had no real friends but everyone were just classmates when I considered them to be friends last year when I lost a very dear uncle whom I loved more than both my parents and considered myself to be his daughter, no one had my back then... No one told me to cheer up or at least kept me company until I was strong enough to overcome it.

Right now I am very exhausted of everything... I just want to relax a bit feeling respected and loved a little without worrying about who I am.

I just want to stop hating myself and start loving myself, build up my self esteem.

So tell me, great people of reddit, how do I stop hating myself, deal with loneliness and depression (preferably overcome both of them) and keep these new friendships I have made going without forcing any of those whom I deeply love and care about?

"I was sexually abused as a child, there I said it. I hate bringing it up, it's a mood killer and it's not hard to see why. The problem is, well, there are many problems. Let's just go through some of them: Extreme anxiety and depression, self doubt, little to no self confidence, the feeling that I am malingering when I am not (idk how to explain it), feeling constantly alone, forcing myself into positions where I am alone. You get the idea.

I also have terrible coping mechanisms, I mostly play video games to pass the time, I am smart as my mother constantly reminds me, but all I see are my failures. I only find happiness from other people, I am always angry and sad, and this paragraph is a mess and now I'm crying.

"When I was around 10 my mom was babysitting kids and we went outside to play. When we were playing we ended up using the hose and for some odd reason I told my friend to hold the hose so it wouldn't squirt water and I put my face over it and he let go and i angrily threw a plastic play toy at him ( a light toy ). My mom became instantly angry. She started saying come here in a angry voice and I ran across the yard. Surprisingly she didn't come get me. Long story short I ran in the house went under the couch and hid. My mom rang the phone to my dad and he answered my mom whose was screaming because she couldn't find me. She found me and grabbed me and I kept yelling ""god please help."" And she put her knees on my arm and grabbed a pillow and put it over my face. But then she let go and told me to go down stairs. She told me how much I was a mistake and how she hated me and doesn't love me.

I still remember that day like it was yesterday. I tried killing myself 3times this month because I think about it everyday. I don't know what to do because it emotionally scared me. Can some one please help me.",1," playing outside with friends, threw a play toy at him, mom became instantly angery, hid under couch, mom found me ,grabbed me, I kept yelling ""god please help"", she put her knee on my arm , grabbed a pillow and put over my face, but let go, she said I was a mistake"
"I suspect that what I'm dealing with is a mixture of anxiety and depression, but I haven't been to talk to anyone yet. I'm a college student and plan to see one of the psychologists on-campus after they reopen for spring semester. Anyway, I've been dealing with a lot of issues of feeling alone, sad, and generally hating myself. Not all the time...but enough for it to be an issue. I only talk to my boyfriend because he's the only one I trust. I have one friend but we aren't close enough to discuss ""real"" issues. My anxiety stems from having a chronic illness and being sexually abused in a past relationship, on top of a lot of general social anxiety. A lot of my ""depression"" (I say that in quotes because I'm not sure if that's what it is yet) is self-defeating. I frequently find my mind telling me that I'm worthless, even though I logically know it isn't true. There have even been times when I'm home alone and force myself to go somewhere because 1)I'm too miserable in my own head and 2)I'm afraid I'll succomb to hurting (NOT killing) myself if I'm alone with my own thoughts. I've just been struggling a lot lately and wondered if anyone has similar experiences and has gotten through it. I am going to see someone, and I'm contemplating Zoloft. Not as a real fix, but just something to help me dig out of this hole I'm in right now. Sorry this was so long, just a lot of thoughts to shuffle through!

"Hi there. Sorry this is a bit long. I'm looking for some advice or words of wisdom on how to cope with a severely depressed and suicidal best friend.

We've been best friends since high school. We went to different colleges, but she ended up transferring to my school (huge state school) this year. It's been hard on her -- she hasn't made many friends. I hung out with her often and always invited her out with my friends, but I think she feels uncomfortable joining and my friends find her to be annoying. She's been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as I've known her and has been consistently in therapy. She thought she was bipolar, but recently found out that she actually has borderline personality disorder and her parents/doctors have known for years. I think this makes her even more depressed.

This year she got really into xanax and was constantly barred out. I don't fuck with drugs for a lot of reasons and she is always pressuring me to try them, so I feel very uncomfortable around her when she's super messed up. One night she showed up at my dorm at 3am and passed out in the hallway after taking 7 bars and mixing it with alcohol. I took her to the emergency room and she stayed at the hospital for several days in the psychiatric ward. She doesn't get along with her family and refused to let her parents visit her or make any medical decisions. During this time, I was the only person she would contact so I brought her everything she needed, visited multiple times daily, helped her get excuses for all her classes, etc. 

After this incident she promised she was done with xanax. I know now that she continued to abuse it almost daily, but was more secretive about it. She went out and partied every weekend, acting like everything was fine. She got fired from her job (we work together) and failed all her exams. She found out that she's pregnant and doesn't know who the father is, and asked me to come with her to get an abortion. She told me she was going to take the next semester off and try to figure things out. She blamed me for encouraging her to transfer and not being there for her. In hindsight, I know I could have done more to help her adjust to the new school, but she repeatedly told me she didn't like my friends and wanted to make her own. 

She hooked up with my ex boyfriend when she was blacked out. I forgave her because I know she doesn't remember it and wouldn't have done it sober, but it still upsets me when I think about it.

Two days ago she tried to kill herself. She drank half a bottle of vodka and took 20+ different types of pills. She sent me a suicide note via text in which  she wanted me to send paragraphs she'd written to multiple different people. There was a note for me at the end-- she said that I ""was never there for her"" and that she feels sorry for me because I'm more ""fucked up"" than she is and I don't even realize it. 

I called her immediately, got her to send me her location, and then called 9-1-1 and her parents. When the ambulance got there, she was foaming at the mouth and they said she would have died within 20-30 minutes. Her mom has been keeping me updated the past two days. She woke up today and luckily doesn't have any brain damage. She's been asking to talk to me but doesn't have access to her phone and doctors won't let her speak or visit with any non-family members.

I just don't know what to do. The past six months have been hell for her, but also for me. She hasn't been there as a friend at all, which is completely understandable given the situation, but I've found myself becoming more distant from her. She tells me that I'm the best friend she's ever had, and then the next day says everyone else is telling her to not be my friend because I'm such a shitty person? I feel like I'm becoming depressed myself now. My therapist told me that the friendship is toxic. Everyone thinks I'm crazy for sticking by her. But all  her other friends have abandoned her. I see how much pain she's in, and I know she would do the same for me. At the same time I don't think I can keep this up much longer. I'm still her best friend, but she's no longer mine.

It makes me so sad to think about all of the good memories we have together. Would a true friend stand by her through this, even though she doesn't seem to want me to? I don't ever want to be in this situation again where her life is in my hands. Any advice/input would be greatly appreciated.",1,"friend severly depressed, borderline personlity disorder, abuses drugs, attempted suicide, snet suicide note, calls me shitty person, never been  there for her, toxic friendship"

"I have been trying for a long time. I dont know if I can ever get over the things that have happened to me in my life or if I can ever be happy. I have a daughter so I dont want to do anything that will make it harder for her. But I dont know what else to do. I dont know if Im codependent on this misery or what. I know every day I wake up its going to be more of the same. I hate feeling this way. I want to be happy and alive and 'me' again. But so much has happened and Im going to be 43 this month. Why should I keep trying to find solutions? By the time I fix what needs fixing...even if I can, Ill be to old to enjoy any of it. Im tired of living a life of pain and suffering. I mask it with smoking weed or meds. It seems like I just lose more as I go on. Friends pass away from disease or suicide, family members pass on. I am struggling with wether or not to end my life. I wonder if I should look for easy ways to do it. I keep thinking about it but the ways I envision all seem like horrible ways to go out and Ive been through enough pain. Why should I try to hang on again? I wish that I mattered. Or that I was important enough for someone to care. After 20 years of ptsd and the anxiety and depression Im in a place where Im unable to work or provide for myself. I dont know if I do or dont want disability or if I can even get it. I grew up cutting down trees, building houses and raising horses and what not. My pride is something that comes up over and over. Ive been out of work for over 5 years. Ive been kept isolated for most of that and its one thing to have therapy and medicine. But Im still stuck here dependent on someone who has abused me. But maybe I should give them more time. I know Im not perfect. I have my own issues. Maybe Im just screwing everything up with this line of thinking. But I do know that I am co dependent. After all the abuse and nightmares and the pain, I dont know if I will ever be able to live the life I want to. Why would I choose to stay like this? I dont want to keep going like this. This isnt how its supposed to be. Life and the world around us really does fascinate me and I always wanted to find a place in it. But after all this time of being cut off from it I cant keep coming up with reasons to just keep hurting. I dont want to have to keep coming back and doing things like this as a last ditch effort.  I used to be so resilient and able to bounce back, nowadays im just so worn out and tired and drained.  Life keeps dangling a carrot in front of my face.  And like a fool I try to chase it, just to to find more pain.  Im tired of trying.  Im tired of feeling like Im damned.  I dont want to get on here and make a post like this for attention.  I just DONT want to feel like this anymore.  And its getting worse and harder to deal with.  If there was a button I could push that would end it painlessly I wonder if i would press it.  When its like this I wonder why in the hell I wouldnt press it.  There were things I wanted to do with my life.  Things I was sure that I was here to do.  And now it seems my whole lifes purpose was just to suffer.  I still feel like that little boy who was beaten bloody as a kid and taught to live in fear.  Why is it that he cant get justice?  Life was suppose to be somuch fuller and more beautiful.  But for me, my mind is under attack more often than not.  I have been doing all I can for years now, Id be lying if I said some things havent gotten better.  But at this rate Ill never get there in time.  And Ive been doing it on my own with little to no help while other people are working against me.  When will it get better?  When do the good things start happening?

"26, the only son of a proud Asian family, gay since birth. Coming out is never an option at it would DESTROY my parents, and I love them so bad. 
The main problem, I'm struggling with overcoming this ""love"" with my straight friend (For almost 3 years now, he just got married last year). As I learnt how to fake my feeling since I was a kid, I did it so well even now he still has no idea about (At least it's what I think). In the last two years I've been trying to keep the distance but still no use, the feeling just keeps getting stronger.  Ironically enough, all my life I've met so many people, but only have feeling for that only guy. Yep, the first ever, and only one til this day. Like a fucking joke, sounds romantic (if we remove the gender details) but so fucked up at the same time (as it actually is). Even worse, he sure loves me (like bro to bro). I did so many mean stuffs to keep the distance, things like replying K, being aggressive, ignoring his birthday, his new year message etc. very very mean, but the guy seems to be too patient with me, looks like he clearly wants us back to be best bro as we did before. Forgot to mention, we were co-worker for more than a year, then life happens, he moved abroad (This was when I decided to stop being nice to him - with hope of finding an escape for myself but failed :/), and later on, got married. That means there's been a real geographical distance between us as well - even that wouldn't do any good to my feeling.
It's such a shame to admit this but you guys can't imagine how many night I've lost sleep, crying all the tears I got, praying that god or any higher power up there, please erase me from this life, then the next day everyone would forget my existence and just move on. I want to die, but don't want to kill my parents selfishly. I'm tired of being alone, but then I can only fake my feeling to an extent, showing affection to a girl - that's too much for me. Would also do me no good for sure, I'm hungry for true happiness, something that can't be faked.
I still go to work everyday, fake my laughter. I have a job that pays well, you can say I'm financial independent. But none of this matters soon, being the only son I MUST keep the family's bloodline going. But well, with this mess inside my head, I don't know what to do now. I've been thinking about confessing it all to him, maybe that will actually freak him out and I can finally move on? But, damn, so many but, the idea of actually losing him from my life forever scares the shit out of me. After all I'm this loser who can have his whole week brightened just by receiving a text ""hey"" from a bro I'm secretly in love, even though I'll just pretend to ignore it or reply with K. It's that pathetic.",1," Asian , Gay, cannot come out, love guy friend, he moved abroad, got married, only person ever loved"
"I'm fairly young, junior in high school , but I do not wish to disclose my age. My mom is a hardcore muslim, forcing her religion on me and all my sisters. My sisters are much older than I am...one is addicted to adderall, and two are depressed. I developed a drug and alcohol problem  in sophomore year of high school which escalated very quickly. I even almost overdosed off of a combination of xanax and alcohol.

I used all these drugs and alcohol just because they were fun, not because I was depressed or sad or anything. My alcohol problem climaxed when I almost fought a police officer at a party when I was drunk. This led my mom to making me see a psychologist, and I genuinely felt bad for my substance abuse so I left drinking all at once.

During the summer I became addicted to Xanax because I was terrified of my dad catching me drinking, that I just resorted to Xanax, as it is a cheap drunk. When school started in September, I had minor xanax withdrawal and I felt terrible. I started to drink moderately again.

Just some more background... I feel like my dad genuinely dislikes me, and just tries to hide it up with fake conversations. All my sisters tell me my dad is a psycho when it comes to me. My dad always tries to turn my mom against me, calling me a manipulator and all types of shit. We have a shitty relationship as we aren't even close. My alcohol problem is misleading as I still get good grades in school, and I have very good studying habits. I strive so hard in school because I want to leave my shitty life behind

My life started to spiral out of control fast, and I became depressed, anxious, and restless. I partied every weekend and drank a lot, but my parents wouldn't catch me as I am good at acting sober. I started drinking on weekdays, and I started to feel so lonely. 

I finally met a girl, and not to sound corny, but I genuinely fell in love. She likes me a lot, and she actually makes me happy. For some reason she makes me anxious and restless too, so I started to have a harder drinking problem. I do not know why she gets me so restless, but I do know that it's really fucking us up. Because of my mood swings I always begin to flirt with her, getting her hopes up, and then I suddenly crash and I turn her down. I know I'm hurting her a lot, but I have so much shit going on in my life that it distracts me. I think I don't want to get too close to her for a fear of being left and hurt.

My life became hectic when my mom found beers in my room, and my parents realized my alcohol problem was still present. I know my mom genuinely cares, but her shoving religion in my throat gets me angrier, as I can't have a normal relationship with her because she only talks about school and religion. I know my dad on the other hand does not care about my drinking habit, but just that he wants to shit on me.

We had a family party I had to attend to, and I know this was a poor decision, but me and my family friend drank a little bit. I got breathalyzed by my dad when I came home, and I blew a .04. My dad promised he wouldn't tell my mom if I stopped drinking, and I made a deal. When my mom heard from someone that I was drinking, my dad quickly turned on me and texted my mom discretely about our deal. I confronted my dad and he blatantly lied to my face about it, even deleting the messages off his phone and showing it to me, acting like he never texted my mom. My mom gave up on me and said I was garbage with an alcohol problem, and it actually hurt me deeply

I started drinking even harder as I felt my parents stopped caring for me, and my dad caught me with alcohol again, and they told me to leave the house. I was packing my bags, and my mom gave me a bunch of garbage bags. I was about to leave the house when my mom told me that if I left, I would never be allowed back in. I stayed home, and my mom said I was a disgrace and all that shit. I didn't care what she had to say, but she said I might have to go to rehab

I know I have a drinking problem and a lot of psychological problems, but I think it's best I leave the house for a month. I have many friends houses to stay at, and I have enough money to live away from home for a month. I genuinely want to find peace in my life again, and I am in such a shit hole right now that it hurts to think about. I told my sister about leaving the house, and she never dismissed it, as she was kicked out the house for a month too. Is this the right way to find peace in my life again?

"Hi Im 15 years old and this account is a throwaway for obviouse reasons. Some older boys I barley knew but thought were my friends invited me to a party they were 18 and 19 years old. They got me very drunk everything after that is very blurry. They made me do sexual things at first I was scared because they are bigger than me.

"Okay so this is the story of how I had everything a 19 year could possibly want and how I lost it just as fast. I had everything. I had a loyal gf, I had a good paying job, a car, had lots of friends who I considered ""brothers"", I had a good relationship with my mom and sisters, I was going out every weekend having fun. Everything was perfect. I had never been so happy in my life. I was saving up for a newer car, for college, I was planning lots of great things for myself. I thought maybe I had finally gotten into the right track. I started hanging out with the wrong people though. I knew it was wrong but I didn't think I would ever get caught. We would go out at night and go through people's cars , steal whatever was valuable, credit cards, wallets, purses, electronics, guns, whatever we thought we could get money for. I was going on $1000 shopping sprees. One night I went out by myself and got caught. I was arrested, put in jail for 3 days and then I bonded out. My bond was $13,500 for 5 counts of felony entering auto, and 1 count of prowling. That's when my life flipped upside down. I know i put myself in that situation. I don't blame anyone else. Suddenly I had nothing. My friends I considered ""brothers"" didn't ever call to check up, they weren't even worried. So I had no friends now. No car. No money. (I hired a decent lawyer but she charged $4000). I lost my job in which I had just gotten a raise . I got a new one but it's a job I hate for less the money I was making back then. All my money goes to my lawyer, rent, and bills. I haven't bought myself anything in over 4 months. I'm not a citizen of the United States so if my lawyer can't drop find a way to drop the charges then I'm going to get deported back to Colombia where I was born. I haven't been there in 15 years since I was 4. So now I had the stress of not even knowing if I was going to be able to stay in the country with my mom and 4 sisters. If I was going to be able to stay with my girlfriend. I had no way of seeing her because I didn't have a car, no money to take her out, no friends to go out with. So I started pushing her away, avoiding texts, avoiding calls, avoiding chances to meet up. I knew how much she loved me, she was head over heels, I've never seen someone love me so much. But I didn't want her to fall more and then me get deported. That would have crushed her. So I continued pushing her away, every argument I would suggest breaking up. So one day I just did it , I broke up with her. Blocked her on all social media. I miss her tho but she is already talking to someone else. Now that I'm trying to meet new people I can't seem to be genuinely interested in. What they tell me about them and about their lives. I want to care. But I just don't. I want to be social, and active and positive and all these good things but I just can't. It's always in the back of my head. A little voice telling me, what's the point of getting to know them, what's the point of texting them back ? You're going to get deported in a couple months anyways. I talk to a girl for 1-2 days and then I stop talking to them all together . I don't even find joy in things that I used to love, like soccer , I tell myself what's the point in going. To go play if you're gonna get deported in a couple months. I want to be able to live productively , positively, I want to just live but this court case is holding me back. The thought of this impending doom in holding me back and I'm letting life pass in front of me. Idk what to do.

"Hi everyone, I should've done a throw away account. 

I found this subreddit recently and I'm not sure where to start exactly. Not sure if this is even the right place. I just have this feeling of general loss, I'm 22 turning 23 in June. I live at home with my dad, I have no idea where my mom is, and that's fine. My parents went through a 8+ year divorce and I think it messed me up. I was 8 at the time, my mother was incredibly abusive to us. I still remember her choking my sister over the bathroom tub. It's something I don't think I'll ever forget. I spent those 8 years constantly moving from house to house apartment to apartment. I finally just stopped unpacking my things 

I was always described as the happy kid. Of course I was happy, I was fat as fuck. I had to smile or I probably would've killed myself in middle school, I certainly told myself enough times I was going to. Kids are fucking ruthless. I think it's fair to say I cried a lot up until high school. I lost that weight in high school, busted my ass and made something of myself. But now all I ever hear is how I'm not happy and that everyone misses the dacotah that was happy. I think they really just miss the dacotah that they could pick on without repercussions. I'm not sure how to feel about it all, if I'm not expressing a feeling of loss I just feel numb.

 I have problems expressing myself, or so I'm told. My college roommates used to call me emotionally detached. My girlfriend at the time thought so too, eventually they all just pushed me out of their life. I spent the 2nd half of the year alone in my dorm. 

I've never had the heart to call somebody out on their shit or get mad at somebody. I just end up mad at myself and wishing for that brief moment of misery to be over. My girlfriend, god bless her, has been supportive through these last couple months but she doesn't fully get it, and I don't know if I could ever explain it all. I love her to death and I hate the look on her face when I'm upset, nobody should ever have to worry about me.

In the 5 or 6 years since my sister ran away I have done nothing but watch my father fall into a pit of alcoholism. He's pushed everyone away from him and his problems only get thrown or deflected on me. He blames me for all of his misery, the divorce, the money. Which of course only opens opportunities for me to get confronted further. He would bitch me out and threaten to kick my ass, he'd pass out and I'd pick him up.  He'll apologize the next morning say he didn't mean it and do it again the next week. He actually did this again recently, he apologized but I've never wanted to be further from him. I'm not sure if he even remembers what all he has said. I haven't had the heart to tell him all the disgusting things he's said to me but it's really killing me knowing how he really feels. 

I know how to play instruments and I don't consider myself an idiot, I'm sure I have some smarts. I was always a busy person, writing for blogs, testing supplements for muscle tech, playing shows or just general choir engagements. I work for a cleaner service currently and I'm miserable. I thought working with things instead of people would help me. Instead I spend my time sweating my ass off while my 50 something coworker just supervises and judges everything I do.

"The last few years of my life have been really difficult for me. I've been dealing with a couple sexual assaults that all happened during the last 5 years. And its just really bad timing because these past few years were supposed to be me learning how to adult and shit. So instead of learning how to cook chicken or graduate college, I've been sleeping a lot, smoking weed. Trying, failing, and succeeding at coping.

Anyways. My parents do everything they can for me, but they have their own problems too and they aren't the most educated or successful people in the world (career and finances- strictly speaking). So sometimes I get a bit frustrated with them. So a couple weeks into December, and my mom tells me I have to sign up for healthcare because they are dropping me from their plan. I applied quick, but I guess since it was so close to the deadline and lots of others are doing the same, the state still hasn't followed up with me. (I was notified that I qualified, and that the next step would be to wait for a rep to contact me). 

My therapist will be back from vacation next week and I've been hanging on a thread without her. But I just realized that I might not be able to have an appointment with her if I don't have health insurance.

So right now I'm kind of in a pre panic attack state. Typing this all out kind of helped in a weird way. 

Thank you for listening, I hope it makes more sense than I think it does.",1,"dealing with couple of sexual assaults, sleeping a lot smoking weed, trying ,failing, succeding at coping, therapist onvacation"
"I hope someone reads this. It's just a rant, but I need to say it, put it out there into the universe.  
  
I moved out of home at 18, and now I'm 20. I live with my sister in a different state, because I used to get on with her. But now she has turned into a different person since I was hospitalised for depression and suicide attempts last year - I think it's because I am a reminder of the terrible and abusive childhood the children of my family experienced, and my sister is in denial about it effecting her. She is cruel and angry towards me. My whole family think I'm overreacting/lying because that is  what fits in with their denial.  
  
I was so desperate for some understanding that I booked flights back to my moms house for two weeks over the holidays. I'm one week in and my PTSD and anxiety have been getting progressively out of control since arriving. My family don't respect my personal space, they touch me unexpectedly which is a major fear for me and when I tell them I'd rather they didn't do that, they just laugh and keep going. Every time someone touches me I feel an overwhelming nausea and desire to cry or act violently towards them. Even my 4 year old niece, who I love and does not mean anything by her touches. I know they're trying to protect themselves by acting like my problems are not real, but I can't handle it. We all went through the abuse, why am I the only one facing it (and therefore suffering from it)?  
 
  
I have 6 days until my flight back home, and 1 day after that is my psychiatrist appointment, which I'm hanging out for. I feel like my greatest need is to be accepted into a different family, just for a year until I can get over the worst of this. My psychiatrist and my psychologist are my only friends and it sounds sad but that's how it is. I don't trust anyone else not to hurt me somehow.  
   
I don't know what to do. I'm so alone, and so overwhelmed. I'm trying not to be hurt by my family because they're just protecting themselves from reminders of the past. they will have to face the trauma at some point too. But I feel like I need to cut them off from my life completely for a few years until I'm stronger.  
  
I'm just so scared all the time here, so filled with dread and fear and anxiety. I want to have a family that loves me and listens. My own family is toxic, full of monsters and damaged people. I'm still just a little kid inside, and I'm not capable of doing this on my own. The trauma work with my psychiatrist is slow going because I'm so damaged, and react intensely to the slightest reminders. The nightmares have been constant this past week and I can't afford to change my flight home to sometime sooner.  
  
How do I do this? How do you guys manage? I want a hug and someone to tell me it's all going to be ok.

"Over the last year I have felt like my life was just getting worse and worse. I left my fiance in November of 2015, which is a long story but it boils down to I always felt like I was never enough in her eyes. I felt like she was emotionally abusive, so I left. For a time I seemed to be happy. I had just gotten out of the military (note this story has nothing to do with trauma from the military) and I moved back to my home town so I could finally see my friends and family regularly again. All seemed like it was going well. I got a job at the local hospital, I'm currently living with my sister so that's helping with money. I just feel like I'm a shell of the person I was before I met my Ex. I don't know how to be happy anymore and I don't even remember what it feels like to experience true elation for something. I use to love writing or reading, I can barely do both anymore. This is the most I've written, and meant it, in a long time. I took some of those online tests, just a minute ago, to tell me if it was possible that I was depressed. Everyone of them said, ""You are likely Severely Depressed"". This feels like I'm just ranting but I needed to tell someone this and this seemed like the only spot to put this down.",1,"left fiance , she was emotionally abusive, moved back to home town, living with sister, shell of my forme self due to ex."
"I'm am a 15 year old male who has depression. I been bullied throughout my life, ignored, look down upon, and even laughed at for being stupid. Depression has taken a lot on me and I can't deal with it anymore. People I try to talk to at school just ignore me or talk to my so called friends around me who also ignored me, and it just makes me filled with rage, sadness, and envy. I helped those people in the past and they don't repay me back. I sit alone at lunch, and basically just a loner in general. My family doesn't know I have depression and I don't want to tell them because it will make them sad and I love them.I will probably  kill myself later this year, or during the school year and see how much they care.( Probly won't), but hey, at least I'm passing my classing with a, and b's. All I'm asking for is friendship or just to be happy, or at least an aquatience. I have to go to school in a little but I haven't gone to sleep. Well fuck me, I guest I'm just a boring, ugly, stupid person. Probably  will just stay in sick I guess.

"The more I sit back and think. The more I realize that I'll never recover from the psychological damage both high school and college have caused me.

People were just downright awful to me in high school. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused by shit heads that live in my neighborhood. It's like there mission was to make my life miserable. They ruined my life in every way. They posted humiliating pictures of me online. They beat me up whenever they feel like it. They called me horrible names. You name it they did it. 

My senior year prom date was a complete bitch. She didn't talk to me for the entire night and abandoned me for her friends. Literally everything was perfect we talked every day, I asked her to prom. Then it all went downhill. She never acknowledged me presence in school. She was so rude to me on prom night. I regret following her around like I was some stupid sheep. Should have just left her. I recently snapped and got really mad at her when we didn't talk for awhile. I let her have it and I feel no remorse that I lashed out on her. She deserved it with the hell she put me through. She broke my heart and ruined my prom night. Something I'll never get back.

I had no friends in high school. People would just ignore me. Never asked me for plans. They were all just fake ass people. They always talked to people that were better then me. I was always a second choice. Not even a fucking second choice. 

High school set the stages and fucking destroyed any positive view I have on people. I often stormed out of classes and broke down crying in the guidance office because of how I was treated. Nobody gave a shit. I was sent home one day after having a complete meltdown, throwing a tissue box at my counselor, crying, and getting so mad to the point I almost passed out. I literally hate people. All I have done was be friendly to them and they have to treat me like shit in return. People did some nasty things to me and I was suicidal. Now I come out of high school with an extremely hateful view on people my age. I wanted friends and I still want friends, but literally me getting friends is just super unlikely. So I just sit back and watch the others have fun while I rot.

College? Heh, people told me college would be different. My parents made me go to my local community college and that decision fucked over any chance of me having a normal college social life. I'm mad at my parents to this day for not letting me go to a college I wanted to go to. Now I'll never get to experience the joys of living in a dorm and I don't have any friends for an apartment. I hate college. Nobody at my college talks to each other. It's antisocial and I'm often sitting alone or walking alone. Nobody talks to me. I even approach people in class, nobody talks to me.

Now a little bit about myself. I'm extremely shy. Yes, I've gotten better at it but honestly, this doesn't make a difference because I even talked to people and they still wouldn't act like I'm there.

I also am not much of a partier. I hate parties and I just hate being around drugs and alcohol. It just isn't my kind of fun and I always stay away from it.

Literally laying here in my bed crying which I have been for the last fucking week. I don't have a therapist appointment till Friday. My therapist is too busy to talk too. I honestly don't think I'll make it to Friday. I am becoming suicidal again and I just don't see a point in living through these awful college + high school years. Even if I make it, I'm so psychologically fucked up from high school and college that it will impact me in the future. I don't want to live anymore. I just want to be happy again and sadly I think ending it is the only way as I can't get anything going for me.",1,"never recover from psychological damage from school and college,abused physically, emotionally and mentally in neighbourhood, senior year porn date abandoned me , rude on prom night, no friends in high school"
"Hello!
This is my first post on Reddit. English is not my native tongue so bare with me.

My mom and dad molested me from 0-18 years old. My dad got me pregnant at the age of 11. We went abroad and I had an abortion. When I was younger (before I hit puberty) they sold me to other men and allowed them to use me as they pleased for a night, sometimes a whole weekend. 

At 18 I got a good job and moved far away from them. Now I'm 23 and my life is very good. I married the man of my dreams and together we have a 1 year old kid. I know I should be happy but I always feel depressed and anxious. I have flashbacks everyday and nightmares every night. 

I'm starting a ptsd program with a therapist tomorrow and to be honest I don't want to go - I'm really scared. I don't know what will happen when I start talking about everything that happened when I was a kid.
I feel like my childhood was just too messed up and I will never get over it. I'm so tired of the flashbacks and the nightmares. I have too many bad memories. I don't want to live like this, I can't live like this. 

Do you think I can get over this and be normal?

"I posted on suicide a couple of minutes ago. I really dont know i am gonna kill myself but surely not today, theres an overwhelming feeling of numbness inside me and i feel like i am nothing really.
I take medication for depression over 16 years now. Five years ago i started taking meds also for anxiety. I have an eating disorder for also nearly 16 years. I feel low and like if i was completely worthless.
I have conquered many battles in my life, sexual abuse by relative and school peers, drug addiction and acute self harming. Ive had awful relationships where i guess i was trying to fill the emotional void my father left inside my soul. The father of my child was abusive and an alcoholic and a drug addict. He got over his issues and is really a changed man and we get along fine. I still feel bad for not making us work or succeed. Like many things in my life, it was a huge failure. Ive tried practically everything to feel better, excersise, therapy, talking with friends etc, but now i have hit a low point in my life and i dont know really if i can recover.
I started a new relationship almost a year ago, i am in love with this man and i suffer every day. He is perfect, professional and amazing. He is bit older than me. He is cold and hot with me every month and shuts me down every now and then. Ive done everything to make it work but he has left me again and now for good. I cant believe its over. I gave my heart and soul to this relationship and now its done. I loved him and gave him everything he needed. Now he hates me and has blocked me from everything while i beg for him to come back. One week ago he told me he loved me and gave me a beautiful ring, now im devastated and alone.
I take care of my mother and child. I have a decent job and no financial worries atm.
I feel like the worst mother on earth, like scum and i really want to die at moments and have attempted numerous times. 
I feel lost and that everyone would be better off without me. I look at the subway rails and think if i will have the courage, i cut from time to time and beg to have the courage to press down hugely on to the blade, stand infront of avenues and think of jumping infront of a bus...
I feel like giving up and that everything i have tried and fought for has been worthless, like me, cos in reality im just a piece of shit.
I really dont know what to do...

"This is going to long guys..sorry. I've been a long time lurker and I've never posted. I've read all of your posts, shared tears and smiles with things that I identify with. It makes me feel both sad and happy to know I'm not alone. I've been depressed since I could remember. I used to be a happy and positive little girl until the first time I was bullied. Since, I've been bullied and made to feel like shit from so many people in my life. My low self-esteem began maybe when I was 6? I've been struggling with life since. I'm 25 and I haven't finished my degree. Why? Because I can't make myself do the work. I get motivated for the first month and say this year will be different and I fucking fall into depression again and I can't get out. I fear falling behind and when I do I fucking give up. I will get my degree this spring (finally). I've had to get academic withdrawals because of my depression. I feel like a failure while all the people I know are flourishing. My life needs to change.

I told my mom today that I want to make an appointment with a psychiatrist so I can get meds. I've depressed my entire life...and I've tried to deal with it but my life is shit and I know something needs to change. I called and made an appointment and I'm fucking scared. I don't want to talk to someone who will be internally judging my fucked up decisions and life. 

Then my mom has been acting bummed and I asked why. She said she doesn't understand. Her and my dad have given me all they could and it doesn't make sense why I'm sad. She's now sad and blaming herself. I've tried to tell them it's not their fault and they don't get it. I can't talk to them. 

I can't talk to my boyfriend. We've been together for seven years. We met in college and I was better with my depression and actually socialized. But the years carried on and he graduated and we've been long distance since. I lost my friends because they betrayed me or just found me so boring. My best friend stopped talking to me when I got a senator internship over her congressman one. She just stared at me when I told her and neither she or her family congratulated me. She stopped talking to me since then. That was three years ago. She was my last friend. Sine then, I don't hang out with anyone, except my boyfriend when he visits. We've been long distance for the last five years but after my best friend left me, I've been so alone. 

My boyfriend is the opposite of me. In college and after, he's that guy everyone loves. He can make friends with a freaking tree. He attracts people and he has many friends and is social. I'm the complete opposite. He has to beg to get me to come out with him and his friends, and if I do i always have to drink. It's the only way I can talk and not just sit their silent. He's seen me when I'm so depressed that I can't even get out of bed. The last year has been horrible for me. I've spent weeks just in bed... and I can tell he's getting tired of it. 

He keeps saying I bring up the past and the pain I've endured and I can't let things go. I want to I just don't know how. I don't trust people and I don't know how to carry on conversations anymore. I feel resentful he's so social and well liked. When I'm alone watching TV like any other fucking day, he's out and having fun. I want to but I can't. 

For New Years Eve, I saw he was with people (mostly girls) and I texted him saying ""are you spending new years with girls??"" He just said. ""not one, there are some here but I'm not with them."" I told him to ""well have fun."" He didn't call to say HNY or hasn't talked to me since. 

The past four days I had another depressive ""bender."" I just cried, slept, and stared at my ceiling. I couldn't even watch tv. I just go some motivation to do some shit. 

I'm hoping seeing the psychiatrist will help and I can get ADD and Anti-Depressants. Shit needs to change. 

I've just been writing down my thoughts. Sorrry this is so long. This is just 10% of what I wish I could say but I don't want to write a freaking 100 page essay.





",1,"depressed, bullied, low self-esteem, withdrawal from college,parents acting bummed, boyfriend mad"
"I was starting to feel low and burn out before New Years, and the evening allowed me to rise above my subjective perspective of myself and my interactions with people. I usually try not to party too hard *nudge nudge*, but it was a net positive I think. I reevaluated how I was doing and got a more complete view of psychological state.

I was also really happy to feel comfortable and actually see (as opposed to view a person through my preconceived notion) people a little more than I usually am able to.

Gender and Sexuality
===============
I grew up in a conservative environment, but I actually never felt ashamed of my gender or ashamed of my sexuality. I would get boy and girl crushes all the time and think nothing of it other than, ' oh this person is so cool and I really want to get to know them'. I was more effeminate and got bullied for it, including authority figures turning a blind eye or encouraging it. Pretty lame times that reinforced that people can be savage.

In expression and identity, I guess I was pretty androgynous growing. I never felt like I was a woman or that I wanted to be a manly man. I thought the gender binary people expressed themselves in was narrow and boring, so I kind of made a point to disregard it. 

Unfortunately, I have also learned that some people will not let you survive or function without expressing yourself in a way that they seem fit. I've experienced way too many people being openly hostile because of my mere existence. Today, I have to role-play as a bro just to survive in many professional environments. It feels degrading to my soul, but the trade off is I have some money. Its a bit emotionally exhausting and doesn't feel nice.

All in all, I am bi and not too happy with the prejudices people have in the world.


Socialization
==============
I am used to compartmentalizing my feelings. I have lost a great deal of friends who had either fallen off the face of the earth, OD'd, killed themselves, or had been too much grief to keep in contact with. I am craving close relationships and self-growth, but I am finding it difficult to meaningfully connect with people. I wonder if the feeling of abandoning other people because it is easier than being abandoned comes into play for me right now. I've felt that way in the past, but I thought I got over it. 

I am going to school and have had gainful employment, but it doesn't help me connect in the ways I seek. I socialize and feel like I am role-playing. Many friendships with people seem superficial and unfulfilling, and these are typically with normalish people. I don't have a problem putting myself 'out there' if I'm not down and out in a low period. I am social and have been told I am easy going and funny just as often as I've been told I can come across as a bitch without intending to or even saying anything (hah).

Despite what other people seem to think, I usually feel on-guard and can hardly be intimate / open up to folks. I think my memory is eroding due to long-term stress. What good is living life and collecting lessons from experiences if you can't remember them? What good is gaining perspective if you just lose it in a time of need? 

I'm uneasy not knowing people's motivations. I try to learn about people and what they want from me in an attempt to predict what may happen. 


Relationships
===============
I don't feel like I need to be in a relationship, but I do know that I need meaningful relationships. Although, it would be nice to find someone romantically that sees me for who I am and empowers me. Obviously, I have my doubts that I'll let anyone close enough to get the chance though.

Current partner was raised by a narcissist and is emotionally unavailable in a similar way as me. It is a comfortable yet emotionally unfulfilling relationship. I guess we're together out of a mutual need for physical intimacy and care? We care for each other, and she's incredibly gifted and into really cool stuff. We both value our space apart too due to similar issues.


The abridged version of my life:
================
As a child, I was very depressed due to life circumstances out of my control. Many of the relatives that I was close to straight up died, moved away, or quit speaking to me due to my parents' issues.

My parents made very unwise mistakes, fought often, and were not emotionally empowering. Purposefully went out of my way to not pick up their habits. Kind of felt a low-level mistrust of people since childhood due to bullying from other kids and abuse from authority figures. I liked books way more than people and read a lot. Most of my role-models were dead white guys haha.

High school was better, smoked weed and did somewhat engaging things with friends. Urban exploring, clubbing, extracurriculars, art, etc.

In spite of my world sucking, I was pretty motivated to leave and made decent grades. I qualified for a bunch of academic scholarships and went overseas. Found out the home was being foreclosed and the cars repossessed about midway through my year abroad. Traveled as much as I could and tried to not think too hard about returning to a state of no opportunities. Kinda spiraled into depression after realizing how good I was living abroad and how I would likely not see my new friends again.

At 16 I was thrust out into the world alone, ended up with little to no social supports or family due to my sexuality. It was also easier for my parents since they were struggling to get back on their own feet. Went around with a traveler friend I had made, riding trains and getting into trouble. Watched my travel buddy die of a heroin OD. Wound up in an abusive relationship on the coast. Pimped by someone older than me that I had been dating, experienced extreme stress and trauma due to some pretty bad influences in my life and feeling like there was no way out.

Eventually distanced myself from most of these horrible people, but I went through a period of agoraphobia where I wouldn't leave my apartment even if I ran out of food. Routinely disassociated and felt unable to connect to people.

Went on anti-psychotics for treatment resistant depression, basically strung out of my mind on benzos most of the day. Ditched the psych-meds and started meditating, doing shrooms, gradually meeting people. Got somewhat better, but I lost memories and cognitive functioning as a side effect of the anti-psychotics and benzos. Eventually returned to baseline (I think). Enrolled at a nearby school.

Started dating a guy who was diagnosed with NPD and in the marine corps. At first, his confidence and arrogance was endearing, and he was on frequent deployments which meant that we really valued the time we had together. Felt like I had a home for the first time in my life and actually loved. He was emotionally withdrawn, and I was also emotionally messed up to an extent. It worked out well enough. Was making a decent amount of money doing online stock trading and investing as well as taking classes online.

We would talk about our perspectives of the world. Goals. Ways to achieve our dreams. I designed our apartment and basically took care of his cats. Although I paid half the rent, I was kind of like expected to be a live-in nanny which wasn't too weird considering the shit I had gone through in life so far. He was a dom and we were both poly, so he would date basically my female-equivalent clones and we'd have threesomes (I would usually have shortish platinum blond haircuts and so would they). FWIW the sex with him pretty great even though he was kind of a sociopath.

After his contract with the military ended and he felt somewhat aimless, he began to cycle through emotions quickly and decided I wasn't worth his time. Literally a week after professing an extreme amount of love for me that he never felt before. He once described loving people like he would love eating a candy bar. That I had never done anything good for him. Really felt mind fucked - this wasn't a naive first relationship sorta deal. I even went with him to meet his parents once. It seriously felt like a deep relationship up until that point. 

Moved with friends to the bay, so did he. After a 6 month period of lackluster dating, we began an on and off again fuck-buddy relationship with that same guy. We agreed it would be purely physical, but he was trying to cross my boundaries. Eventually, I asked him to stay out of my life entirely. He told he had raped me after I passed out from GHB one evening bwfore either of us moved to the bay. I remember the incident vaguely, but I never opened my eyes and so just left it up to being something I imagined. Really screwed with me.

Best friend at the time was dating my partner, they ended up doing meth and being dicks. I cut them out of my life after they stoles from me. Not so funnily enough, my current best friend is being weird with my current partner - has been rejected by her and feels dissatisfied in his dating life. I feel like there is resentment being directed at me  and things are compounding on top of it. Too emotionally stressed to deal with it, so I am giving him space for awhile.

Had a crazy housemate situation where a couple made living at my space unbearable for me and 3 other housemates. We were all on the lease and couldn't evict them. I was stressed 100% of the time and never knew what they would do next. Can't really relax there even though they've been gone.

I am ashamed of what I have been through, but I try not to blame myself entirely for my life circumstances. A life without self-expression and enjoyment isn't a life worth living. I am sick of only surviving. I know something is wrong, but I don't have the tools to identify and fix it.

I've seen 6 different therapists - all ended up being useless, clueless, or offensive. Struggling to find a quality low income psych or therapists, but I am asking around.


*My living situation is tenuous and there is no long-term guarantee of housing. I also live in an extremely expensive area, and I don't have any social supports outside of here. Kind of feel trapped by this. 


Current thoughts
==============
I don't want to live a fear based lifestyle. 

I'd like to think that with all of my life experiences and trauma, I am not a complete basket case. I think I work much harder than most people to hold myself together. My worst fear is that I will become an emotionally reactive monster and permanently lose sight of the humanity of others. That my ability to rationalize and integrate my experiences will be lost forever. That I will be a scared, closed off, zombie for the rest of my life. It's really unnerving.

I've made so much progress over the last 5ish years to reach a point of relative stability, but it doesn't seem to be enough. I can't continue to expend so much energy on getting by. It's chipping at my will to live. With that being said, I'm not planning to make rash decisions. 


Some problems I have
==============
*Moody

*Typically pretty tense

*Tend to feel a level of stress at all times

*burn out after period of high stress leading to being withdrawn / unmotivated

*Have to fake being relaxed to interact with people in high stress periods (lots of projects, midterms/finals, relationship stuff)

*Memory is worsening

*Sometimes memories are hard to put in chronological order, not impossible - but it takes actual effort to piece together

*Sleep not restful

*Expect the worse from people, but I try to give them opportunities to prove me wrong 

*Sometimes impulsive when depressed, but I work pretty hard to control this - used to be caught up by by life's wayward distractions instead of introspecting 

*Sometimes experience anhedonia

*ADHD may be related

*Funnily enough, I don't feel safe being emotional around people sometimes",1,"grew up in conservative environment, bullied for being effiminate, mocked for androgynous growing, parents figth, no friends, current partner emotionally unavailable"
"So my mum was 17 and moved out of her parents house, she got married to the first guy she met. He went to prison 2 months later and she had nowhere to go except back home. Her parents told her she couldn't come back unless she got divorced and so she did. Then a friend of hers tells her they know someone who has a house that is empty and has power. So she decides to go squat there. Well apparently the guy who was staying there was in jail. he gets out and they start living together. They have sex and she gets pregnant with me. Around the same time she's seeing the type of person he really is. She's pregnant and he wants to get pitbulls and he is training them to be fighting dogs. He takes her cat and feeds it to the dogs to rile them up. He beats her a lot. He kills her pets. One day the dog poop on the floor and he beats her with the shower rod and makes her eat the dog poop. Luckily she doesn't loose me as she is about 7 months pregnant. One of his friends comes over and helps her leave and my father accuses her of cheating. She wasn't cheating, even though Casey was in love with her and thats why he helped her. Im about 10 months old and she steals a dog from a man who was abusing it. She goes to jail for like 2 days. When she gets home, my father hadn't even as so much as changed my diaper. He was passed out drunk. Fast forward to when I am 3. She finally leaves him after he points a crossbow at me. After that she gets married and my step dad is strict but im also spoiled. We had money and a farm and my mum is the perfect mum and houseswife. When I am 10 she has an affair with the neighbor and gets pregnant. Tells her husband and he says she needs to get an abortion or he is leaving. so she gets an abortion and he leaves anyway. They get divorced and she gives up the house and everything we have. The farm and all the animals and our pets and we move up north. Im home alone almost every night so i eat dinner at the neighbors and she's always either working or at the bar. dating several different men and never home. She meets a guy and I didnt like him from the start. he used to steal money from her. He actually had a girlfriend he lived with and was having a baby with and she didnt seem to care. while he was having sex with multiple women. he gave me the creeps though and when i told my mum she said i was being a brat because i was mad about the divorce. when i am 12 they have 2 kids together and we have no power in our house in the middle of winter. my brothers are a year old and a newborn at this time. I cannot shower because the water is too cold in the house. So I take showers at school trying to hurry before anyone gets there. the school counselor keeps giving me clothes and its embarrassing. I run away from home and get caught immediately. Get the shit beat out of me. My mum accuses me of having sex with someone i was friends with. at this point ive never even kissed a boy. she's calling me a slut and throws me into the doorway and i cut my nose on a loose nail she says i hurt myself on purpose. Then we end up moving again because she says im going to get her arrested. im 13 and i am getting bad grades at my new school. she beats me with a studded belt all over my body and shaves all my hair off. I tell the school counselor and they do nothing about it. That summer i find out i failed 7th grade. and the beats me with the handle side of a fly swatter. the next day she screams at me that someone is coming over and ""why the f*ck are you wearing short sleeves?"" And i get beat again. I run away that night. I get a ride from a random guy and ask him to take me to the sheriffs dept. he lets me stay the night since it is so late and the next day he takes me. I tell them and I go into foster care. My mum tells them i am lying and that I am mad because I can't go out and have sex. Which is absurd. I end up with a foster family, they are religious. They do not like my alternative/dark style and so after 3 months I am sent to a new home.  The new foster family is an old couple. they have 2 other teenage girls who are 4 years older than me. The one they considered a daughter and she had been living with them since she was like 6. She hated me. I dunno why. But she was always so mean to me and treated me like crap. Well the old lady didn't seem to like me either. So the girl I shared a room with was the only one I had to talk to. One day a cupcake is missing from the kitchen and I get blamed for it. But I did not eat it. I get screamed at and then I go to school. After school my social worker picks me up and says that Im going to a new home. Im at the new home with the same girl who i shared a room with. She's a bit of a sl*t and is always getting me in trouble. And my depression gets really bad. I start cutting myself. When I go to school one of my friends see's my arm and tells the teacher. I'm sent to a mental health facility and am there for a year and a half. one day my social worker says If I do not go back to my parents I have to stay at the facility until I am 18. So I go back to them. A few months pass and after my final meeting with my counselor my parents decide we are moving. when we move, they do not put me back in school. They tell me I am going to be homeschooled. So I now am officially not allowed to leave the house at all. a few months pass and we are homeless. so my mums husband buys a crappy camper and we live in an rv park. i have to sleep in a tent tho. during hurricane season. the tent doesnt do good for keeping me dry at night. so i just get used to it. This goes on for 10 months and one day my step dad tries to rape me. when i tell my mum she says its my fault because i am a sl*t. We move into a house. I try to run away again but i cant. a month passes and they are drunk. they come into my room and he takes my clothes off and she holds me down. then i start crying. they stop and go to bed. the next morning she says if i ever tell anyone she will kill me. When I am 17, she leaves him and says she will make things right with me. but then goes back to him 2 months later. When i am 18 I meet a guy and he helps me run away. I'm with him and he is obsessive and he takes my phone away and accuses me of cheating. I'm with him 24/7. the last straw was when he hit me. so i meet another guy on CL and leave. I fall in love with him and right before Christmas he leaves me. I go back to my mums because i have nowhere to go now and she tries to take my phone of which i pay for. She won't let me leave the house and makes me cancel dates. I have to run away again. I backpack for a few months and end up in the west. Then I meet a guy on Facebook who I share mutual friends with. We hit it off and I move back to the south and we have been together since.
