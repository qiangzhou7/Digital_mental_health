But I can't, because I have to keep going for my family, for my friends, for myself. So I put on a fake smile and pretend like everything is okay, even though it's not. And that's the hardest part of all - feeling like I'm living a lie, like I'm trapped in this never-ending cycle of sadness and despair. But I know I can't give up, no matter how hard it gets.
