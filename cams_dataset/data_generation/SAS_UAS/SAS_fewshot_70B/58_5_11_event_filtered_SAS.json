This kind of thinking can worsen mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety, and it does not encourage individuals to seek help or take action to change the situation.\nInstead, it is more beneficial to focus on developing a growth mindset and learning helplessness, which involves recognizing that events are not necessarily reflective of one's inherent nature or abilities but rather can be influenced by external factors, and that there are steps that can be taken to improve the situation."
