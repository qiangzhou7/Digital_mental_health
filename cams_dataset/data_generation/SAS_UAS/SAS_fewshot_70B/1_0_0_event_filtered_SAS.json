        "Post": "\"I had a wake-up call today when I almost choked on my lunch. It made me realize how short and fragile life is, and how we should cherish every moment.\"\n\nIn this post, the individual attributes the cause of their near-death experience to the fragility of life.

By acknowledging the fragility of life, the individual demonstrates a long-lasting explanation for the event, which fits the criteria for SAS."

I'm determined to turn my life around in 2018 because I know I have the power to change my own story.\"\n\nThis post attributes the cause of the event (feeling dreadful) to a stable attributional style (the person's own power to change their story).
