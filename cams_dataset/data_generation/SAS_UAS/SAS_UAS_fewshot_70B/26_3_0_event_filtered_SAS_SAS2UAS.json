This change in attributional style suggests that the individual is not inherently flawed, but rather facing challenges that can be overcome with time and effort."

Instead, research suggests that individuals with a stable attributional style are more likely to experience depression and anxiety due to their tendency to attribute negative events to stable causes.\n\nAdditionally, it is crucial to recognize that converting attribution styles without addressing the underlying issues may not be effective in reducing depressive symptoms. It is essential to address the root cause of the problem and provide support and resources to individuals struggling with mental health issues."
