I've lost people I care about because of my anxiety and depression, and I've ruined relationships due to panic attacks and saying things I don't mean. I feel like a terrible person, and I don't know how to change it. I've even started hanging out with people I don't really like just to avoid being alone. My parents don't understand what I'm going through, and it feels like they don't believe me when I tell them I have no friends. I want to get off these meds and start fresh, but it's hard when I feel so hopeless and like my life is already over at 23.\"",

        "Post": "\"I'm always feeling anxious and depressed, and I can't seem to shake off these negative emotions no matter how hard I try. I just want to enjoy life and be happy, but it seems like that's impossible for me. I've tried seeing psychologists and therapists, but their help hasn't been much use. I've even resorted to taking Paxil, but it doesn't seem to do anything for my depression. On top of all this, I have cholinergic urticaria, which makes me break out in hives whenever I get nervous or anxious. It's a never-ending cycle of misery for me. My goal is to one day find a girlfriend and work from home making YouTube videos, but my severe depression and anger make it hard for me to even think about those things, let alone achieve them.\"",
