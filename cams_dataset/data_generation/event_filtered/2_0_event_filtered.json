        "Origin_reddit": "I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tired of worrying my friends and loved ones by posting things where they can see them so I just made this account to talk here. Talk of self harm to follow, sorry. Also it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of my life story lol.\n\nI started thinking about killing or hurting myself in high school- the summer between freshman and sophomore year I just took a fucking nosedive. I totally retreated into my head, cut off every friend I had made my first year besides literally two. I took an exacto knife from art class and started cutting my hips (because no one would see them there.) The only person who saw was my best friend while I was changing at her house. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not someone who shows a lot of emotion, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never heard her gasp like that or seen her as shocked and hurt as I did right then. To this day, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only person who knows I do that. (Also, somehow, she was willing to date me and we are still together 7 years later.) \n\nI barely passed high school (I think the only reason I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to summer school is because they literally forgot about me.) I remember once admitting to the guidance counselor I hurt myself, and it was a huge force of effort for me to admit that. All she said was \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and I never saw her again. I have no idea why I told her and not the actual therapist I was seeing at the time. The therapist might have done something. \n\nThen I tried college. I somehow go into a decent art school. My freshman year was absolutely fucking miserable. No friends (well, one, but we never did anything besides hang out in our rooms), horrible roommate, tanking grades. I just stopped showing up to class at one point near the end of the year because I knew it was pointless. The small scholarship I had somehow managed to get (which I think was just a result of me coming from an inner city school) was taken away within the first semester. I had just thought I might not have been able to do traditional school, but maybe I would do well in art school. Clearly, I was wrong. Obviously I dropped out. I told my parents I was taking a gap year but...lol. We all knew it was a lie. Three years later and I have zero plans to go to any college at all. \n\nI constantly make jokes about me dropping out around my friends and parents. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always done that; deflecting my pain with humor. I guess I think if I joke about it enough it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stop hurting so much. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even harder is I am still close friends with my one college friend- and they are graduating in a few months from what I view as my biggest failure. \n\nAll my friends are going to college and doing well. My girlfriend is getting an accelerated master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very school smart and has always done very well. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going with her to a networking party in a month or so as her plus one- I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to support her but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to start crying being surrounded by all these successful people because I know I will never be that. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so scared I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to drag her down for the rest of her life. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so smart and driven and is going to be very successful and I am going to work a shitty retail job like I have now for the rest of my life. I know she loves me but every time she tries to compliment me and tell me that I have value I just get angry because I feel like she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just saying that. My brain shuts down when people try to talk to me about my future because I can barely picture myself being alive tomorrow, let alone in a few years. \n\nI never cut every day, just when I was feeling intense emotional pain that needed to be let out somehow. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never made it a full year without doing it- but some years I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone 6 or 7 months without. But lately I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been thinking about it constantly. I just keep a knife in my room now for easy access. I had a party with several friends last week. After they all left, I felt lower than I had in months. It was Christmas Eve, and I was just lying in bed sobbing and bleeding from my hips. I have several plans for events and trips in january- and yet I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get excited for them or feel anything at all. I feel like things are going to get very bad for me (even worse than they have been) very soon. And the worst part is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost a comforting thought.  \n",

My life is s complete mess atm and I don't know what to do.\n\nLong story short, I'm 20 years old uninteresting guy, whose future has no purpose at all. I've never had a girlfriend, I'm studying a degree I don't like all and I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, with minimal chances for getting better.\n\nIt all started when I was 15. I went to the hospital because I thought I was having some sort of heart attack. After many cardiac exams, I was later diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder. Although, the fear of dying still haunts me constantly. \n\n Due to this fact and some other conditions, my grades started  gradually decreasing. At the moment, I'm at the 3rd year of my graduation, studying retail management at a small university. I hate the subjects I'm studying. Every time I wake up and think about needing to the classes, I get more and more demotivated. Needless to say I already failed several subjects and my grades are shit. I can't see myself doing this professionally, but it's too late to give up now, my parents paid for 3 years of studying and I can't disappoint them and waste their money completely. Back in days, I really like Informatics Engineering and Psychology, but due to my awful high school performance, my grades weren't high enough to ingress in any of these graduations. \n\nMy only interests now are music, sports betting, writing, photography and videogames, but there's no real way I could make money and live on that. My self-esteem is as low as it can be, no girl seems to find interest in me. I might be really ugly or I lack some serious social skills. I can count my friends with a single hand, and we usually spend most of the times playing videogames, so I don't go out that much. I find to make a good first impression sometimes, but then I always screw everything up. The only things keeping me on track are drinking, smoking, gambling and occasionally doing drugs.\n\nI wish I had the guts to pack my things up and start a new life somewhere else, but I'm a coward. Every day is a fucking nightmare, I feel slowly getting  physically sick, depressed and more hopeless as the time goes by. I can't stand myself and my life, but I lack the power, energy and motivation to change it.",

I've been staying at home since then.\n\nYet, long before that (Perhaps for the past 2 or 3 years), I've been really declining, just barely passing my classes and even failing calculus twice.

I can never get anything done, I never feel interested in anything, I always feel tired.. And yet my mom has kind of been pushing me into getting a job while the move situation gets resolved. It really seems like the right thing to do.\nYet the idea just feels terrifying. Like I KNOW I should find one, bu I also dread the idea.

In my mind, I tell myself that I'm in no condition to work full-time but then I feel guilty because that might just be an excuse.  \nAnd just a few minutes ago, a cousin messaged me saying there was a spot I could take at a hotel that he works at.

My feelings are dulled, I talk in somewhat of a monotone (people tell me, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear it), and sometimes I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make any facial expressions so people think that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like them when I really do. Often I will be in a social environment and people will say my name to pull me out of a kind of thoughtless trance where I stare off into the distance with a blank mind, I never remember it starting, just being pulled out of it by someone else. I sometimes get asked if I am high when I am stone cold sober.\n\nI have also been having some weird thoughts, like to jump off of a balcony to my death, or violent ones like to stab someone with a knife I am holding or to crash my car on purpose.

My mind has become my prison. I have so much self hatred. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also self destructive. \n\nI moved halfway across the country after high school cause I thought it\u00e2\u0080\u0099d make me happy. Start new and leave all the negative behind. Move in with my dad and start working full time. I eventually move out to my own place. I was so unhappy about my job. I would also feel embarrassed to tell people where I worked. \n\nSo my new mission was to find a better job. Family member hooked me up with a really great job. For a 21 year old kid with no degree this job was great. I was prob making too much money for someone my age lol. A lot of dumb spending and lots of drunk nights. \n\nThe job really did help me out. I use to live in this duplex that had nasty carpet. I had no furniture and I had no plates or anything of that nature. Just my bedroom stuff, one entertainment center with a tv in my living room, and some rickety old stained blue recliner. \n\nEventually I put down wood floors and furnished my entire place from top to bottom in a matter of months. I even opened up a good credit card and started building my credit. Was the first time in my life I was able to save money and not live paycheck to paycheck. Lol I even had a health savings account that later paid to have my wisdom teeth removed. I really went far and I was proud of myself for once. \n\nIt just wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough though. I was still in so much pain. A job I loved turned into a job I loathed. I think I was genuinely happy for a couple months max. I ended up working there for two years and some change. \n\nI left when I decided I should go to school. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in a town with a great school and my family has gone to this school for generations. So I put in a month notice at my job and started taking steps to get myself ready for the college life. \n\nMy first semester was a breath of fresh air. I loved it. I loved going to class and doing something I actually wanted to do. That lasted for a whole semester and a minimester. My next full semester? I almost failed this semester. I was very close to getting out on academic suspension. I stopped going to class halfway through. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know if I want to do it anymore.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just running in circles. I think something will be good for me and I go and do it. It helps for s couple of months then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m back to square one. The amount of hate I have for myself in just ridiculous. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I hate anything even remotely close tot he way I hate myself. \n\nAt my school getting your ring is a big deal. Man I cannot fucking wait to get it either. But after I get it then what? Will it really make me happy?What happens when I finish my degree? Will I be happy then? Will I want more? What happens when I get a job I want? Will that be the turning point? Nothing is enough for me. It just keeps going. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a never ending pursuit of nothing. Fucking nothing. \n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m visiting my friends in another state right now. \nReconnected with an old friend. (Not the one I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m staying with). Things went well and things kind of flames out. Wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t good. This year comes around and things actually go through. She was very standoffish though after we were with each other the first night. I thought maybe I did something wrong. She continued to be short with me the next day. Then I went and got hammered for the football game and sent some dumb ass drunk texts and I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve really fucked it up now. She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even want to talk to me the next day after.\n\nWe are suppose to do something tonight for New Years. However, I feel that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go through. I just went a fucked it all up with some stupid drunk texts man. \n\nI just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a win and if I do get a win it helps me out for a month. \n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a hypocrite, a liar, selfish, and just about everything else.

        "Origin_reddit": "Hey all,\n\nNormally I try to muscle through these kinds of things on my own, but I'm having a rough go of things at the moment. Figured I'd make a post about it here and see what input some people have for me. I'm currently a 19 y/o \"sophomore\" in college, approaching what should (in theory) be my last semester at my local school before transferring to a 4-year school next fall. I'm now getting to the back end of my gen-eds, and one of the biggest reasons I went to a community college was to hopefully figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Coming out of high school and just picking a major seemed eternities away from anything I was capable of knowing, so I went the \"play it safe\" route.\n\nI just feel as if I'm approaching a time where a decision needs to be made and I'm seriously bummed out about it right now. I've been all across the map as far as majors/program considerations are concerned, wanting to be a police officer through most of high school---&gt;being an English teacher---&gt;doing something with computers and IT----&gt;wanting to do film? As if now, I'm pretty certain that being a police officer/teacher are no longer of interest to me, but I'm juggling the most between computers and film of all things.\n\nI've seen some older forum posts echoing similar sentiments, but really I'm just paralyzed with fear about making the wrong move. I'm generally pretty proficient with computers, but I have my doubts that I'd be able to keep up with the higher-level math requirements that come along with such a degree. I also wouldn't want to be a software dev or do coding really, and networking sounds boring to me. I just don't know of a sustainable career path that deals with troubleshooting hardware/software.\n\nAs far as film goes, I just really like video editing. Would pursue cinematography or something to that effect. With this one in particular I'm really concerned with being able to find work out of college, because so often we hear that these \"fine art\" esque degrees are a big no-no if you want job security and that's really important to me. Film school is also expensive so you have to be pretty grounded in your decision to attend. Despite the fact that I am not really cut out for a STEM related field (I've always performed better in liberal arts classes) I feel like I'd never find work.\n\nThis past semester I decided I'd not concern myself with gen-eds as much (only took Bio to get it out of the way) and have the rest be electives. In my case, I took two CIS classes (stands for Computer Information Systems), which were okay, but felt a lot like \"how to use microsoft office\" classes. Not necessarily super representative of the entire field. I even took a career class to get some more insight into potential paths. Helped a little bit but not as much as I envisioned it would.\n\nSorry for the essay. Bottom line is I just feel like the clock is ticking and I'm feeling seriously depressed and anxious. I can't stop thinking about it. Everyone seems to be finding a path that works for them, grinding out their coursework, while I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks. I feel like I'll never get to where I need to be :(\n\nThanks for reading this and taking the time to respond, if you decide to. Any and all feedback is seriously appreciated, I'm sure I could use it. Have a great evening everybody and happy NYE.",

        "Origin_reddit": "I've been on antidepressants for around 4 or 5 years, but I'm still a mess. I have no control over my emotions, my panic attacks and general anxiety lead me to ruin friendships and relationships, I have fits of rage that also lead me to say things I don't mean but obviously can't take back, which has made me a very lonely person because no one wants to be around someone like that. I don't blame them. I lost someone that I really really love because of all this shit. It's hard on my parents, it's been hard on the people around me and that's why they leave. I've ruined so many things that I can't fix.\n\nI hate my school. I love what I'm studying but the program at my school for it is a joke. All of the people in my program are annoying, I don't really like them. This past semester though, I started hanging out with them occasionally out of loneliness. That's not a good foundation for friendships.\n\nThis past year I've done a lot of growing, I've realized how shitty of a person I am, how selfish I am and how I've ruined every good relationship and friendship in my life. I still have no confidence, I'm still constantly paranoid, I'm always worried about my family members dying or something. I live 400 miles away from my childhood home. I have no friends where I live. My parents don't believe me when I say I have no friends. My mom says \"that's not true,\" and my dad just mocks me. Everything has gotten worse since starting antidepressants. If I hadn't started them, my anxiety and depression wouldn't have become a \"thing\" and everything would have been fine.\n\nSo this year, my goal is to get off antidepressants. So I'm going to do that. But where do I go from here? How do I take care of myself? How do I rebuild my life? How do I make friends? I need to start my life over, but how? I've ruined so much of my life. I'm not suicidal, I could never do that to my parents and my sisters and my family. But I feel so hopeless. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm 23 and I feel like my life is over. ",

        "Origin_reddit": "I am a 20 year old male who has 0 friends, never had a girlfriend, and live with my mom.  I dropped out of high school and have no interest in getting a ged. I have social anxiety, severe depression and anger.  I have been suicidal but I know it doesn't end my pain but just end my life.  I don't see myself doing that but I hate being miserable.  We get 1 life and I would like to enjoy it.  I've been alone, not leaving the house much since I was 14.  I have a lot of built up anger, boredom, and just want to enjoy myself.\n\nGetting a girlfriend is one of my biggest goals, but even then, I feel with all my built up anger and depression, I would be very rude and a terrible boyfriend.\n\nSome health problems I have are:\n I have hives called cholinergic urticaria(my skin becomes EXTREMELY painful when i get hot, or stressed, or whenever a person may sweat) It also affects my legs which are extremely itchy so i can't stand for too long.  There isn't really a cure for it.\n\nthings I have done the year of 2017 to help my hives and social anxiety:\nI eat healthy, take an antihistamine, and exercise which signficantly helped my hives but they are still there and are creeping back.\nFor social anxiety I went to a psychologist for months and helped slightly but stopped because it wasn't doing anything.  I take paxil and I went from never leaving the house to going on daily walks, family holidays, and the occasional walk in stores.  I still don't have a driver's liscense.\n\nI am also very depressed, I have social anxiety, and I have A LOT of built up anger.\n\nI have seen psychologists, therapist, etc and it just doesn't help.  Talking about my depression does nothing.  The last psychologist helped by answering some questions involving social interaction but didn't help my depression.  I have taken meds and I am currently taking paxil but I am against using anti-depressants.  I am not embarrased by it, but I feel it is unnatural and possibly dangerous in the long run.  \n\nThe reason I am here is asking what type of job/career can I pursue with my social anxiety, hives(won't be able to do any physcial work, standing for long periods of time, a lot of social interaction, etc) I feel the best possible way is to work from home or on the computer.  \n\nI have searched and searched and haven't found anything that would work.\n\nA dream job for me is make youtube videos but that is 1 in a million to make a living as well as I don't think I could be entertaining with my severe depression and anger, and social anxiety.\n\nI feel being able to save up money to move out on my own would significantly help my depression.  I hate living with my mom.  I am good at saving and am very cheap.  A studio apartment if fine with me but it seems wiser to buy a house instead.  \n\nAny help is greatly appreciated. ",
