In essence I felt that I held the key to happiness and was eager to share it with anyone who was willing to follow my example.\n\nUnfortunately, 4 years ago I went blind due to a congenital glaucoma, and was totally unprepared for that even though it was highly likely to happen during my lifetime.  At the beginning I was positive about the whole situation, so I went to a blind rehabilitation center thinking that after coming out I would pick up where I left and continue to be an example to others, but I totally underestimated the mental drag that comes with being blind.  I started seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist shortly after going blind, and in 4 years I had 3 psychologists and 2 psychiatrists tel me that I show no signs of clinical depression beyond wanting to die, so I'm not taking any meds.\n\nThe problem is that my life is no longer simple like before, as the strategies required to live blind make even the smallest problems a challenge to solve thus creating a huge mental drag that makes everything extremely unpleasant to do, and I know that these problems aren't going away as there is absolutely nothing I or anyone else can do to return my life to what it was.  I'm also no longer an example to anyone as I have become extremely dependent, not because I don't want to do things but rather because I refuse to accept that I'm blind and have to do them differently, so the only way I see out of this is killing myself, but even that becomes much harder to do blind.",

        "Origin_reddit": "Recently I received some bad news at home \u00e2\u0080\u0094 another health issue one would think would never impact me, even indirectly.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to get into those details, but it led me to decide I needed to stop medication because my \u00e2\u0080\u009cluck\u00e2\u0080\u009d is so bad no matter how good the medication I am still going to endure an incessant stream of negative events and circumstances that will overwhelm me.  My life is a story of waste: Brilliant, but not using that brain power at work; successful, but not enough to reach my goals.  Nothing ever comes easy and I see bad people left and right get their way.  It drives me nuts, and feeds into the \u00e2\u0080\u009cblack and white thinking\u00e2\u0080\u009d that plagues me.  So I met with my doctor to ask how to get off my medication altogether.  Previously, he expressed shock at the cocktail I was taking and said he would not continue the malpractice of my old doctor, who recently closed her practice.  He did not try to convince me to stay on the medication, or change to something else.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thankful he was honest about the methods to get off the pills.  But, it turns out the safe way to get off my medications will require over a year of weaning off them.  I wanted to stop going to doctors soon, but now I have to go through this process for over a year.  I handled the news well, surprisingly well. Still, it is incredibly difficult to live with my negative thinking, disturbing life events, a constant sense of failure and inadequacy, and potential withdrawals so serious I have to go through a year of tapering off meds.  I just needed to vent.  I feel like I have no one and nothing.

        "Origin_reddit": "I created this account to seek advice as I would prefer to protect the privacy of my wife and her brother - don't mind the vast emptiness of my post history. If this is the wrong place to post this or if someone knows a better sub, please let me know and I will remove / x-post as needed.\n\nI have tried to assist my brother-in-law over the course of three years in a multitude of ways but I am not sure if there will ever be anything that can truly be \"done\" for him - thus I am reaching out to see if anyone has a different take on it all. Obviously there will be big chuncks of information that will be omitted due to space / time / privacy / etc reasons but I'll try to express everything the best I can. My background is homeless youth (troubled home, graduated high school late, etc) and then military service for nearly a decade, 37 yrs old now.\n\nMy brother-in-law (Let's call him BIL or BILL for short) was under the care of a psychaiastrist from the age of 12 to 28 yrs old (when the doctor retired). This psychiastrist medicated Bill with Adderall and clonazepam under the diagnosis of depression and ADHD. When Bill talks to me about this doctor he readily admits that he thinks the relationship had crossed the line between doctor-patient and that the doctor probably prescribed whatever Bill wanted.\n\nFrom what I have been told from Bill's mom, dad and siblings, and Bill himself, Bill was a smart kid but wasn't someone who had any particular interest (no chess team, choir, sports, etc) and was pretty anti-social. Bill started drinking around age 16 as he felt him fit in.\n\nBill graduated from his very religious school and upbringing on time. He went into a custodial position right after HS and went to college for a portion of a year but dropped out. From that point forward, Bill lived with girlfriends and could hold a  job for about a fifth of a year up until I met the family. I emplyed Bill for about a year where I found that he was a hard worker but he required (I mean literally) constant supervision and instruction. Bill is not an idiot. I want to be clear about this. Bill is obviously an intelligent man who has a lot of potentional. With that said, he doesn't seem to have the ability to link the multiple steps from the beginning of a problem to the conclusion of the fix. Think about if I asked you to install a toilet - most of us, if we did not know what to do, would look up a video or read the instructions that were included. Bill would instead plan a large and very complicated process that would end up consuming an entire day without Bill being able to really explain what he did all day and why the toilet wasn't installed. However, if I explained the process up front or told Bill to look up a video, the task would get completed well and with quality. Bill has been pretty blunt in our conversations in that he says he has never paid a single dollar towards any rent in his life.\n\nBill expresses deep depression often, self-harms (and tells me that it's only for attention) and will actively sabotage any efforts to assist him. A good example is that he will discuss the desire to move into a support house so he can be around others going through this. He will make appointments, will ask me for a ride (where I will take time off work) and then on the day of the appointment, will reschedule the event (key point here that I didn't say \"cancel the event\") and proceed to get smashed drunk. I only find out after I have driven an hour and a half to pick him up that he is passed out drunk on his mom's sofa.\n\nSo that is Bill in a nutshell.\n\nBill's mother was, by my defination, an enabler to the extreme. She acted completely dumbfounded each and everytime Bill is drunk / quits a job / gets arrested / etc. She will take even the most obvious lies he spins as facts. I had been around for when Bill would tell her, slurring words and stumbling, that he isn't drunk and she would believe him, chalking it up to \"Bill must be tired\". This continued all the way up until earlier this year when she realized that if she kept cleaning up after him, he would kill himself (driving drunk, alcohol poisioning, self harm that went wrong). We have paid for Bill to go through five rehabs over the last 3 years and used state rehabs twice as we no longer have the funds for private help. Bill's girlfriend finally got tired of everything and booted him out. He moved in with his mother until recently when the local PD had arrested Bill six times in two weeks for PIs and trespassing. At that point we took him to a state rehab in Fort Worth, Tx to try yet again.\n\nBill finished the rehab about a month ago, got drunk and is now living homeless in the FTW area. He keeps in touch regulary (I cover his phone expenses, provided him with cold weather gear, shelter info, and visit him weekly). He has been hospitalized twice for alcohol poisoning over teh last month but still refuses to follow-up on the resources that are offered to him. I was tehre for both ER stays (both turned into 3-4 day in-patient stays) where the nurses and doctors offered him help but he never showed up to any of the follow-up visits. Bill's entire family ahs told him many, many times that we are all here for him.\n\nI care about Bill but the most painful part of all this (for me) is I see how much of a toll this takes on my wife. She is a recovering addict (4 years sober!) and she has an intimate understanding of the pain and physical harm that can evolve from Bill's situation. I have spent many nights going to NAR-Anon groups trying to learn to be as supportative as I can for my wife but with Bill, I honestly have no idea what else I have to offer. My wife has remained sober as she makes that choice every single morning to be sober.\n\nI guess after writing all this I have a fairly simple question for a very complicated situation - Can someone tell me stories about what has helped others / themselves in the past that might have seen any of this?\n\nI know there are some folks out there that can't be helped. Others still can be helped but only they can start the process. If we can't help Bill, what can I say to the family to help (as much as is possible in this situation)?\n\nThanks for anyone's time who reads this and thanks even more for anyone who has even the slightest advice for us to help Bill.\n\nCheck back for edits as my grammar / spelling / ability to express coherent thoughts is on par with a damn toddler.",

He is angry, mentally abusive, short tempered, and has started abusing alcohol like I have never seen him do before in the almost 30 years I've been around. His is still my dad' and I still love him' but it has been a tough couple months. I have drawn the longer of the sticks, because unlike my mother and my sister I don't live at home so I only see him a few times a week, when they have to deal with his abuse everyday. \n\nI do what I can to be a support for them, I've always been a person who could be strong for another person (especially my mom). She leans on me with all her problems (financial and mental) mostly dealing with her depression that stem back to losing her own mom. It doesn't bother me when she calls me sad because usually she just needs to vent and everything is ok. \n\nBut now its different\n\nOne, it's not just my mom calling it's my sister also, who I have never had to worry about because she is a mentally strong person, but now I feel my dad is breaking her down and she isn't strong enough to deal with my dad and be the shoulder for my mom who is starting to spiral. Two, my mom will not seek help (even though she has in the past), and my sister mentioned she has been making suicidal comments (which I'm not sure if she did that when she first dealt with depression, I was pretty young and don't remember). \n\nWe are a fairly poor family who has managed to get by, but it's not like we can afford a psychologist. Which is part of the reason I have taken the role of being the person everyone in the family vents to. \n\nSo I guess what I'm asking the reddit community if anyone takes the time to read all this is....\n\n1. Has anyone dealt with a stroke victim like this before and how did they handle it.\n2. How do I keep my younger sister sane when she means so much to me, and I hate to see her fall into depression like my mom has in the past\n3. How do I get my mom to seek whatever help is out there, and are there any freeish psychs out there that help people who are in a deep state of depression.\n4. How do I try to stay strong when my entire family is falling apart and I feel so helpless and scared.\n\nSorry for the probably million misspellings, it's been a long day and I'm tired. \n\nThanks to anybody who has been through something similiar and can possibly help. Part of this might just be I needed to vent, and had no one to turn to.

I don't do it socially I do it at home at my computer mostly because im a big computer tech geek person. I get high and enjoy my time alone just doing nothing but shit..the thc makes nothing great. \nweed is my biggest life killer...I skipped high school so much in my life and had crazy allergies and always felt sick so I kind of fucked up my education only to realise in my mid 20s that Im allergic to weed and it makes me have a runny nose the next day and itchy eyes and I have asthma so I breath badly when i smoke a lot in the next couple days and get bloated and just feel so shitty.. so that fucked with my education..im 28 now. I think it fucked my social life too and Iv know this for a couple years and I don't wanna smoke but i just cant stop I hate myself its a real addiction. It makes me not wanna hang with people or go in public due to paranoid thoughts. It fucks up my motivation and ambition and i just work in a call center ( which im a top seller at ) but its such a low income and low ambition job.\n\nI don't have many friends and I honestly hate a lot of people , in my experience I don't meet or attract cool people at all. \n\nI have a gf and shes so cool and so like me..shes a little bit of a problem drinker and weve been together for 3 years and have had our ups and downs. \n\nIm a 5'11 wide guy with muscles..I should weigh 200 but i weigh 250 and its a drag and im self conscious about my tummy even if it isnt huge but its still a fat tummy. I have issues with my knees and back ( ashritis since im 15 and medication doesnt really help much anymore ).\n\nI used to play hockey a lot and with the boys we would go out and shit it was a good way of having friends who are men in my life but since the past 3 years iv torn my groin ( sports hernia ) twice which will have you not doing sports for about a year every time you tear it. Hockey was my life and its fucking gone and I feel like it will tear again.\n\nOn top of that i sweat a lot...even when i was 210 lbs I was sweating a lot..mostly my back and my head so my hair gets drenched walking a couple blocks and then my back sweats and it drips down into my boxers and i just gotta wear black cloths or if i sit on my ass theyll be a sweat stain.. its a huge thing in my life and it affects me very much in a lot of situations, lets just say im the only guy at work with a fan and I overheat very easily a lot..even in -20 weather if i walk like 3 blocks ill get home sweaty and im just always like wtf...imagine in +20 weather how bad it can be..I wear the same shirt and cloths almost everyday that dry up quick and are dark colors...\n\nMy gf is great she doesnt mind the sweat she is a special girl, im surprised i even have a gf like wtf. altho she has issues similiar to me i can understand how we are in eachothers life still...having a girl in ur life can be great and can also be the shittiest thing ever but once you go there you never can go back to being single.\n\nI don't know im just looking for words of wisdom and advice maybe,..I know i don't have it as bad as some people here.. I have a good family but i avoid them...i don't rly like my dad but hes in my life and my parents divorced when i was 1 year old I think...he cheated on her and tried to fuck with her during my childhood and all kinds of fucked up shit...\n\nIm def stuck in my comfort bubble. All I wanna do is either become an actor ( fuck theyll stop the scene and be like can you not sweat sir during the scene ) or become a rapper/sound designer but that shit involves connecting with people who just never seem interested and everyone wants to do their own thing nowadays and I feel i need a mentor for this so its hard.\n\nI could go on and I feel i can't even explain the real issues in my life in this post.\n\nAny advice/words of wisdom?\n",

I told her that I feel like maybe I'm doing that too.... Eating to fill a void.... I told her how I miss my family (I moved out of my dads house and he's on the other side of the country so I can't just go down the street) and how I just am generally sad, dropping out of college, etc. How eating makes me forget how I feel and I feel at peace. How I'm too scared to actually do anything so I feel like I might just be letting nature take its course. \n\nHer face scared me. I never have told anyone about how I felt, except for y'all. (I post sometimes.) Her face just looked like I had told her I murdered puppies or something. Part of me hated that I told her, that I was weak. But another part, and the reason I post this, feels free. I feel good that someone knows. I don't feel alone. \n\nShe's gonna help me lose weight and focus on music to try to find something meaningful in life. I feel good. I accept that I do suffer from depression. I was diagnosed before but as I said I didn't take it seriously. \n\nIf you are reading this, I hope you find help and someone to trust. You aren't alone. There are more of us than you know. ",

They diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder, but I don't know how accurate the diagnosis could be given that I have the tendency to act accordingly to avoid certain diagnosis. My mother keeps trying to label me as a psychopath or sociopath, or a borderline. Mainly because I don't love her, I don't necessarily care about her or my brother. I think about them dying a lot, but I wouldn't kill them or anyone. I just know that I wouldn't particularly be upset if it happened, and that goes for most other members of my family.\nI do have feelings for a few of my friends and partners, boyfriends or friends with benefits but I can't picture losing them like I can my parents. Maybe I'm too self absorbed but I really don't know.\nMy IQ is 108 so I don't think I could be a sociopath given that they usually are much smarter than the average person. A psychopath I don't know either but I really don't want to diagnose myself with anything, I'd hate to label myself as that kind of person.\nI used to be a Christian. I was reading an old journal a few days ago, from eighth and ninth grade. I had written out a prayer, angrily question God as to why he allowed me to be born without the capacity to love my family.\nI've never been suicidal, or tried to hurt myself past a certain extent. It seems like every emotion I do have is stronger to me than it would be the average person, I don't know why. It's hard for me to empathize with most people.\nBased on experience or general knowledge from a third party, what are the possibilities that my mother is right about me?

For about 12 months now I've had massively interrupted sleeping schedules, and my body is used to only getting 4-5 hours sleep, sometimes able to function on 2-3.\nIn the last 4 weeks, my thoughts tend to become darker, I feel the sensation of suffocation and drowning (I'm crying as I type this..)\n\nI hate the thought of professional help (counsellors/therapists) but I may consider it soon. I have a loving yet dysfunctional family, 2 brothers and loving parents. I live in a good home and have a part time job as a cashier in a supermarket that I've stuck to for 2 years. I'm waiting on university offers and if I'm lucky I'll be moving states to Melbourne City in Victoria for something along the lines of Law/Business.\nI can't shake these awful feelings, my brain feels continuously sick.

        "Origin_reddit": "Not sure why I'm posting here, maybe just to see if anyone else is going through something similar. Skip to bottom for the TL/DR. \n\n\n(M/24/Appalachia)\nBeen depressed for over a decade now, and every year it's gotten worse. I feel like I am the subject of some cruel joke, a demented Truman Show, just tortured constantly in every aspect of life. Even the simplest tasks that people do, I have problems with. \n\n\n\nI am quite ill and have severe chronic pain (FAPs), but I can't get help because I live in the south and only junkies are allowed pain medicine here now with the new laws, and plus \"I'm too young to be so sick!\". I'm also a student but every year I fail half of my classes due to my illness or my severe crippling anxiety. The exhaustion is constant, and I don't have the mental or physical energy to do anything. I can't work either due to the same issues so I have no income, don't even have a bank account because I can't afford it. What money I do get I spend on cannabis for pain relief and so that I can keep food down (FGID). The pain really is crippling and I'm in tears from it 3+ times a day. I've waited 9 hrs in the ER, and I was still not seen by a doc. That's \"coal country\" for you, raped by corporations and then left to rot (//soapboxing)\n\n\n\nI sleep about 3 or 4 nights out of the week (~4 hrs nightly), and have gone 6 days without sleep. Right now I'm on day 2. The sleep is never restful, I wake up about once an hour, the extreme pain creates these violent dreams where I am constantly getting brutally murdered. Takes me at least 3 hours to fall asleep, and I've spent 12+ hours laying awake in bed trying to sleep (I think that's why my joints hurt so bad.)\n\n\n\nMy psych is useless, he literally won't let me finish a single sentence and constantly berates me. He also refuses to treat me unless I take Paxil (his biggest sponsor) which previously led me to a suicide attempt and almost got me expelled from school (they thought I was on hard drugs). My psych didn't even have record of this suicide attempt even though I told them about it immediately. I've tried all the SSRI's and SNRI's and they all leave me worse than when I came in. I want to keep living and I'm afraid these meds will ensure that I don't. Sadly I can't switch doc's because the state pharmacy board will say I'm Dr. Shopping, being in WV they take it seriously. All of this together makes life like Chinese water torture. Drop by drop, day by day.\n\n\n\nThat's not even the worst of it, but I'll keep that one to myself for now or else some of you may think suicide *IS* a valid option for me! This event really gives me symptoms of PTSD though, but I don't self diagnose, and it puts a heavy load of regret on me I carry every day. Another deep regret I carry is from this: My good friend left from my house to a planned fight, which ended in my good friend using self defense and shot one of the men who was attacking. My friend just got 10 years for it, and I have so much weight on my heart that if I could have just stopped my friend from leaving he would still be free and this victim would still be alive. I think about it everyday. It really is torture in this poor tiny mountain town. This is as close to a 3rd world country in the US as it gets.\n\n \n\nSocially I'm just as bad, heavily introverted. College is hell, I go to a small local campus of a bigger uni, meaning the class size is small. Forced participation is a nightmare, and there are no worse words to me than: \"Ok everyone, find a partner\" I end up alone every time. My every cough, every lead pencil broken, every sniff of the nose sends a wave a pure cringe through my body, even though I know it doesn't matter and no one cares. My anxiety gets so bad I have to leave class to puke, yet my psych sees no issues there. I find my self tailing friends at bars and if they leave I'm quietly in the corner awaiting their return. Comedy is my only crutch because physically I'm monstrous and have no self-esteem or confidence, I literally look like I have 2 black eyes ALL THE TIME. Tried all the creams and stuff but it's beyond help I think.\n\n\n\nI don't expect anyone to have some magic solution but at this point I'm willing to try just about anything. I don't remember what it's like to be happy, and I'm forgetting what it's like to be human as well. Thanks for listening it really means the world to me.\n\n\n\nPositives: I have an apartment w/ no rent, I'm good enough comedian to have a YT channel. Play guitar fairly well. Compassionate and empathetic to the point where it screws me over. Great w/ kids (studying Elementry Ed., no anxiety towards the kids, but if an adult is there too the anxiey is through the roof) I also don't really get social anxiety when streaming on Twitch (unless I've had a little too much ganja) perhaps the the screen being a barrier that blocks some of the anxiety, who knows.\n\n\nSorry for the novel, that's adderall for ya.\n\n\n\n#TL/DR\n24/m lifelong depressed (ex-selfharmer), uprooted to poor Appalachian town at age 20.

        "Origin_reddit": "Hey. Excuse my incoming rant, I just feel like I have to get a few things off my chest or they will crush me for good and I have never done this before. Also excuse my English - I am prone to not paying attention to the grammar when I get long-winded.\n\nWhat a year this was. Well, not for me but for pretty much everyone else I know. Success just can't stop coming for them. Pretty much everyone is doing great, even the people about which I used to think that they would end up in my current situation. And then there is me, in all of my useless, depressed self, wallowing in my self-inflicted misery. The only things that were enjoyable to me happened on a macro scale so they didn't really affect my personal actual situation at all.\n\nI'm 24, still living with my parents and lonelier than ever before. I spend most of my days at home, mostly reading and watching useless crap on the internet. I read books too, but not as many as I used to. I've got attention issues. 10 years ago I could tear through a 600 pages long book in a day, today I can barely go for 15 minutes before I feel like I have to do something else (like refreshing a webpage and seeing that nothing has happened) and then have a hard time coming back to whatever I was doing. I can still read fast but I feel like I've become addicted to the ever-avaiable constant stream of shallow information that is so typical for this day and age - I think I know more the American electoral system now than I have ever wanted to know even though I live half a world away. Still, I've read pretty much through the entire Western canon over the last few years, trying to find answers... to anything with nothing coming out of it.\n\nI procrastinate... a lot. It causes issues at the uni where I have been behind on pretty much every deadline I've ever gotten and considering what I've been told about my latest paper I may not even be able to finish it. But the degree I am trying to get is useless anyway (I chose it a few years ago in a bout of depression after I quit my original pursuit of some economics degree), so it probably doesn't matter anyway. The worst thing is that I think that I actually have a good work ethic when I really set my mind to something, but I hardly ever actually get to that point and I have a hard time staying in it because my mind just goes somewhere else. I've tried to write a book - I think I am pretty good with words, at least in my native language, and I thought it would offer me some more opportunities for escapism (that's pretty much the only peace I get these days). I got really excited, spend 3 weeks on it... and yet once I stopped some 30k words in, I have been having a hard time getting back, even though I have the whole thing in my head.\n\nThose two issues are probably aided by thyroid problems. A doc told me two or three years ago that I should see a specialist because my thyroid apparently isn't working exactly as it should. I've ignored that advice and now I fear going to see a doctor because they will shit on me for neglecting the issue. I think it's just an irrational fear of criticism and denial. I know that I should do it and yet I can't bring myself to it. I've been delaying and delaying, always putting it in the \"after that\" spot. I am an idiot. Telling myself that I am an idiot does not really help though.\n\nI've got communication issues too. Had them for a long time. I was bullied a bit at school when I was like 12 but while I thought for a longest time that it didn't affect me (I've become friends with all those people overtime), it probably ended up affecting me more than I thought it would. It certainly put a dent into my school performance, even though that was probably paired with the fact that I did not have learn anything for my first 6-7 years at school because all that stuff was too easy for me and so I never really learned how to learn, if you know what I mean.\n\nThe worst thing is that I feel like there is no reason for me to not live a normal life. I am clever... heck, my intelligence is well above average according to everything I have ever been told. I look normal - I think I have a pretty face, pretty green eyes and nice hair and all that. My height ended up average, close to 6 feet, even though my paediatrician has always said I'd turn out 5'5-6 at best. I am bit underweight and have problems putting on weight (thyroid again?), but that's probably the only issue with my appearance. I was surprised to discover that my voice is kinda whiny a few years ago, but I don't think it's that bad.\n\nAnd yet I feel like I repulse people. I've never had a girlfriend. Those few girls I liked never... really paid attention to me, even though I was nice to them and they were nice to me... I should've probably been more assertive but I've always feared the embarassment of bad social experience. I've pretty much stopped trying over the years. Also, I don't remember any girl ever trying to get me and if any did, I remain completely blind to it to this day. As I said, I've eventually become friends with most people around me but those relationships were always pretty shallow. I've had maybe two really good friends over the last 10 years (mind you, hardly the \"best friend\" category) but even they have been gradually drifting out of my life. I can't really fault them for that as they have their own exciting lives and I have almost nothing to offer in exchange for friendship... they've certainly tried to get me out of my shell (and still do from time to time) and I will remain grateful for that.\n\nLast summer I got a work in a warehouse. Just wanted to make some quick buck and I think manual job suits me because my mind can shut off and go to its own place without any consequences. I did the job well, all eager and active and got on a good raport with some co-workers. And yet after a few weeks they started telling me that there were no hours avaiable for me even though they told me there would be hours for several months when they hired me. Hell, they even hired more people after me and those were still coming to work. I've checked in a few more times after that and all I got were weird faces and evasive answers so I stopped. To this day I don't know what I did wrong. It's a small episode but it's pretty indicative of the rest of my life... I don't know what I did wrong and yet people never really connected with me on a deeper level so I drifted away from them as they did from me.\n\nI should add that my parents fight a lot... have been fighting for 15 years. It's a real wonder that nobody ever got hurt. My mom's got anxiety and a phobia from dirt and diseases so she gets panic attacks basically all the time. It took my dad years to become mindful of that and the relationship has gone really sour over that time. Today they just fight over everything, even the smallest, stupidiest things, like who is going to cook a dinner. That has probably affected me too when it comes to interpersonal relationships... \"is this what I am going to get if I get a girlfriend? That's not worth it.\"\n\nI think I am getting to the end of this. I feel like I am missing some things I wanted to say, but I am glad that I've got at least this out of me. Happy New Year and let's hope the things get better.",

I'm tired of living.\n\nOther thoughts happen when I am generally rather happy or even excited. The thoughts are more like: yes this is nice, but life honestly feels so monotonous or pointless.

I was OK, but since pretty much like march 2016 i begin with constant attacks of anxiety in the work and in public places, I was constantly alert about my surrounds, six month ago, back to June I have my first anxiety and panic attack on a public event with rich people in where my boyfriend was attend to, he almost broke with me then, I go to 2 therapist but they cant do anything with my case, they don't even know how to diagnose me. \nAgain my boyfriend try to broke with me mid September, I almost kill myself, come to a mental institution but neglected being interned, but they gave me medication (Prozac and klonopin). I was with two psychiatrist since then, but they still don't know my diagnosis. I finally have a appointment with a specialist on January 3 to validate and see my case to make a formal diagnosis.\n\nBut something happens today on the morning (December 31); my boyfriend want to break with me, now this time seriously, I cried, I scream, I have the worst panic and anxiety attack I ever had, he said that he loves me deeply, but when I was with other people (like friends of him) I change totally, my voice, my manners, my way of speak, walking, acting, thinking, even what I speak of changes totally, the worst of this? I don't have consciousness this happens, I remember been there and all but, didn't notice these changes.

I recognized early on that unlike my friends, I had to actively work for any semblance of happiness and peace.  Once I started college, my old friend sexual performance anxiety came back full force and hasn't left.  Being at one of the nations biggest party schools and mecca for beautiful girls my age, feeling left out of the one thing that all human cultures around the world share feels bad man.  This has created a gaping hole inside me that I fill with booze and pot.

I feel like a morbidly obese person who has to lose 300 lbs but hasn't started yet.  Everyone who loves me encourages me to fix my life, but looking at life, society, and the human condition from rock bottom changes you.  After you tell yourself you'd rather be dead a certain amount of times, your outlook on life and the universe as a whole really does drastically change.  When I look into my future, I see years of battling this dark and disparaging side of me.

        "Origin_reddit": "Edited: changed some of the wording, and fixed a typo. I wrote this in a hurry.\n\nHello. The situation is as follows:\n\nI suffer from extreme depression. I have been diagnosed with some OCD symptoms, but other than that, I exhibit no \"abnormal\" traits, and consequently most of my friends do not know that often, I am in a lot of pain.\n\nI went to this school to get away from home, and this decision was supported by my doctors. First year, I ran through some obstacles, but overall, my grades were alright. I made new friends, the dean of engineering supported me (he ended up knowing of my depression), and although both semesters were hard, I would say that I did a good job.\n\nSophomore year, I also dealt with pain, but I had developed more ways to get rid of it. I had joined the dodgeball club, several intramural teams, and worked on a math conjecture which I later proved, which I was told needed graduate level work. \n\nI went through a variety of small situations in college, which I will not go into detail. It is universally agreed and seen that I have not made an attempt to hurt anyone or myself, nor have I made a threat to anyone or my own life. No fights, no animosity between me and teachers, nothing. I have spoken of being in a lot of pain, and one response to me disclosing this to professionals, which I now know is controversial, was to encourage me to go to a ward. I kept repeating that I thought it was a bad idea, but I finally gave in, and the result was terrible. I missed my classes, I was in a place where I was not allowed any homework or devices, and I felt separated from my friends. And I came to realize that the school may be playing a game to get me to leave. \n\n Although I made many friends that see a happier, kind of smart guy who seems great to hang out with, I sought help with very close friends who were really extraordinary people who support me as I type this. I talked about my depression with these people, and they supported me, and we shared a common goal of me recovering to a much happier, less anxious person. \n\nOne of these friends confided in someone from the staff that she was worried about me. She meant no harm by it, and was possibly optimistic that the person might help. The response, which she forwards back to me was to cut off all communication with me. This is from someone (the faculty member) who knows one thing about me- that I am depressed.\n\nTime goes on, and I make it through freshman year. It was tough, but I know that staying close or at home would slowly break me. \n\nFast forwarding through sophomore year, to the end of the first semester. I got sick, which prevents from exercising. I depend on exercise to relieve stress and I am in fantastic shape as a result. Strike 1. Then, because I was sick, I was in too much pain to sleep. So I didn't sleep for a whole night. Strike 2. Then I got drunk. Strike 3.\n\nAs I was drunk, I expressed suicidal thoughts. I was crying out for help, saying that I was in a lot of pain. Fast forward after that, since the next information will make the stuff in between not very helpful, and we have the student conduct board determining it was okay for me to go back. They were super kind, and the last call I had with them was very comforting with them. I met with my psychiatrist and told him everything, and he agreed I was ready to go back to school. Things weren't great, but they were easier. I was abused by security guards in the hospital they took me to(whole nuther story) and I was still trying to recover. Friends who were worried about me expressed their hope for my well-being. A teachers were happy when I told them I was allowed to go back, with all of them being very supportive.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that, because of fear of something unfair happening, I keep my depression almost entirely to myself. \n\nFast forward to now, I receive a call from the dean of student health and well-being that he wants me to leave. As simple as that. I tell him everything- that my parents think this is a bad idea, that professional opinion thinks its a fucking horrible idea, and that I have been studying hard to make up for the stuff I missed. He doesnt give a shit and insists on the meeting which has the chance to break me. \n\nPart of me sees this as a formality. He never explicitly stated that I will have to leave, and merely encouraged it at first. He says he will contact a third party evaluator to check on me, and this kind of comforts me cause if this person isn't from the school, I can easily convince him/her that a) I am not going to be in that situation again because I will never drink again b)that leaving the school with my closest friends and losing my courses there will leave me in a terrible state.\n\nI ended up doing research and I learn that these meetings end up being one-sided. I did more research, and I see, given the situation, it violates the Americans with Disabilities Act on so many  levels.\n\nAgain, I do not know what they could or will do, and I politely expressed my concern with the dean who called me that I am worried that this meeting is a scam trying to flush me out. Of course I did not use those words. What worries me is that this person will eagerly ignore medical professionals or my reasoning that this was a bad idea to go on with the meeting. He has an extremely small, if any, amount of evidence that shows me as someone who should leave. But I am worried of how corrupt this meeting is.\n\nCan someone please help me? I've been feeling sick after hearing about this. I have gotten a lot of support from friends, which, in written form, plays a role in the meeting. At least 10 people in 2 days have desired to write letters of support. I want to know if the absurdity of this leaves me another option other than crying. I know this is unfair, but the difference about this and, say, a bad referee call, is that this decision threatens my well-being and crushes the little chance I have to recover.",

I have spent 22/24 hours of each day for the past 12 months at home, in a 10x12 room staring at a fucking computer screen, because I have lost the energy to do anything else. This past year has been absolutely the hardest (outside of when I was hospitalized against my will about 15 years ago, which ended up doing zero good for me, surprise surprise.). I have been to about 12 or so medical professionals, had 3 CTs, 2 xrays, been on 20 different medications, and they can't figure out why I'm sick. They say I don't have cancer, which while horrible would have at least been an answer. It is entirely fucked up, I fully recognize that, but there are days that if a doctor told me I have only a month or so left to live, I'd cry in relief. I've seen specialists who treat me as just another number who got unlucky in life. Unlucky in life, boy, that sure does sum it up though. Abusive family, criminal father, automatic black sheep from birth, poor, redheaded, fat from young age, bullied, sick a LOT, etc etc. Blah fucking blah. At least I'm not hungry, though, right? That's supposed to make you feel better, comparing your misfortune to others'. The problem with that is your experiences are exactly that. You can't help but view your continuing chain of fucking shit problems as well, exactly that, to be rather repetitive. I don't know, I guess I'm ranting. I feel like I'm taking up space. I even thought about what my room would be used as once I'm not around anymore, whatever that ends up meaning. Maybe Mom could convert it into an office. That'd be nice. I do live at home, but at least that's for a good reason I suppose. Those 2 hours I mentioned? That's transporting my elderly grandfather back and forth from his day care program. He has Alzheimer's and Dementia and I keep an eye on him. God knows why they trust me with him. I'm the fucking psychotic asshole, right? I could keel over any minute (hopefully) and then what? I guess he'd go to a nursing home. So I suppose I'm a better choice than those nightmarescapes of fucking places. I don't know. I just want to fade away without harming anyone else, or myself for that matter. I don't -want- to die, but I don't see much of any other option. Not that I'd do it myself, I'm too much of a fucking coward to do it. I guess I'm stuck. Just skip this post, it's a waste of time.\n\nI am not intending nor do I plan to harm myself or others. ",

I know (because others have told me, however won't say what was said) that people talk about me behind my back. I don't know what they say ever, and I also don't know who does. This is brutal as far as my anxiety goes, and I have a tendency to catastrophize over small things, and it spirals until I'm a dysfunctional mess. More recently, I've been paranoid that none of my friends actually care about me, since they seem to be avoiding me irl more recently. I have friends that are depressed and understand how I feel when it comes to my depression, but they give off the same vibe and I'm at a loss. Beyond that, I'm currently in a really fucked up domestic situation. I haven't seen my dad in coming up on a year now, mainly because he was somewhat emotionally abusive for a while, and I couldn't take it anymore, and my mom and stepdad are always almost 5 hours from me with the exception of holidays. I'm 17, finishing high school while living with my grandparents. I stayed here for 2 reasons: Transferring schools for senior year would suck, and I value my relationships here a lot, but like I said before my relationships seem to be falling apart. Being with my grandparents stresses me out, and it's hard on them too, so I just feel like a burden to them. I talk to 2 different therapists, and I am on 3 different medications for my depression and none of them help. The only time I ever have felt happy recently was the one time I got high smoking weed with a couple friends a few weeks ago. I was in a relationship from May of two years ago until November of this year, and she broke up with me for what I feel like was a bogus reason. I was in a skype call with some people and after a while of not talking I just left because I couldn't handle it anymore and felt like I was just there to feel like people cared about me for once. I didn't feel like they actually did anymore and I've spent the rest of the night feeling like shit. I feel like such a nuisance, and that my existence is a bother to everyone, including myself. I wish there was a way to disappear, and not have anyone remember I ever was there. \n\nTLDR; Today has been the worst New Year's Day I've had in a while and I just wish I could stop existing because my life is so unbelievably hard for someone with my mental issues",
