I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m only 17, I should be out having fun, meeting people, experiencing my youth, but my depression and anxiety are so bad I could hardly muster up the courage to even set foot outside.

If someone has done research(science included) and want to share his/her opinion, they are scientifically correct because if you have science to defend your theory/opinion/idea/thesis/conclusions you are correct.\n\nTo start off,summarizing and paraphrasing is the most important thing when researching/investigating because that way you'll learn anything with 100% perfect clarity. In order to paraphrase and summarize you simply have to put what you have read and seen in your words. Summarizing and paraphrasing is scientifically proven the best way to learn anything.\n\nEmotional Intelligence(EQ) or (EI) is the ability to take control of your emotions and also being able of controlling others emotionally such as intimidating someone, scaring someone,dominating someone, and so on. Emotional Intelligence is the skill of taking control of your emotions and by taking control of your emotions you will not let fear,panic,depression,anxiety,anger,shyness,nervousness control your mind. Always maintain your mind under control. EQ is much more important than IQ(intelligence).\n\nThere are many articles on the internet claiming they can cure social anxiety, and other mental disorders, but in reality is much more complex than simply saying things like; Be more open to people, be confident, talk to girls. All of these tips/advises are nothing but helpless information for people with different mental disorders(same as mental illness).\n\nEmotional Balance means to control and keep your emotions balanced, don't let sadness, and other feelings/emotions take control of your mind and body completely.\n\n",

        "Origin_reddit": "TLDR One can often feel fine mentally, but be unable to present this to the world, because the body manifests depression so thoroughly on a physical level. The face and body present depression, to the point where its literaly impossible to smile or convey any genuine impression of yourself, even though you should otherwise be mentally fine.  \n\n\n...\n\n\nExample, I wake up in the morning, my mood is more or less fine and i feel ready to go to work and go about my day. I get out of bed and i feel a little stiff and achy, maybe dehydrated. \n\nGo to the bathroom and in the mirror Im like \"Oh no, what the fuck is that!?\" I look unbelievably sad and unhealthy, my eyes are hollow and look sad and weak, I dont recognise myself in this face at all. I summon up the emotions that made me quite confident yesterday, but they barely register on the face. Its impossible to smile, it looks like a grimace. \n\nI soend half an hour in front of the mirror trying to force myself to look normal and composed, but every time i turn back and catch myself again i see this shell emanating horrible vibes. \n\nAgain, i didnt wake up feeling this way, I wasnt even aware of it until i became aware of myself physically by 1) moving around and 2) observing myself. \n\nYou end up almost late for work because you cant convince yourself to leave the house. It might even be easier if you were mentally down, at least that would fit with your physical self image now. \n\nPeople at work say, \"Ive not seen you so depressed, whats got you down\", or \"I think i know what youre sad about\". But for all that, it is nothing in particular you're down *about* - it is a physical thing. \n\nYou just want your face to cheer up and your shoulders to relax so you can be yourself, but its physically impossible. There are no tricks or thoughts that will lift you out of it. The subtlest or most powerful *thought* doesnt matter because your body is not physically expressing what is happening inside. \n\nWe always talk about depression as a *mental* illness but in my experience its the physical factors that predominate, and to such an extent that the ability to deal with it mentally *almost doesnt matter*. You can have your thoughts in order but what your body is presenting to the world physically is an impossible barrier to overcome. \n\n(This isnt well written, im never as smart on paper as i think i am in my head, but id love to hear if anyone relates to this or has any thoughts).

I have 1700 hours in CS:GO and I'm worse than people with half my hours, I played (association) football my whole life and I was always trash at that, I tried to do guitar for a few years when I was younger but I got kicked out because the teacher thought I wasn't practising-I was, I just was really bad at it. I have a few friends but they don't like me that much and I don't blame them because I'm a bad person to be friends with, I am boring, I have no distinct interests and I can't hold a conversation for more than 5 seconds. I just don't understand why I should like myself, if anything it'd be irrational not to hate myself because every single aspect of my life is going terribly and it's ultimately no-one's fault but my own.",
