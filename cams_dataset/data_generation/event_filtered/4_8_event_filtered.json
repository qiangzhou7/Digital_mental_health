Sure I can do shit to distract myself from it, but when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m alone with my thoughts and nothing else, I just feel so lonely and empty. Distractions temporarily fill up that stupid hole. I can watch TV all day and not think about it too much. I can go out and get drunk. I can listen to music. But the minute the distractions are gone I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just stuck with myself, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just there. Just existing. None of it actually matters; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually have any passion or will to live. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just scraping by and trying to forget about how shitty I feel.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found makes me feel completely fine, if only temporarily; infatuation. I fall head over heels for girls, and I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely linked to how shitty I feel. The thing is though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a virgin. All these crushes go unrequited, and they only get worse. In high school they were pretty tame, but since leaving I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had 2 massive ones that basically took over my life for their duration, one that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still going on right now. The first one the girl wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever really interested in me. She was friendly enough, and we clicked a little, but it was always this forced awkwardness to it. I barely knew her, not really. We never had anything but surface level conversations. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go anywhere at all, but I built the whole thing up so much in my head that it took me months and months to get over her.\n\nThen I became friends with this other girl. Real, genuine friends, which is rare for me. I found someone I have a genuine connection with. It made me feel amazing that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m capable of that deep connection. And instead of being able to just enjoy that, my stupid fucking brain makes me fall for her. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s literally my best friend man, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hopelessly into her. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only one I ever open up to, even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a little. But she has a boyfriend, and while sure we get along great and support each other and shit, I know somewhere deep down she just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see me that way. But it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter. Cause that hole\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there. And while she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in my life, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s filled. And as pathetic as it sounds, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of worth the pain of seeing the girl you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so into being with someone else, because at least I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not alone. I have someone to message all day. Someone who cares whether I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m actually alive. Someone who depends on me. It means the world.\n\nBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not healthy. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a temporary solution to a permanent problem.  The problem is that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just fucking broken somehow. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just empty inside. And even though being around her makes me feel like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m someone worth a damn, someone that I could grow to like, really deep down I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still hollow man. And seeing her with someone else kills me, just in a different way. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s either that or go back to feeling completely alone. And the thing is, no girl wants a guy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this down on himself and lacking in self-confidence.\n\nPeople always say that you need to love yourself before you can love someone else, but it feels like my flaw as a person is that I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t love myself unless I feel like someone else does. But nobody ever truly does. So I take the closest I can get and cling to it desperately, because if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just alone with myself. Why the fuck am I like this? I feel like my full life I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna go through this cycle over and over. It just sucks. I hate myself even more for being that asshole who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hopelessly into a girl with a boyfriend. I feel like one of those stupid \u00e2\u0080\u0098nice guys\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for even complaining about her not feeling the same. But I just wish that once somebody would feel for me the same way I feel for them. I look for that love thinking it will fix me, but honestly I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it would. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to fix it in all honesty.",

        "Origin_reddit": "~~I apologize if this does not qualify for this subreddit, but I don't know of a better place to talk about this.~~\n\nI never felt like my family truly loved me. They say they do, but all the times that they interact with me feel fake, like they're just pretending to like me for appearances. This is what my gut is telling me, but I don't know if it's reliable.\n\nI wonder if I'm a sociopath. Everyone loves their family, right? So why can't I?\n\nI hate a certain half sister of mine because, growing up, she would always call me names, make fun of me, and just generally treat me like garbage. But anyone I would complain about this to never thought this was anything to complain about. They would be like \"Oh, that's just how sisters are\" and \"Oh, I understand. Me and my siblings fought a lot too, but we still love each other.\"\n\nThe thing is, I can say with confidence that I DON'T love my sister. At best, I'm indifferent to her. At worst, I want to kill her. But I certainly do not \"love\" her.  I told her this and...it apparently made her cry.\n\nWait...are you serious? You expected me to love you after the way you've treated me my whole life? Am I crazy to not love being bullied? Am I just weak for not being able to tolerate this so called \"typical sibling banter\"??? I need answers, damn it!!\n\nThen there's my father. He's...an asshole. He just is. I really don't feel like getting into how he's an asshole, since I just got through talking about my sister. But anyway...\n\n Unlike my sister, nobody denies that he's an asshole. However, I am expected to put up with him anyway. Because my father is 71 years old (turning 72 next month), he has been deemed \"a product of his time\" and therefore is allowed to be an asshole because old people are too old to listen and therefore\n I should \"pity him\" because \"he's a lonely old man\". \n\nBut here's the thing: I DO pity him. Of course I do, he's a pathetic human being. But pity =/= tolerate, which is what they're implying when they tell me this. I don't know why they expect me to tolerate this outdated piece of human history when obviously the best option is to throw him in a museum (retirement home) and let him expire. I don't know how I'm an asshole for feeling this way, but I guess I just am.\n\nThose are the main two people that I hate out of this family, but I honestly don't care for any of them. I never felt like I truly belonged in this family. I was always \"the quiet one\" that everyone ignored. I often fantasize about ditching these people and moving to another part of the country, and meet people that I can \"truly connect with\", but of course that'll never happen.  For one, \"truly connecting\" with people would require me to socialize, and I'm as asocial as they come. Two, I'm such an emotionally weak, weak-willed, codependent piece of crap that the very idea of moving away and being all alone is too much for me to bear.  \n\nI'm sure I probably just sound like a whiny spoiled brat to you all.You're probably wondering: If I don't have the guts to ditch them, why don't I just deal with them? Well, they clearly never wanted to deal with me all my life, so why should I?.......................Right?...RIGHT???\n\nI don't know... What am I saying? I don't even know what I want...\n\nObviously, there's something I don't like about my family, but I don't know what it is, so nothing will ever change...... What if there's actually nothing wrong with them?....What if I'M the problem? What If I'm just a horrible person that will never be satisfied no matter what I do? If I can't be satisfied with what I have, do I just not deserve happiness? I don't know when I became so terrible....Wasn't I always like this? They say no one is born evil, but...look at me....\n\nI'm not sure why I typed all of this out, I doubt anyone will read it...and if you did, sorry for wasting your time...\n\n\n\n",

        "Origin_reddit": "I apologize for the long/whiny post but I need to vent.  Hopefully this helps clear my head so I can get some sleep tonight. \n\nAbout a week ago I was talking with a friend (I will call him Derek) and the topic of New Year's came up. I told Derek that I did not have any plans at which point his girlfriend (Kim) suggested that I join them on a trip up north to hang out with her friend (Sara), whom Kim tried to set me up with about a year ago but I was just not in a good place to start dating and within a few weeks she was dating someone else (Ken).  At this time Derek let me know that Kim wanted to set us up again. I recently, about three weeks ago, I got the dreaded \"I just want to be friends\" from another woman that I had been hanging out with for a little over a month.  This made me a little hesitant since it had not been too long since the rejection, but I agreed to go.  The plan was to go up Sunday afternoon, stay the night at Sara's, and leave Monday morning.\n\nFast forward to the Sunday night and we are at a house part hosted by one of Sara's friends.  It is still early and I find myself talking with Kim at the party, Kim is asking me if I am interested in Sara and I tell her I am.  She gets a huge smile on her face as she was talking with Sara earlier and she was interested in me.  At this point my head is going crazy, I am probably the happiest I have been in years, I start to think finally something good is happening.  Midnight comes around and Sara and I are standing next to each other, the countdown ends and for some reason I cannot pull the trigger and kiss her.  I am an idiot. \n\nOf course, the party continues and I go outside with Derek to smoke a cigarette (cope) thinking that I blew it with this awesome girl.  We come back in and mingle with the other party-goers.  I find myself talking with Sara alone, we talk for a while and then in the middle of our conversation she leans in a kisses me.  I am back on cloud nine, I didn't screw this up.  It is about 1:00 AM now and we head out as Sara has to be to work at 5:00 AM.  \n\nWe get back to Sara's place and start getting ready for bed, I am in Sara's room with her as Kim and Derek climb onto the air mattress in the living room, the original sleeping arrangements were for Kim to sleep in Sara's room on an air mattress and Derek and I were to sleep on a couch and air mattress in the living room.  So there Sara and I are sitting on her bed and we say goodnight, and she looks at the air mattress that was setup on her floor.  I get the hint and climb in, I don't think too much of it as this is the first night that we have really hung out and the fact that she has to wake up in 2.5 hours.\n\nThe next morning; Kim, Derek, and I wake up and clean up Sara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house.  We decide that we should grab some breakfast before heading home, Kim texts Sara to see if she would like us to bring her anything which she does.  It dawns on me that in all of the excitement of the night I never asked Sara for her number, I am determined to get it before leaving.  We get to Sara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office and head in, she is there with one other coworker.  As we say our goodbyes she hugs me and then as I am about to ask for her number someone says something to her and she looks away.  I lose all the confidence that I had to ask and leave.  \n\nThe drive home is hell, all I can think about is how I missed my chance after what was probably the best night off my life in 10 years.  Kim drops Derek and myself off at Derek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and he asks me why I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask her for her number I tell him that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to ask in front of her coworker, which is half true.  He says that he will talk to Kim who will in turn talk to Sara and send me her number.  I hate this as it is like I am back in high school but it is the only option I have.  \nI do not hear back from Derek on Monday night and my head goes straight to the worse possible reason, Sara wants nothing to do with me.  I talk myself down from that scenario as Derek and I had made plans for Tuesday.  Tuesday comes around and Derek and I hang out, I do not bring up anything with Sara the entire time until it is time to leave.  I ask Derek if Kim had talked to her and he breaks the news; Ken, Sara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ex, is moving back to town.  This is information that Kim knew prior to inviting me, but she does not want Sara to get back together with Ken so she was hoping that we would hit it off and that she would not want to get back with her ex.  \n\n\nSo now here I am, feeling awful, rejected two times in a month.  How could something be going so right and end so abruptly?  I am not sure if Sara wants to get back together with her ex or as I was told her ex coming back to town is just messing with her head and she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to get hurt again.  Kim and Derek said that they would talk with her and let me know but now I feel like I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even try anymore, it always ends the same.",

I'm heavily addicted to benzos and drinking(more so benzos). It's the only thing that stops the nasty thoughts. The pills are the only thing that make my awful thoughts stop. Every day I think of a way I could potentially kill myself. But I've never acted on it. But I'm afraid I might have the balls to do it one of these days and end this constant suffering. My mind is pitch black. The lights are on, but nobody's home. I'm a ghost. I'm a shell of the person I used to be. \n\nJust wanted to get this off my chest. Any replies are greatly appreciated.

I have been treated for my ADHD with various doses of Vyvanse for the past several years and I currently am prescribed 50 mg.\n\nI abused and misused my medication this summer. Going back to school, I was no longer able to do that and I had to go back to my intended dosage. The adjustment was very difficult, and I completely withdrew from friends, would sleep excessively (5/3pm-6am most nights), and felt very fatigued and indifferent for about a month until I finally got used to being back on that dose. Still not sure if what I was feeling was withdrawal or not\n\nI have never brought this up with my mental health provider in fear of losing her trust and fear of being taken off Vyvanse. \n\nOn December 8th my father died. I had a very difficult relationship with him and a complicated childhood as a whole (alcoholism, parents weren't around, all that stuff). He lived in another country at the time of his passing, so I missed the last weeks of school to be with his family in his home country and I arrived back in the states on Xmas. \n\nI cannot be around my friends without Vyvanse. I zone out in my own thoughts, I resent them and find no joy in being around them. I feel so disconnected and alone from them, even though they are supportive.  On New Years, I was at a close friends get together and I felt like this and I went to the bathroom and for the first time had intense urges to self-harm. Called home, left the party, and got drunk alone instead.\n\nI feel like I live in these two worlds as who I am medicated and who I am not medicated.

When I'm not on Vyvanse, I'm dissatisfied with everyone and everything around me, including myself. the only time I'm happy is when im on amphetamines. \n\ni cannot sleep anymore and I get about two hours every night. no sex drive at all and I am losing all my friends.

I was the only child and I didn't do fairly well in school and waking up early when my body for some odd reason decides to default to sleeping like a backwards human being didn't help either. It was the first time I had heard about all of my symptoms being that of someone with \"depression.\" Mental illness is not a universally/well-spoken about topic where my parents came from so naturally came the \"How can you be so lazy, how can you get such bad grades when we're trying so hard to put a plate of food in front of you.\" \n\nThings got worse when I dove into self-harm because at the very least it was some kind of relief. My family doctor found out accidentally while giving me a regular health check up. I was interviewed and I could feel my doctor's spite. The anger resonated with my mother and she reacted in anger saying: \"I don't know why she even does that!\" And came the car ride, \"If you hate your life so much why don't you just die.\" \n\nAnd I almost believed that she meant that and I spent hours crying on the kitchen floor. My mother is the only person I can usually trust, I felt like what was even the point. \n\nBefore we left the doctor's office I was threatened to go see someone and that there would be an issue if they found out I didn't schedule for one. My mom and I both sat in the car and she bargained with me explaining that if I were to go to a therapist, they'd mark my records as a mentally ill person and that I'd never find a job. \n\nAfter that I tried my best to cope with it. But then I broke one day. I was having an argument with my mother and it was the first time ever she had physically smacked me across the face. I was mortified and I broke down in my closet. It was the first time I had felt unable to control my own body. It was then my mother decided to give me a listen to the issues I was going through. \n\nAfter I calmed down, I explained to her what depression really was and how it feels and what I can and can't do sometimes. She sympathized with me but I didn't think about therapy after that. I told myself I'd eventually go. \n\nI'm a 3rd year into college now and it's over break.

I decided I needed a change, and wanted to finally move out. I went to my family and decided to tell them my plan to move out which they thought I definitely should not do that way I could finish college. While we were having the conversation I began to tear up and my stepmom (who is like a second mother to me) asked me why I was getting emotional about it. I didn't really know why I was but I decided that I couldn't really hide it anymore. I told my parents I was depressed and suicidal and they both began crying. This was a shock to me because I have always felt as if I was more of a drain on them than anything else. It was extra surprising because I had never seen my dad cry, over anything, and I truthfully thought my dad was ashamed to have me as a son. They began telling me how much they loved me, and my dad even told me that he was proud of the man I've become, and I found out that my stepmom struggles with depression as well, and has taken medication for it and says she feels a lot better because of it.

In the back of my mind I know that I could replace this person with essentially anyone and I would still feel the same, but I'm just fixated on this one person. \nDoes anyone know how to be more comfortable being alone? I always end up putting so much time and effort into these crushes that don't mean anything to me.

Been through a devastating medical issues, three close friends died recently, lost my job and my health care and the fucking holidays are shit. Mostly my friends leave me alone, but a few have actually gotten angry at me for not paying attention to them. They say, \"Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.\" and when I say, \"Buy my meds,\" they say no. \"Help me clean my house.\" they say they can't. Etc. When they keep blathering this shallow bullshit at me, demanding my attention and then get mad when I remind them that I already told them how to help and they said no. I just step away. But I feel like I should have something to say to them that sets them straight. Wondering if anyone else has dealt with anything like this. Thanks.",

We're still friends, but I can't stop thinking about her and regretting letting it happen. She is what I think about most of the day, and I am on the verge of coming back crying to her asking her to forgive me and give me another chance. She was the only one that cared about me, that didn't put me down. Even though I had many failings she still said she loved me, even after my best friend's put me down for being dumb. She was the only one that treated me as an equal and not a second rate citizen to be laughed at or to be disappointed with. \n\nI started uni this year. I've had fun but made close to no friends and it feels really superficial. I don't know if I like it but there's no way I can go back now, my parents will fucking disown me even if I try, even though I'm at a second rate uni wasting my time. The people I talk to most are still my friends from school and my now ex. I cry myself to sleep most nights. I am never happy. I tried getting help from my email by applying for councilling but they took a month to reply and when I turned up there was no one there. \n\nI am so lonely. I have no more will to continue. I can't end it but if I could I would. The weather makes me feel like shit. The success of all my friends compared to how much of a fucking FAILURE I am makes me feel like shit. I have no one to turn to. Most nights I can't even sleep and when I do only for a few hours at a time. I will do shit in my exams. I still go through life but I feel like an empty vessel. My parents are disappointed in me. My younger sister makes fun of me. People avoid me.\n\nI try to be an interesting person and someone to invite to parties but it just seems whatever I do people reject me. I just want this to end. I want to be happy and live life. This is meant to be the best time of my life, so why is the best thing in my life the fact that I got a decent amount of karma on a post on my main? How fucking pathetic do I have to be to actually be proud of that?\n\nI just want to start life again and have a second chance at everything so I won't be just a fucking disgrace anymore.

I caught her getting almost daily voicemails left on her phone by a guy I was clear I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t okay with the flirting with.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been reflecting over those moments the last few weeks and I have finally accepted the fact I need help. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always thought I could do things on my own and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s help. However last year showed me I can win battles on my own but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never win the war without people supporting me. So I decided to try to let people into my life this year and let them help me when they offer it. Also I just want to try to be more social in general.  To start out I decided to make a Facebook account since people always seem to ask me that and I always say I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have one. Ironically when I tried signing up it said my name wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t real. Haha can you believe it oh god truly has a sense of humor. Anyway as soon as I got there I started seeing my friends accounts and their friends and even though I knew some these people for some reason I got the feeling I always get when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m around a lot of people. The feeling of not belonging. I hate this feeling and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably because I spent so much time isolates from other people but I never seem to feel like I fit in even with friends. I look at the whole thing and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not for me. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like these people are happy they have lives they care about others. They put themselves out on the internet for everyone to see where as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a more personal type of guy. They are normal human beings and at times I honestly question wether I even am human. Anyway it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weird just wanted to put this out there. ",
