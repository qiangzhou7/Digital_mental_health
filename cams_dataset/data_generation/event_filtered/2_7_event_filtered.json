I go to school full time as well. I technically don't HAVE to work, but i feel useless if i don't. I guess the point of this post is, does anyone have any advice on how to keep a job with depression?

        "Origin_reddit": "(This is a comment I posted yesterday that kind of explains my life right now and I was hoping maybe if I post it here I can just talk to someone about it.)\n\nI just want my life to feel worth living honestly. \n\nI'm embarrassed by my body so I'm trying to gain weight and move my 150lbs to 180lbs to gain a little bit REAL confidence so I dont have to fake it all the time. I've got a healthy diet and workout routine going, but until I'm at my desired weight I just feel weak and unattractive all the time.\n\nI just graduated highschool early 2016 and have decided to not go to college. It was four years worth of time in making that choice and weighing my options, now I made the choice and am wondering if I chose wrong. My business is going no where and I am running low on the little funds I have left. I can see my parents empathy for the unemployed graduate is starting to run a little thin too.\n\nOn average I wake up depressed 5/7 days of the week and go to sleep every single night wondering where my life is going and how I can manage to reach my goals and dreams. Happiness comes and goes, but 9 times out of 10 I'm just putting on a show. Nothing I'm not familiar with though. That's what my whole fucking life has been. A damn show. Now I'm not saying I've had it bad. My family is kind and loving. And I grew up relatively middle class. What I am saying is that as soon as I started highschool my life became fake. I put on this character so people will think I'm okay when I'm really not. \n\nI lie to my family and tell them that everything is going fine and that \"Business is great! I'm not depressed at all! Wow yesterday was so much fun sitting at home all alone with no one to talk to and only my thoughts to remind me of how much of a failure I've been recently!\" I'm too damn proud to admit that I have no clue what I'm doing and the last thing I want them to do is worry. Not like it matters anyways. My dad can see my bank account slowly dropping day by day. I tell him I have funds in my paypal, but I'm not sure if he believes that anymore.\n\nEveryone knows I'm failing at life right now too. Whenever someone asks about my job my parents and friends never say that I'm a photographer, or a video editor, or a writer, or a musician. It's always \"well he's just taking some time off right now.\" Or \"yeah he's unemployed.\" Or \"He doesn't really do anything.\" Or worst of all \"Oh he's just having fun messing around with a little photography.\" Really? Messing around? So practicing my craft for 6 years and now trying to run a business is just messing around. Well shit I guess they're right. It's not like I'm making any damn money doing this anyways. Today I officially shut it down. Everyone seems to think that all it is is a hobby so maybe that's how I should keep it. I just applied for a few shitty, monotonous 9-5s, the things I told myself I would never do and I feel like I sold out all my values. I've given up everything I stand for and I've given up on myself. I highly doubt I'll even get the jobs anyways. No one wants to hire someone with past experience as \"summer lifeguard\" and \"photographer\".\n\nStress eats away at my health constantly. If depression isnt causing me to oversleep and then not even feel restes than stress is keeping me awake. I'm eighteen fucking years old. Eighteen. You wanna know what my blood pressure was on the last time I checked? 141/90. I eat relatively healthy, and try to exercise daily and my blood pressure is 141/90.\n\nAnd don't get me started on dating. Oh damn am I fucked up. Aside from the fact that I have these unrealistic standards for girls I can't even get in a relationship. I've been in four relationships in my life so far right? Girl #1 broke up with me (she ended up figuring out she was a lesbian so kudos to her and no hard feelings on this one). #2 three months, cheated. #3 seven months, cheated. Took her back, cheated again. #4 same shit as #3. I went to one highschool dance. My senior prom. The minute we walked in she said bye and walked off with some other dude to dance. Now I've got these trust issues and on top of that I only chase unhealthy relationships. I get so close to a relationship with someone good then just lose interest because now it's not a chase anymore. What the hell is wrong with me?!\n\nI thought that I could prove people wrong. I thought that maybe they weren't right. Maybe I'm not some fucking loser with no talents. Maybe my dreams aren't stupid and unachievable. Maybe once I graduate, I can show everyone that doubted me that I actually can do it and prove to everyone that following your dreams is an option! Well maybe in reality, that's just something you tell the stupid little kid who thinks he can be whatever he wants so he'll just shut up and leave you alone. \n\nI'm tired of people lying to me and saying \"You can do it! Don't give up! Dreams do come true!\" I've been putting in the work and got shit. Countless days and nights of no sleep trying to find that next job or making that project perfect. Dreams are just that. Fucking dreams, and that's where they need to stay. The only reason people think they can do anything is because they see a select few people that happened to be at the right place at the right time for a payoff. It doesn't matter if you've worked your ass off or if you just started yesterday, because in the end, all that matters is if you were lucky enough to roll the dice on the time they decided to land in your favor.\n\nEveryday I wake up, put on this 'mask' and make people think I'm happy so that maybe they can trick me into thinking I'm happy too. The problem is now, is that it's not working anymore.\n\nTo top it all off, I don't feel entitled or like I'm allowed to feel depressed. I'm not homeless, not raised in a bad situation, I'm white in America. I feel like if I tell anyone about this all I'm gonna get is a \"get over it\" kind of response.",

This all culminated into a bad back injury from lifting a 12x12 with a coworker when the coworker slipped and I tried to compensate which made me slip a disc. I was bullied into not filling for workers comp and put on light duty for 2 weeks, this all happened around the time I was finally supposed to get my apprenticeship. Instead I was laid off, to which no one told me until I drove the hour to work but everyone seemed to know the day before. \n\nSo this is the embarrassing part, I had a mental breakdown in my truck then drove home crying. I was so frustrated so angry. I should have gone then and there to the competitor in town and applied for a job, but I couldn't bring myself to so I took a few days for myself and started applying for more entry level trade jobs. Now if you haven't been in or tried to get into a trade, most of the time the only way your going to even get a interview is if you know someone who works for the company. Which unfortunately I was 20 at the time and just starting out, so of course I didn't know anyone in the trade. And then whole oil glut/oligarchy thing happened which made it even harder. \n\nSo I did that for a year, had to move back with my parents, my parents gave me shit when I tried to sell my truck  and they took on the payments. I shouldn't have let them I know, it made me feel so shitty and it still does. So then summer hits and my best friends family owns a helicopter company and this was a big fire year in my province, so he asked me if I could give him a hand so I did. I wish I could still work for them, I didn't think people could be so nice at a workplace. Then summer ended and  they didn't need me anymore, so I went back to looking. Then last winter I slipped and slipped my disc again only this time was much worse and I was laid up for 6 months doing pt, getting injections and seeing a chiropractor. \n\nNow I've been out of work with almost nothing to show for my time for so long and I have nothing to put on my resume. I did do a few courses to try and get something but that didn't pan out. I have my h2s, csts, first aid and forklift and zoomboom tickets. I just want to live, not exist.

I feel like such a failure, I tried my hardest I really did I swear I'm not lazy I'm trying, please I just want to be a person again. \n\nIf you read all that, thank your for taking the time to it really means a lot to me.

        "Origin_reddit": "Good day everyone!\n\nI have decided to write my story here, since it seems that there might be some people here who might relate to me and maybe give insight.\n\nTLDR: I am a 25 year old male who is enjoying his life, but constantly feels that he is doing more negative than positive things day-to-day in his life.\n\nSo going back to the story. As said above in the TLDR i have this weird feeling that i am doing more negative things in my life than positive things day-to-day and i can't seem to shake it off. Let me clarify that feeling, every day when i wake up i feel i am doing more things I DON'T WANT TO DO and LESS THINGS I WANT TO DO! No i am not depressed (at least i think i am not), no i am not sad, but this feeling makes me empty. It all started when i went to college for Bachelors degree. Before that everything seemed fine and i was doing more positive things in life than negative ones. My Bachelors degree went smoothly, i got the degree, i got a decent job (above average pay where i live), i wen't on to Masters degree and from the get go (starting from Bachelors degree) i have this urgency, that i do more things i don't want to do day-to-day and i get no pleasure from it.\n\nLet me bring you an example. I wake up, i go to work. This part i enjoy. Now everything falls apart after work. I have to do this Masters degree and i feel like this is a complete and utter chore to do. Although everyone expect that i must finish this, so i have this pressure on me, that i have to finish this and i want to, but i feel like i am a prison in my own jail. I would gladly workout or hangout with friends, but i can't because from the morning to evening i am at work and after evening till night (sometimes even to 02:00 or 03:00) i do school stuff. I have already burned out once before (where i failed hard on some assignments) and i decided to take less workload. Still i feel like i am always overwhelmed and i can't seem to find free time to be who i want to be, but rather i feel like i have to complete these chores.\n\nThen there is this another thing. I don't get enough respect from others although when problems arise, everyone are running to me for help. For an example, i am an engineer and the university where i am is expanding in the field where i work. I offered my help for anything the answer was \"You should get more experience before offering help\" from the director. After that i was quite confused, because i have been working on my speciality for over 3 years, i have a Bachelors degree, i am looking forward for my Masters degree and when i offer a friendly helping hand i get scolded for no apparent reason. Also when they need some materials from the workplace i work for, then everyone are running for me to ask help.\n\nThis helping is expanding to other things as well in life. When my friends are in need of help (lending money or anything else) then everyone are running to me, but i get no credit for it. For one friend i helped him to get a great job opening through my connections and then he was \"Yeah man, thanks for helping me, i will throw you a party\" of course this party never happened and i never got a thanks for it, rather that just thank you and goodbye.\n\nAlso at workplace i often get the same \"Disrespect\" treatment from older engineers (since i am a young guy) then i also provide new ideas, new innovative approaches and i seem to never get any respect for it. I have brought new ideas which have improved some systems and then its like \"Well its obvious thanks for the help\", but sometimes i get scolded for no apparent reason like the same from the director. Is this like some kind of an age thing? I don't understand or am i just an idiot.\n\nBut the main thing although is this school thing, that some of my classmates who are not even working in their speciality full-time are going more to school and getting more praises like scholarships, director is happy with them and me who is working as a full-time engineer, gets scolded, gets said like \"Get more experience\" although others who have never worked in their speciality. Is this like some kind of an academid circle-jerk they are doing to me? No i am not a fricking loser loner nerd guy, i am quite a self confident guy, but this just makes me so angry that i provide the university materials and experience from my workplace and i get scolded for working and not being full-time academic student? How does this even be logical?\n\nOeh there are many more things which i could write, but i don't want to drag this out if anyone has any questions or wants to discuss, i would happily open up more.\n\nThank you,\nI just wanted to write this out!",

I planned to move back in w/ my parents and try to improve myself and eventually transfer to a new school, but I feel stuck.  It's already been a month and I've done nothing.

I can feel my parents getting restless, and they keep asking me what my plan is and all I can say is \"I don't know yet\".

It sucked but I had to tell my boss that I had to quit after the Saturday before. He knew that I was getting a new job so I didn't just spring this on him. I hated telling him I had to start on Monday.\n\nMonday rolls around and the new job tells me they don't need me until a week later. I didn't have my old job to go back to since they had already taken me out of the system. So yay, I was screwed out of a weeks pay. \n\nI finally did get to work the following week. Now, I don't have a car of my own. New job said they would work with me and either pick me up from my home or have me walk a few blocks to be picked up. Since November I have only worked a total of two weeks. I don't have a car to just drive around and look for jobs nor do I have a friend that can drive me around (I don't even know what a friend is anymore). \n\nNew job hasn't had any work for me for the past two weeks and they are saying they are keeping us till the 13th. I have a phone bill I have to pay in a few weeks plus give my roommate rent. He also works for new job and is also having a hard time as well since he has no car.\n\nI simply do not have the money to buy a car or even a down payment. I wish I knew what to do or where to go. I can't help but once again think about the life I had before last June. I had a family, a car and a wife. I still have a bit of resentment towards her because when she left me she want to her parents and they immediately helped her get a car. We lost our old car because we were behind on payments and I was borrowing a car from a friend of her family until she left then they guy suddenly needed it back...\n\nI'm just super worried about everything. I don't have a single way out of this house. I feel like this is my prison. I'm here with roommates who all they want to do is get high (I have no problems with smoking by the way) and play video games. I enjoy gaming myself, but I don't want that to just be my life.

After graduating, I thought life would finally start being fun and enjoyable, I had worked so hard to finally be over with it and I was full of dreams and motivation. Fast forward 2 years later, I tried everything I could, from starting my own business to working at a restaurant, working in software development job (I graduated in Computer Science), working as a guide, acting, and every time it's the same, I end up hating my job and my life and quit. At this point I feel like I've lost all my motivation to do anything, I don't know what I want to do and no matter how much I look for a passion I can't find one. I'm currently employed and I hate my job, just thinking about it makes me want to kill myself. Everybody thinks I'm doing great because I go to the gym, learn foreign languages, play music, got good grades at school, but work makes me so fucking depressed that all I can think of is ending everything. I love to learn languages but that doesn't make any money, translation makes money but I hate it and want to kill myself just thinking about it. I love watching anime, listening to music, playing music, eating good food, seeing a nice scenery, but none of that makes money, and with no money I'm homeless, and I'd rather die than be homeless, but working makes me want to kill myself. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on how you look at it, I have a good family who I most definitely do not want to harm and thus suicide is absolutely out of the question, I could never forgive myself if I went through with it. So here I am, hating my life and wanting to kill myself every day but unable to do so because I do not want to cause harm to my family. It's like I'm in jail although I'm perfectly healthy (at least physically) and free (in theory). I just wish I was never born, I wouldn't be in this situation and everything would be so much easier.

What if he believes me but decides I'm not mentally capable of staying on the course? Not to mention the huge fear I have that he'll just blow up at me, which I highly doubt is going to happen because he's a very nice person, but I still worry about stuff like that. \n\nThanks for reading this anyone, advice would be amazing right now. :3 ",

The company's a successful growth company.\n\nI have liked to work there, but there are some problems. I had a conversation with my bosses about my performance, and they said that they're not sure if I will get to continue there after the test period.\n\nI don't mind criticism, I know I can do better, but f.ex. right now I've been in a flu for about 3 weeks, and my boss has suggested that I shouldn't have a day off even though I would feel like it.\n\nEverything about this situation makes me feel pressurised, and I wake up every morning feeling reluctant to go to work. It's not nice to feel like every day matters at work, when normal routines are starting to feel like effort.\n\nWhen I get home from work, I usually just slob on the couch and watch comedies or other funny videos to feel better. I sleep quite ok, could do with a few more hours.\n\nI'm grateful to have gotten an opportunity to work in such a successful company. After all, in these times, even getting work is not certain.\n\nI have been depressed before. At that time, I was just 18 and trying to figure out what the hell was I doing. Ended up quitting my job then.\n\nTl;dr: I work at a successful place, just moved in with gf. Felling pressure to do more at work, and at the same time feeling I should have time with myself. Would appreciate tips on how to get over this feeling.\n",

It's like the depression messes with anything that actually goes good in my life. I've had past relationships ruined, jobs, family ties. \n\nJust trying to get a discussion on sabotaging yourself and if others have this issue.",
