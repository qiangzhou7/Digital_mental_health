        "Origin_reddit": "Hi there. Sorry this is a bit long. I'm looking for some advice or words of wisdom on how to cope with a severely depressed and suicidal best friend.\n\nWe've been best friends since high school. We went to different colleges, but she ended up transferring to my school (huge state school) this year. It's been hard on her -- she hasn't made many friends. I hung out with her often and always invited her out with my friends, but I think she feels uncomfortable joining and my friends find her to be annoying. She's been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as I've known her and has been consistently in therapy. She thought she was bipolar, but recently found out that she actually has borderline personality disorder and her parents/doctors have known for years. I think this makes her even more depressed.\n\nThis year she got really into xanax and was constantly barred out. I don't fuck with drugs for a lot of reasons and she is always pressuring me to try them, so I feel very uncomfortable around her when she's super messed up. One night she showed up at my dorm at 3am and passed out in the hallway after taking 7 bars and mixing it with alcohol. I took her to the emergency room and she stayed at the hospital for several days in the psychiatric ward. She doesn't get along with her family and refused to let her parents visit her or make any medical decisions. During this time, I was the only person she would contact so I brought her everything she needed, visited multiple times daily, helped her get excuses for all her classes, etc. \n\nAfter this incident she promised she was done with xanax. I know now that she continued to abuse it almost daily, but was more secretive about it. She went out and partied every weekend, acting like everything was fine. She got fired from her job (we work together) and failed all her exams. She found out that she's pregnant and doesn't know who the father is, and asked me to come with her to get an abortion. She told me she was going to take the next semester off and try to figure things out. She blamed me for encouraging her to transfer and not being there for her. In hindsight, I know I could have done more to help her adjust to the new school, but she repeatedly told me she didn't like my friends and wanted to make her own. \n\nShe hooked up with my ex boyfriend when she was blacked out. I forgave her because I know she doesn't remember it and wouldn't have done it sober, but it still upsets me when I think about it.\n\nTwo days ago she tried to kill herself. She drank half a bottle of vodka and took 20+ different types of pills. She sent me a suicide note via text in which  she wanted me to send paragraphs she'd written to multiple different people. There was a note for me at the end-- she said that I \"was never there for her\" and that she feels sorry for me because I'm more \"fucked up\" than she is and I don't even realize it. \n\nI called her immediately, got her to send me her location, and then called 9-1-1 and her parents. When the ambulance got there, she was foaming at the mouth and they said she would have died within 20-30 minutes. Her mom has been keeping me updated the past two days. She woke up today and luckily doesn't have any brain damage. She's been asking to talk to me but doesn't have access to her phone and doctors won't let her speak or visit with any non-family members.\n\nI just don't know what to do. The past six months have been hell for her, but also for me. She hasn't been there as a friend at all, which is completely understandable given the situation, but I've found myself becoming more distant from her. She tells me that I'm the best friend she's ever had, and then the next day says everyone else is telling her to not be my friend because I'm such a shitty person? I feel like I'm becoming depressed myself now. My therapist told me that the friendship is toxic. Everyone thinks I'm crazy for sticking by her. But all  her other friends have abandoned her. I see how much pain she's in, and I know she would do the same for me. At the same time I don't think I can keep this up much longer. I'm still her best friend, but she's no longer mine.\n\nIt makes me so sad to think about all of the good memories we have together. Would a true friend stand by her through this, even though she doesn't seem to want me to? I don't ever want to be in this situation again where her life is in my hands. Any advice/input would be greatly appreciated.",

I have a daughter so I dont want to do anything that will make it harder for her. But I dont know what else to do. I dont know if Im codependent on this misery or what. I know every day I wake up its going to be more of the same. I hate feeling this way. I want to be happy and alive and 'me' again. But so much has happened and Im going to be 43 this month. Why should I keep trying to find solutions? By the time I fix what needs fixing...even if I can, Ill be to old to enjoy any of it. Im tired of living a life of pain and suffering. I mask it with smoking weed or meds. It seems like I just lose more as I go on. Friends pass away from disease or suicide, family members pass on. I am struggling with wether or not to end my life. I wonder if I should look for easy ways to do it. I keep thinking about it but the ways I envision all seem like horrible ways to go out and Ive been through enough pain. Why should I try to hang on again? I wish that I mattered. Or that I was important enough for someone to care. After 20 years of ptsd and the anxiety and depression Im in a place where Im unable to work or provide for myself. I dont know if I do or dont want disability or if I can even get it. I grew up cutting down trees, building houses and raising horses and what not. My pride is something that comes up over and over. Ive been out of work for over 5 years. Ive been kept isolated for most of that and its one thing to have therapy and medicine. But Im still stuck here dependent on someone who has abused me. But maybe I should give them more time. I know Im not perfect. I have my own issues. Maybe Im just screwing everything up with this line of thinking. But I do know that I am co dependent. After all the abuse and nightmares and the pain, I dont know if I will ever be able to live the life I want to. Why would I choose to stay like this? I dont want to keep going like this. This isnt how its supposed to be. Life and the world around us really does fascinate me and I always wanted to find a place in it. But after all this time of being cut off from it I cant keep coming up with reasons to just keep hurting. I dont want to have to keep coming back and doing things like this as a last ditch effort.  I used to be so resilient and able to bounce back, nowadays im just so worn out and tired and drained.  Life keeps dangling a carrot in front of my face.  And like a fool I try to chase it, just to to find more pain.  Im tired of trying.  Im tired of feeling like Im damned.  I dont want to get on here and make a post like this for attention.  I just DONT want to feel like this anymore.  And its getting worse and harder to deal with.  If there was a button I could push that would end it painlessly I wonder if i would press it.  When its like this I wonder why in the hell I wouldnt press it.  There were things I wanted to do with my life.  Things I was sure that I was here to do.  And now it seems my whole lifes purpose was just to suffer.  I still feel like that little boy who was beaten bloody as a kid and taught to live in fear.  Why is it that he cant get justice?  Life was suppose to be somuch fuller and more beautiful.  But for me, my mind is under attack more often than not.  I have been doing all I can for years now, Id be lying if I said some things havent gotten better.  But at this rate Ill never get there in time.  And Ive been doing it on my own with little to no help while other people are working against me.  When will it get better?  When do the good things start happening?  When can I rest?",

Coming out is never an option at it would DESTROY my parents, and I love them so bad. \nThe main problem, I'm struggling with overcoming this \"love\" with my straight friend (For almost 3 years now, he just got married last year). As I learnt how to fake my feeling since I was a kid, I did it so well even now he still has no idea about (At least it's what I think). In the last two years I've been trying to keep the distance but still no use, the feeling just keeps getting stronger.  Ironically enough, all my life I've met so many people, but only have feeling for that only guy. Yep, the first ever, and only one til this day. Like a fucking joke, sounds romantic (if we remove the gender details) but so fucked up at the same time (as it actually is). Even worse, he sure loves me (like bro to bro). I did so many mean stuffs to keep the distance, things like replying K, being aggressive, ignoring his birthday, his new year message etc. very very mean, but the guy seems to be too patient with me, looks like he clearly wants us back to be best bro as we did before. Forgot to mention, we were co-worker for more than a year, then life happens, he moved abroad (This was when I decided to stop being nice to him - with hope of finding an escape for myself but failed :/), and later on, got married. That means there's been a real geographical distance between us as well - even that wouldn't do any good to my feeling.\nIt's such a shame to admit this but you guys can't imagine how many night I've lost sleep, crying all the tears I got, praying that god or any higher power up there, please erase me from this life, then the next day everyone would forget my existence and just move on. I want to die, but don't want to kill my parents selfishly. I'm tired of being alone, but then I can only fake my feeling to an extent, showing affection to a girl - that's too much for me. Would also do me no good for sure, I'm hungry for true happiness, something that can't be faked.\nI still go to work everyday, fake my laughter. I have a job that pays well, you can say I'm financial independent. But none of this matters soon, being the only son I MUST keep the family's bloodline going. But well, with this mess inside my head, I don't know what to do now. I've been thinking about confessing it all to him, maybe that will actually freak him out and I can finally move on? But, damn, so many but, the idea of actually losing him from my life forever scares the shit out of me. After all I'm this loser who can have his whole week brightened just by receiving a text \"hey\" from a bro I'm secretly in love, even though I'll just pretend to ignore it or reply with K.

        "Origin_reddit": "I'm fairly young, junior in high school , but I do not wish to disclose my age. My mom is a hardcore muslim, forcing her religion on me and all my sisters. My sisters are much older than I am...one is addicted to adderall, and two are depressed. I developed a drug and alcohol problem  in sophomore year of high school which escalated very quickly. I even almost overdosed off of a combination of xanax and alcohol.\n\nI used all these drugs and alcohol just because they were fun, not because I was depressed or sad or anything. My alcohol problem climaxed when I almost fought a police officer at a party when I was drunk. This led my mom to making me see a psychologist, and I genuinely felt bad for my substance abuse so I left drinking all at once.\n\nDuring the summer I became addicted to Xanax because I was terrified of my dad catching me drinking, that I just resorted to Xanax, as it is a cheap drunk. When school started in September, I had minor xanax withdrawal and I felt terrible. I started to drink moderately again.\n\nJust some more background... I feel like my dad genuinely dislikes me, and just tries to hide it up with fake conversations. All my sisters tell me my dad is a psycho when it comes to me. My dad always tries to turn my mom against me, calling me a manipulator and all types of shit. We have a shitty relationship as we aren't even close. My alcohol problem is misleading as I still get good grades in school, and I have very good studying habits. I strive so hard in school because I want to leave my shitty life behind\n\nMy life started to spiral out of control fast, and I became depressed, anxious, and restless. I partied every weekend and drank a lot, but my parents wouldn't catch me as I am good at acting sober. I started drinking on weekdays, and I started to feel so lonely. \n\nI finally met a girl, and not to sound corny, but I genuinely fell in love. She likes me a lot, and she actually makes me happy. For some reason she makes me anxious and restless too, so I started to have a harder drinking problem. I do not know why she gets me so restless, but I do know that it's really fucking us up. Because of my mood swings I always begin to flirt with her, getting her hopes up, and then I suddenly crash and I turn her down. I know I'm hurting her a lot, but I have so much shit going on in my life that it distracts me. I think I don't want to get too close to her for a fear of being left and hurt.\n\nMy life became hectic when my mom found beers in my room, and my parents realized my alcohol problem was still present. I know my mom genuinely cares, but her shoving religion in my throat gets me angrier, as I can't have a normal relationship with her because she only talks about school and religion. I know my dad on the other hand does not care about my drinking habit, but just that he wants to shit on me.\n\nWe had a family party I had to attend to, and I know this was a poor decision, but me and my family friend drank a little bit. I got breathalyzed by my dad when I came home, and I blew a .04. My dad promised he wouldn't tell my mom if I stopped drinking, and I made a deal. When my mom heard from someone that I was drinking, my dad quickly turned on me and texted my mom discretely about our deal. I confronted my dad and he blatantly lied to my face about it, even deleting the messages off his phone and showing it to me, acting like he never texted my mom. My mom gave up on me and said I was garbage with an alcohol problem, and it actually hurt me deeply\n\nI started drinking even harder as I felt my parents stopped caring for me, and my dad caught me with alcohol again, and they told me to leave the house. I was packing my bags, and my mom gave me a bunch of garbage bags. I was about to leave the house when my mom told me that if I left, I would never be allowed back in. I stayed home, and my mom said I was a disgrace and all that shit. I didn't care what she had to say, but she said I might have to go to rehab\n\nI know I have a drinking problem and a lot of psychological problems, but I think it's best I leave the house for a month. I have many friends houses to stay at, and I have enough money to live away from home for a month. I genuinely want to find peace in my life again, and I am in such a shit hole right now that it hurts to think about. I told my sister about leaving the house, and she never dismissed it, as she was kicked out the house for a month too. Is this the right way to find peace in my life again?\n\n",

        "Origin_reddit": "Okay so this is the story of how I had everything a 19 year could possibly want and how I lost it just as fast. I had everything. I had a loyal gf, I had a good paying job, a car, had lots of friends who I considered \"brothers\", I had a good relationship with my mom and sisters, I was going out every weekend having fun. Everything was perfect. I had never been so happy in my life. I was saving up for a newer car, for college, I was planning lots of great things for myself. I thought maybe I had finally gotten into the right track. I started hanging out with the wrong people though. I knew it was wrong but I didn't think I would ever get caught. We would go out at night and go through people's cars , steal whatever was valuable, credit cards, wallets, purses, electronics, guns, whatever we thought we could get money for. I was going on $1000 shopping sprees. One night I went out by myself and got caught. I was arrested, put in jail for 3 days and then I bonded out. My bond was $13,500 for 5 counts of felony entering auto, and 1 count of prowling. That's when my life flipped upside down. I know i put myself in that situation. I don't blame anyone else. Suddenly I had nothing. My friends I considered \"brothers\" didn't ever call to check up, they weren't even worried. So I had no friends now. No car. No money. (I hired a decent lawyer but she charged $4000). I lost my job in which I had just gotten a raise . I got a new one but it's a job I hate for less the money I was making back then. All my money goes to my lawyer, rent, and bills. I haven't bought myself anything in over 4 months. I'm not a citizen of the United States so if my lawyer can't drop find a way to drop the charges then I'm going to get deported back to Colombia where I was born. I haven't been there in 15 years since I was 4. So now I had the stress of not even knowing if I was going to be able to stay in the country with my mom and 4 sisters. If I was going to be able to stay with my girlfriend. I had no way of seeing her because I didn't have a car, no money to take her out, no friends to go out with. So I started pushing her away, avoiding texts, avoiding calls, avoiding chances to meet up. I knew how much she loved me, she was head over heels, I've never seen someone love me so much. But I didn't want her to fall more and then me get deported. That would have crushed her. So I continued pushing her away, every argument I would suggest breaking up. So one day I just did it , I broke up with her. Blocked her on all social media. I miss her tho but she is already talking to someone else. Now that I'm trying to meet new people I can't seem to be genuinely interested in. What they tell me about them and about their lives. I want to care. But I just don't. I want to be social, and active and positive and all these good things but I just can't. It's always in the back of my head. A little voice telling me, what's the point of getting to know them, what's the point of texting them back ? You're going to get deported in a couple months anyways. I talk to a girl for 1-2 days and then I stop talking to them all together . I don't even find joy in things that I used to love, like soccer , I tell myself what's the point in going. To go play if you're gonna get deported in a couple months. I want to be able to live productively , positively, I want to just live but this court case is holding me back. The thought of this impending doom in holding me back and I'm letting life pass in front of me. Idk what to do. ",

I just have this feeling of general loss, I'm 22 turning 23 in June. I live at home with my dad, I have no idea where my mom is, and that's fine. My parents went through a 8+ year divorce and I think it messed me up. I was 8 at the time, my mother was incredibly abusive to us. I still remember her choking my sister over the bathroom tub. It's something I don't think I'll ever forget. I spent those 8 years constantly moving from house to house apartment to apartment. I finally just stopped unpacking my things \n\nI was always described as the happy kid. Of course I was happy, I was fat as fuck. I had to smile or I probably would've killed myself in middle school, I certainly told myself enough times I was going to. Kids are fucking ruthless. I think it's fair to say I cried a lot up until high school. I lost that weight in high school, busted my ass and made something of myself. But now all I ever hear is how I'm not happy and that everyone misses the dacotah that was happy. I think they really just miss the dacotah that they could pick on without repercussions. I'm not sure how to feel about it all, if I'm not expressing a feeling of loss I just feel numb.\n\n I have problems expressing myself, or so I'm told. My college roommates used to call me emotionally detached. My girlfriend at the time thought so too, eventually they all just pushed me out of their life. I spent the 2nd half of the year alone in my dorm. \n\nI've never had the heart to call somebody out on their shit or get mad at somebody. I just end up mad at myself and wishing for that brief moment of misery to be over. My girlfriend, god bless her, has been supportive through these last couple months but she doesn't fully get it, and I don't know if I could ever explain it all. I love her to death and I hate the look on her face when I'm upset, nobody should ever have to worry about me.\n\nIn the 5 or 6 years since my sister ran away I have done nothing but watch my father fall into a pit of alcoholism. He's pushed everyone away from him and his problems only get thrown or deflected on me. He blames me for all of his misery, the divorce, the money. Which of course only opens opportunities for me to get confronted further. He would bitch me out and threaten to kick my ass, he'd pass out and I'd pick him up.  He'll apologize the next morning say he didn't mean it and do it again the next week. He actually did this again recently, he apologized but I've never wanted to be further from him. I'm not sure if he even remembers what all he has said. I haven't had the heart to tell him all the disgusting things he's said to me but it's really killing me knowing how he really feels. \n\nI know how to play instruments and I don't consider myself an idiot, I'm sure I have some smarts. I was always a busy person, writing for blogs, testing supplements for muscle tech, playing shows or just general choir engagements. I work for a cleaner service currently and I'm miserable. I thought working with things instead of people would help me.

I live with my sister in a different state, because I used to get on with her. But now she has turned into a different person since I was hospitalised for depression and suicide attempts last year - I think it's because I am a reminder of the terrible and abusive childhood the children of my family experienced, and my sister is in denial about it effecting her. She is cruel and angry towards me. My whole family think I'm overreacting/lying because that is  what fits in with their denial.  \n  \nI was so desperate for some understanding that I booked flights back to my moms house for two weeks over the holidays. I'm one week in and my PTSD and anxiety have been getting progressively out of control since arriving. My family don't respect my personal space, they touch me unexpectedly which is a major fear for me and when I tell them I'd rather they didn't do that, they just laugh and keep going. Every time someone touches me I feel an overwhelming nausea and desire to cry or act violently towards them. Even my 4 year old niece, who I love and does not mean anything by her touches. I know they're trying to protect themselves by acting like my problems are not real, but I can't handle it. We all went through the abuse, why am I the only one facing it (and therefore suffering from it)?  \n \n  \nI have 6 days until my flight back home, and 1 day after that is my psychiatrist appointment, which I'm hanging out for. I feel like my greatest need is to be accepted into a different family, just for a year until I can get over the worst of this. My psychiatrist and my psychologist are my only friends and it sounds sad but that's how it is. I don't trust anyone else not to hurt me somehow.  \n   \nI don't know what to do. I'm so alone, and so overwhelmed. I'm trying not to be hurt by my family because they're just protecting themselves from reminders of the past. they will have to face the trauma at some point too. But I feel like I need to cut them off from my life completely for a few years until I'm stronger.  \n  \nI'm just so scared all the time here, so filled with dread and fear and anxiety. I want to have a family that loves me and listens. My own family is toxic, full of monsters and damaged people. I'm still just a little kid inside, and I'm not capable of doing this on my own. The trauma work with my psychiatrist is slow going because I'm so damaged, and react intensely to the slightest reminders. The nightmares have been constant this past week and I can't afford to change my flight home to sometime sooner.  \n  \nHow do I do this? How do you guys manage? I want a hug and someone to tell me it's all going to be ok. ",

I left my fiance in November of 2015, which is a long story but it boils down to I always felt like I was never enough in her eyes. I felt like she was emotionally abusive, so I left. For a time I seemed to be happy. I had just gotten out of the military (note this story has nothing to do with trauma from the military) and I moved back to my home town so I could finally see my friends and family regularly again. All seemed like it was going well. I got a job at the local hospital, I'm currently living with my sister so that's helping with money. I just feel like I'm a shell of the person I was before I met my Ex. I don't know how to be happy anymore and I don't even remember what it feels like to experience true elation for something. I use to love writing or reading, I can barely do both anymore. This is the most I've written, and meant it, in a long time. I took some of those online tests, just a minute ago, to tell me if it was possible that I was depressed. Everyone of them said, \"You are likely Severely Depressed\".

        "Origin_reddit": "The more I sit back and think. The more I realize that I'll never recover from the psychological damage both high school and college have caused me.\n\nPeople were just downright awful to me in high school. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused by shit heads that live in my neighborhood. It's like there mission was to make my life miserable. They ruined my life in every way. They posted humiliating pictures of me online. They beat me up whenever they feel like it. They called me horrible names. You name it they did it. \n\nMy senior year prom date was a complete bitch. She didn't talk to me for the entire night and abandoned me for her friends. Literally everything was perfect we talked every day, I asked her to prom. Then it all went downhill. She never acknowledged me presence in school. She was so rude to me on prom night. I regret following her around like I was some stupid sheep. Should have just left her. I recently snapped and got really mad at her when we didn't talk for awhile. I let her have it and I feel no remorse that I lashed out on her. She deserved it with the hell she put me through. She broke my heart and ruined my prom night. Something I'll never get back.\n\nI had no friends in high school. People would just ignore me. Never asked me for plans. They were all just fake ass people. They always talked to people that were better then me. I was always a second choice. Not even a fucking second choice. \n\nHigh school set the stages and fucking destroyed any positive view I have on people. I often stormed out of classes and broke down crying in the guidance office because of how I was treated. Nobody gave a shit. I was sent home one day after having a complete meltdown, throwing a tissue box at my counselor, crying, and getting so mad to the point I almost passed out. I literally hate people. All I have done was be friendly to them and they have to treat me like shit in return. People did some nasty things to me and I was suicidal. Now I come out of high school with an extremely hateful view on people my age. I wanted friends and I still want friends, but literally me getting friends is just super unlikely. So I just sit back and watch the others have fun while I rot.\n\nCollege? Heh, people told me college would be different. My parents made me go to my local community college and that decision fucked over any chance of me having a normal college social life. I'm mad at my parents to this day for not letting me go to a college I wanted to go to. Now I'll never get to experience the joys of living in a dorm and I don't have any friends for an apartment. I hate college. Nobody at my college talks to each other. It's antisocial and I'm often sitting alone or walking alone. Nobody talks to me. I even approach people in class, nobody talks to me.\n\nNow a little bit about myself. I'm extremely shy. Yes, I've gotten better at it but honestly, this doesn't make a difference because I even talked to people and they still wouldn't act like I'm there.\n\nI also am not much of a partier. I hate parties and I just hate being around drugs and alcohol. It just isn't my kind of fun and I always stay away from it.\n\nLiterally laying here in my bed crying which I have been for the last fucking week. I don't have a therapist appointment till Friday. My therapist is too busy to talk too. I honestly don't think I'll make it to Friday. I am becoming suicidal again and I just don't see a point in living through these awful college + high school years. Even if I make it, I'm so psychologically fucked up from high school and college that it will impact me in the future. I don't want to live anymore. I just want to be happy again and sadly I think ending it is the only way as I can't get anything going for me.",

Five years ago i started taking meds also for anxiety. I have an eating disorder for also nearly 16 years. I feel low and like if i was completely worthless.\nI have conquered many battles in my life, sexual abuse by relative and school peers, drug addiction and acute self harming. Ive had awful relationships where i guess i was trying to fill the emotional void my father left inside my soul. The father of my child was abusive and an alcoholic and a drug addict. He got over his issues and is really a changed man and we get along fine. I still feel bad for not making us work or succeed. Like many things in my life, it was a huge failure.

        "Origin_reddit": "This is going to long guys..sorry. I've been a long time lurker and I've never posted. I've read all of your posts, shared tears and smiles with things that I identify with. It makes me feel both sad and happy to know I'm not alone. I've been depressed since I could remember. I used to be a happy and positive little girl until the first time I was bullied. Since, I've been bullied and made to feel like shit from so many people in my life. My low self-esteem began maybe when I was 6? I've been struggling with life since. I'm 25 and I haven't finished my degree. Why? Because I can't make myself do the work. I get motivated for the first month and say this year will be different and I fucking fall into depression again and I can't get out. I fear falling behind and when I do I fucking give up. I will get my degree this spring (finally). I've had to get academic withdrawals because of my depression. I feel like a failure while all the people I know are flourishing. My life needs to change.\n\nI told my mom today that I want to make an appointment with a psychiatrist so I can get meds. I've depressed my entire life...and I've tried to deal with it but my life is shit and I know something needs to change. I called and made an appointment and I'm fucking scared. I don't want to talk to someone who will be internally judging my fucked up decisions and life. \n\nThen my mom has been acting bummed and I asked why. She said she doesn't understand. Her and my dad have given me all they could and it doesn't make sense why I'm sad. She's now sad and blaming herself. I've tried to tell them it's not their fault and they don't get it. I can't talk to them. \n\nI can't talk to my boyfriend. We've been together for seven years. We met in college and I was better with my depression and actually socialized. But the years carried on and he graduated and we've been long distance since. I lost my friends because they betrayed me or just found me so boring. My best friend stopped talking to me when I got a senator internship over her congressman one. She just stared at me when I told her and neither she or her family congratulated me. She stopped talking to me since then. That was three years ago. She was my last friend. Sine then, I don't hang out with anyone, except my boyfriend when he visits. We've been long distance for the last five years but after my best friend left me, I've been so alone. \n\nMy boyfriend is the opposite of me. In college and after, he's that guy everyone loves. He can make friends with a freaking tree. He attracts people and he has many friends and is social. I'm the complete opposite. He has to beg to get me to come out with him and his friends, and if I do i always have to drink. It's the only way I can talk and not just sit their silent. He's seen me when I'm so depressed that I can't even get out of bed. The last year has been horrible for me. I've spent weeks just in bed... and I can tell he's getting tired of it. \n\nHe keeps saying I bring up the past and the pain I've endured and I can't let things go. I want to I just don't know how. I don't trust people and I don't know how to carry on conversations anymore. I feel resentful he's so social and well liked. When I'm alone watching TV like any other fucking day, he's out and having fun. I want to but I can't. \n\nFor New Years Eve, I saw he was with people (mostly girls) and I texted him saying \"are you spending new years with girls??\" He just said. \"not one, there are some here but I'm not with them.\" I told him to \"well have fun.\" He didn't call to say HNY or hasn't talked to me since. \n\nThe past four days I had another depressive \"bender.\" I just cried, slept, and stared at my ceiling. I couldn't even watch tv. I just go some motivation to do some shit. \n\nI'm hoping seeing the psychiatrist will help and I can get ADD and Anti-Depressants. Shit needs to change. \n\nI've just been writing down my thoughts. Sorrry this is so long. This is just 10% of what I wish I could say but I don't want to write a freaking 100 page essay.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "Origin_reddit": "I was starting to feel low and burn out before New Years, and the evening allowed me to rise above my subjective perspective of myself and my interactions with people. I usually try not to party too hard *nudge nudge*, but it was a net positive I think. I reevaluated how I was doing and got a more complete view of psychological state.\n\nI was also really happy to feel comfortable and actually see (as opposed to view a person through my preconceived notion) people a little more than I usually am able to.\n\nGender and Sexuality\n===============\nI grew up in a conservative environment, but I actually never felt ashamed of my gender or ashamed of my sexuality. I would get boy and girl crushes all the time and think nothing of it other than, ' oh this person is so cool and I really want to get to know them'. I was more effeminate and got bullied for it, including authority figures turning a blind eye or encouraging it. Pretty lame times that reinforced that people can be savage.\n\nIn expression and identity, I guess I was pretty androgynous growing. I never felt like I was a woman or that I wanted to be a manly man. I thought the gender binary people expressed themselves in was narrow and boring, so I kind of made a point to disregard it. \n\nUnfortunately, I have also learned that some people will not let you survive or function without expressing yourself in a way that they seem fit. I've experienced way too many people being openly hostile because of my mere existence. Today, I have to role-play as a bro just to survive in many professional environments. It feels degrading to my soul, but the trade off is I have some money. Its a bit emotionally exhausting and doesn't feel nice.\n\nAll in all, I am bi and not too happy with the prejudices people have in the world.\n\n\nSocialization\n==============\nI am used to compartmentalizing my feelings. I have lost a great deal of friends who had either fallen off the face of the earth, OD'd, killed themselves, or had been too much grief to keep in contact with. I am craving close relationships and self-growth, but I am finding it difficult to meaningfully connect with people. I wonder if the feeling of abandoning other people because it is easier than being abandoned comes into play for me right now. I've felt that way in the past, but I thought I got over it. \n\nI am going to school and have had gainful employment, but it doesn't help me connect in the ways I seek. I socialize and feel like I am role-playing. Many friendships with people seem superficial and unfulfilling, and these are typically with normalish people. I don't have a problem putting myself 'out there' if I'm not down and out in a low period. I am social and have been told I am easy going and funny just as often as I've been told I can come across as a bitch without intending to or even saying anything (hah).\n\nDespite what other people seem to think, I usually feel on-guard and can hardly be intimate / open up to folks. I think my memory is eroding due to long-term stress. What good is living life and collecting lessons from experiences if you can't remember them? What good is gaining perspective if you just lose it in a time of need? \n\nI'm uneasy not knowing people's motivations. I try to learn about people and what they want from me in an attempt to predict what may happen. \n\n\nRelationships\n===============\nI don't feel like I need to be in a relationship, but I do know that I need meaningful relationships. Although, it would be nice to find someone romantically that sees me for who I am and empowers me. Obviously, I have my doubts that I'll let anyone close enough to get the chance though.\n\nCurrent partner was raised by a narcissist and is emotionally unavailable in a similar way as me. It is a comfortable yet emotionally unfulfilling relationship. I guess we're together out of a mutual need for physical intimacy and care? We care for each other, and she's incredibly gifted and into really cool stuff. We both value our space apart too due to similar issues.\n\n\nThe abridged version of my life:\n================\nAs a child, I was very depressed due to life circumstances out of my control. Many of the relatives that I was close to straight up died, moved away, or quit speaking to me due to my parents' issues.\n\nMy parents made very unwise mistakes, fought often, and were not emotionally empowering. Purposefully went out of my way to not pick up their habits. Kind of felt a low-level mistrust of people since childhood due to bullying from other kids and abuse from authority figures. I liked books way more than people and read a lot. Most of my role-models were dead white guys haha.\n\nHigh school was better, smoked weed and did somewhat engaging things with friends. Urban exploring, clubbing, extracurriculars, art, etc.\n\nIn spite of my world sucking, I was pretty motivated to leave and made decent grades. I qualified for a bunch of academic scholarships and went overseas. Found out the home was being foreclosed and the cars repossessed about midway through my year abroad. Traveled as much as I could and tried to not think too hard about returning to a state of no opportunities. Kinda spiraled into depression after realizing how good I was living abroad and how I would likely not see my new friends again.\n\nAt 16 I was thrust out into the world alone, ended up with little to no social supports or family due to my sexuality. It was also easier for my parents since they were struggling to get back on their own feet. Went around with a traveler friend I had made, riding trains and getting into trouble. Watched my travel buddy die of a heroin OD. Wound up in an abusive relationship on the coast. Pimped by someone older than me that I had been dating, experienced extreme stress and trauma due to some pretty bad influences in my life and feeling like there was no way out.\n\nEventually distanced myself from most of these horrible people, but I went through a period of agoraphobia where I wouldn't leave my apartment even if I ran out of food. Routinely disassociated and felt unable to connect to people.\n\nWent on anti-psychotics for treatment resistant depression, basically strung out of my mind on benzos most of the day. Ditched the psych-meds and started meditating, doing shrooms, gradually meeting people. Got somewhat better, but I lost memories and cognitive functioning as a side effect of the anti-psychotics and benzos. Eventually returned to baseline (I think). Enrolled at a nearby school.\n\nStarted dating a guy who was diagnosed with NPD and in the marine corps. At first, his confidence and arrogance was endearing, and he was on frequent deployments which meant that we really valued the time we had together. Felt like I had a home for the first time in my life and actually loved. He was emotionally withdrawn, and I was also emotionally messed up to an extent. It worked out well enough. Was making a decent amount of money doing online stock trading and investing as well as taking classes online.\n\nWe would talk about our perspectives of the world. Goals. Ways to achieve our dreams. I designed our apartment and basically took care of his cats. Although I paid half the rent, I was kind of like expected to be a live-in nanny which wasn't too weird considering the shit I had gone through in life so far. He was a dom and we were both poly, so he would date basically my female-equivalent clones and we'd have threesomes (I would usually have shortish platinum blond haircuts and so would they). FWIW the sex with him pretty great even though he was kind of a sociopath.\n\nAfter his contract with the military ended and he felt somewhat aimless, he began to cycle through emotions quickly and decided I wasn't worth his time. Literally a week after professing an extreme amount of love for me that he never felt before. He once described loving people like he would love eating a candy bar. That I had never done anything good for him. Really felt mind fucked - this wasn't a naive first relationship sorta deal. I even went with him to meet his parents once. It seriously felt like a deep relationship up until that point. \n\nMoved with friends to the bay, so did he. After a 6 month period of lackluster dating, we began an on and off again fuck-buddy relationship with that same guy. We agreed it would be purely physical, but he was trying to cross my boundaries. Eventually, I asked him to stay out of my life entirely. He told he had raped me after I passed out from GHB one evening bwfore either of us moved to the bay. I remember the incident vaguely, but I never opened my eyes and so just left it up to being something I imagined. Really screwed with me.\n\nBest friend at the time was dating my partner, they ended up doing meth and being dicks. I cut them out of my life after they stoles from me. Not so funnily enough, my current best friend is being weird with my current partner - has been rejected by her and feels dissatisfied in his dating life. I feel like there is resentment being directed at me  and things are compounding on top of it. Too emotionally stressed to deal with it, so I am giving him space for awhile.\n\nHad a crazy housemate situation where a couple made living at my space unbearable for me and 3 other housemates. We were all on the lease and couldn't evict them. I was stressed 100% of the time and never knew what they would do next. Can't really relax there even though they've been gone.\n\nI am ashamed of what I have been through, but I try not to blame myself entirely for my life circumstances. A life without self-expression and enjoyment isn't a life worth living. I am sick of only surviving. I know something is wrong, but I don't have the tools to identify and fix it.\n\nI've seen 6 different therapists - all ended up being useless, clueless, or offensive. Struggling to find a quality low income psych or therapists, but I am asking around.\n\n\n*My living situation is tenuous and there is no long-term guarantee of housing. I also live in an extremely expensive area, and I don't have any social supports outside of here. Kind of feel trapped by this. \n\n\nCurrent thoughts\n==============\nI don't want to live a fear based lifestyle. \n\nI'd like to think that with all of my life experiences and trauma, I am not a complete basket case. I think I work much harder than most people to hold myself together. My worst fear is that I will become an emotionally reactive monster and permanently lose sight of the humanity of others. That my ability to rationalize and integrate my experiences will be lost forever. That I will be a scared, closed off, zombie for the rest of my life. It's really unnerving.\n\nI've made so much progress over the last 5ish years to reach a point of relative stability, but it doesn't seem to be enough. I can't continue to expend so much energy on getting by. It's chipping at my will to live. With that being said, I'm not planning to make rash decisions. \n\n\nSome problems I have\n==============\n*Moody\n\n*Typically pretty tense\n\n*Tend to feel a level of stress at all times\n\n*burn out after period of high stress leading to being withdrawn / unmotivated\n\n*Have to fake being relaxed to interact with people in high stress periods (lots of projects, midterms/finals, relationship stuff)\n\n*Memory is worsening\n\n*Sometimes memories are hard to put in chronological order, not impossible - but it takes actual effort to piece together\n\n*Sleep not restful\n\n*Expect the worse from people, but I try to give them opportunities to prove me wrong \n\n*Sometimes impulsive when depressed, but I work pretty hard to control this - used to be caught up by by life's wayward distractions instead of introspecting \n\n*Sometimes experience anhedonia\n\n*ADHD may be related\n\n*Funnily enough, I don't feel safe being emotional around people sometimes",

Her parents told her she couldn't come back unless she got divorced and so she did. Then a friend of hers tells her they know someone who has a house that is empty and has power. So she decides to go squat there. Well apparently the guy who was staying there was in jail. he gets out and they start living together. They have sex and she gets pregnant with me. Around the same time she's seeing the type of person he really is. She's pregnant and he wants to get pitbulls and he is training them to be fighting dogs. He takes her cat and feeds it to the dogs to rile them up. He beats her a lot. He kills her pets. One day the dog poop on the floor and he beats her with the shower rod and makes her eat the dog poop. Luckily she doesn't loose me as she is about 7 months pregnant. One of his friends comes over and helps her leave and my father accuses her of cheating. She wasn't cheating, even though Casey was in love with her and thats why he helped her. Im about 10 months old and she steals a dog from a man who was abusing it. She goes to jail for like 2 days. When she gets home, my father hadn't even as so much as changed my diaper. He was passed out drunk. Fast forward to when I am 3. She finally leaves him after he points a crossbow at me. After that she gets married and my step dad is strict but im also spoiled. We had money and a farm and my mum is the perfect mum and houseswife. When I am 10 she has an affair with the neighbor and gets pregnant. Tells her husband and he says she needs to get an abortion or he is leaving. so she gets an abortion and he leaves anyway. They get divorced and she gives up the house and everything we have. The farm and all the animals and our pets and we move up north. Im home alone almost every night so i eat dinner at the neighbors and she's always either working or at the bar. dating several different men and never home. She meets a guy and I didnt like him from the start. he used to steal money from her. He actually had a girlfriend he lived with and was having a baby with and she didnt seem to care. while he was having sex with multiple women. he gave me the creeps though and when i told my mum she said i was being a brat because i was mad about the divorce. when i am 12 they have 2 kids together and we have no power in our house in the middle of winter. my brothers are a year old and a newborn at this time. I cannot shower because the water is too cold in the house. So I take showers at school trying to hurry before anyone gets there. the school counselor keeps giving me clothes and its embarrassing. I run away from home and get caught immediately. Get the shit beat out of me. My mum accuses me of having sex with someone i was friends with. at this point ive never even kissed a boy. she's calling me a slut and throws me into the doorway and i cut my nose on a loose nail she says i hurt myself on purpose. Then we end up moving again because she says im going to get her arrested. im 13 and i am getting bad grades at my new school. she beats me with a studded belt all over my body and shaves all my hair off. I tell the school counselor and they do nothing about it. That summer i find out i failed 7th grade. and the beats me with the handle side of a fly swatter. the next day she screams at me that someone is coming over and \"why the f*ck are you wearing short sleeves?\" And i get beat again. I run away that night. I get a ride from a random guy and ask him to take me to the sheriffs dept. he lets me stay the night since it is so late and the next day he takes me. I tell them and I go into foster care. My mum tells them i am lying and that I am mad because I can't go out and have sex. Which is absurd. I end up with a foster family, they are religious. They do not like my alternative/dark style and so after 3 months I am sent to a new home.  The new foster family is an old couple. they have 2 other teenage girls who are 4 years older than me. The one they considered a daughter and she had been living with them since she was like 6. She hated me. I dunno why. But she was always so mean to me and treated me like crap. Well the old lady didn't seem to like me either. So the girl I shared a room with was the only one I had to talk to. One day a cupcake is missing from the kitchen and I get blamed for it. But I did not eat it. I get screamed at and then I go to school. After school my social worker picks me up and says that Im going to a new home. Im at the new home with the same girl who i shared a room with. She's a bit of a sl*t and is always getting me in trouble. And my depression gets really bad. I start cutting myself. When I go to school one of my friends see's my arm and tells the teacher. I'm sent to a mental health facility and am there for a year and a half. one day my social worker says If I do not go back to my parents I have to stay at the facility until I am 18. So I go back to them. A few months pass and after my final meeting with my counselor my parents decide we are moving. when we move, they do not put me back in school. They tell me I am going to be homeschooled. So I now am officially not allowed to leave the house at all. a few months pass and we are homeless. so my mums husband buys a crappy camper and we live in an rv park. i have to sleep in a tent tho. during hurricane season. the tent doesnt do good for keeping me dry at night. so i just get used to it. This goes on for 10 months and one day my step dad tries to rape me. when i tell my mum she says its my fault because i am a sl*t. We move into a house. I try to run away again but i cant. a month passes and they are drunk. they come into my room and he takes my clothes off and she holds me down. then i start crying. they stop and go to bed. the next morning she says if i ever tell anyone she will kill me. When I am 17, she leaves him and says she will make things right with me. but then goes back to him 2 months later. When i am 18 I meet a guy and he helps me run away. I'm with him and he is obsessive and he takes my phone away and accuses me of cheating. I'm with him 24/7. the last straw was when he hit me. so i meet another guy on CL and leave. I fall in love with him and right before Christmas he leaves me. I go back to my mums because i have nowhere to go now and she tries to take my phone of which i pay for. She won't let me leave the house and makes me cancel dates. I have to run away again. I backpack for a few months and end up in the west. Then I meet a guy on Facebook who I share mutual friends with. We hit it off and I move back to the south and we have been together since. ",
