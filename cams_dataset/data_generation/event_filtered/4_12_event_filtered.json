We're a small family, me an only child, and I am very lucky to have a close relationship with my parents, my mom especially. She has always been the type to 'mom' me and she was an emotional support that I never truly appreciated.\n\nHer death was sudden and unexpected because, as she did, she hid her own issues from me to lessen my burden. I still remember getting the call out of nowhere and my world crashing around me. While I am blessed with an amazing extended family, it's just Dad and me to carry on and he doesn't really get it. His go-to is dark humour which I frankly can't handle and I don't know if I ever will. He is also much more prepared for this, having known my mom was struggling as she was. He also doesn't understand mental illness, specifically depression, except to say that I should try being happier.\n\nWhich leads to the other side of this wombo-combo. I'm in a new city for school and the fall before my mom died, my only circle of friends (who also happen to be my co-workers) cast me out in a spectacular gaslighting endeavor that destroyed any self-confidence I had. I was told things I felt going on around me were all in my head, that I was imagining tension that wasn't there, and I should just chill.\n\nFast-forward to 2 days before my mom died and I get a request to meet from one of the more vocal of the group. I was on the phone with my mom, the last phone call I would ever have with her, and told her I had to go meet with this person. In that meeting, I'm told that everything I thought was going on, was actually going on (contrary to the months of gaslighting prior) and that I'm essentially a terrible person who deserved it. But, this person was willing to show me mercy and permit me to re-join this circle on the condition that I change everything about my personality.\n\nI was so lonely, so isolated, that I consented. I began to believe the lies about how horrible I was and within 24 hours, I was on the floor of my apartment, crying and trying to determine the best way to end my life because I saw no reason for a worthless, horrible person like myself to exist. I had decided to go get a knife when the phone rang with an unexpected call from a friend back home which broke through my thoughts long enough to break the cycle in my head.\n\nI wrote to our collective supervisor about the situation and went to lay down as I was having intense chest pain. The next day, I woke up and my mother had died of heart failure/heart attack (we didn't have an autopsy done).\n\nSo here I am, back in my isolation. My supervisor has ignored my repeated attempts to bring this issue to light as the situation has not improved at work at all in the last year. I've hidden myself away in my apartment, and I feel like I'm dying inside.\n\nI have so much guilt over cutting my phone call short with my mom to deal with this insane mind game. I have anger over these people stealing my energy from what's important. I still feel worthless for being unable to get past this. I just feel so much pain. I wish with all my being my mom was still here and I feel like I'm disappointing her by being unable to get my life back on track. I feel as though I'm drowning on the inside and no matter who I tell or what I say, all I hear is that 'you can do this' or 'just stay positive'. I am positive, and I can be positive, but that doesn't help when my depression sets in and my heart is breaking.

Just a little back story of myself: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve have depression and anxiety for 10 years after the loss of a parent at 14 but never sought immediate treatment. Last year was when I was official diagnosed. But anyways, 2017 was a really rough year for my anxiety and depression, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure others can probably empathize, and I kept experiencing one issue after another and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just completely drained me at this point.

However when they both told me about this very exciting news that I know meant a lot to them, Instantly triggered me. I felt scared and very sad which makes me look like a piece of shit I know because it sounds selfish. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the truth.

And I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have many friends and this made me panic and sad even more. Initially when they both told me their news on separate occasions I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t display the amount of excitement that I could because I felt numb. They both were aware prior to these events that my depression was getting bad to the point of isolation and lack of communication. I need help!

I've explained this and at first people claim to understand and will stick with me but in the end they just ignore me or some stupid argument causes a rift! I'm sick of it! I didn't cause depression and physical health to happen to me. Why can't people understand!?!?!?!?!",

And there are many reasons why but I don't think that we are the reason. \n\nJordan Peterson talked in one of his lectutes about a 2 year critical time  right around the age of 1 and 2 where we need human interaction the most. Thats where we learn the most social standarts. What I think is that since we stopped living in villigas and small communities we lack heavily in human interactions. There are places like kindergarden but they are too late. In germany there is a kita wich is for even younger children. The main thought for these is that the parents can go to work. That the wrong goal. These should be for social interaction teaching children how to get along. And how to deal with their own emotions by putting them in diffenet situations in fun games. \n\nAlso children and teenager should be forced to get human interaction. I mean if you k ow how to meet new people and how to communicate with them because you are too anxious (as me) to do the first step then it will be extreamly difficult to get better in this on your own!\n\nAlso I think our world looks just dirty and filthy. That is no enviourment to be happy around and when you live in a place like me (germany) where it rains almost all day you are fucked if you are allready depressed. \n\nWhat I also think thaz we are missing is that we need proper educations in basic hygene and how important it is. I see too many small children running arou d with really bad breath. Or they just smell aweful in general. If they won't build a bsaic hygene routine now it will be extreamly difficult in the future. \n\nAnd finally we lack on proper thinking. As carlsagan said \"science is a way of thinking\" But we never get educated in this. They all expect us to know how to think scientificly. We should just have one  class where they give us problems sometimes basic and sometimes hard but they should never be such problem wich yoz can learn. Everyproblem need to be diffrent and should all be solvable by thinking scientificly. \n\nI think if all people had this basic skill sets allot of people would be less depressed and more motivated to do thinks because you would know how to solve problems wven if they were totally new and with unknow parameters for you.\n\nSorry for the long text but Idk where to post this else where then here since this is one way to prevent most of the depressions (like mine).\n\nIf I got that when I was younger then I would be whole diffrent person.
