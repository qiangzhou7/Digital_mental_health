The following is my stack and some background information.*\n\n\n\nI saw an Adult ADHD Specialist last month and he said while I've been treated primarily for *ADHD-PI* (diagnosed by Psychologist and follow ups with Psychiatrists) it is NOT the root cause of my *depression* and *anxiety.* My ADHD-PI and Anxiety are result from my depression ...mind blown ...I've been running the wrong way for 10yrs now?!\n\n\n\nDisappointed as I really wasn't expecting this; I wrestled with it for a bit but then finally accepted it and am moving fwd. My doctor read the report and added 25mg of Aventyl to my bedtime stack. A couple weeks later my family was worried as I was severely depressed and upset for many reasons. I saw another doctor and he doubled the 25mg of Aventyl to 50mg and introduced Siv-Escitalopram (10mg) to be taken in my morning stack. \n\n    \n\nI'm a little worried as he and the pharmacists warned me about **[Serotonin Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome)**. I also have been told/read that if you mess with your brain chemistry too much it could wake up a dormant bipolar disorder in you, that is if bipolar disorder is in your family history - and it is.\n\n    \n\nI don't drink often (1-2 drinks a week), eat 3 balanced meals (eggs and asparagus, bulletproof coffee, protein and veggies, aim for low sugar), and jog every other day.\n\n    \n\nHere is my present day stack I need advice on please:\n\n    \n\nAM (w/food): \n\n* Siv-Escitalopram (10mg)\n\n* Vyvanse (50mg)\n\n* Wellbutrin (300mg)\n\n* Vitamin D (3000IU)\n\n* Omega 3 (EPA600mg/DHA240mg)\n\n* Coenzyme Q10 (100mg)\n\n* Iodine (0.045ml)\n\n    \n\nLunch: \n\n* OptiMen Multivitamin (1)\n\n    \n\nDinner: \n\n* OptiMen Multivitamin (1)\n\n    \n\n\nBefore Bed: \n\n* Aventyl (50mg)\n\n* Lorazepam (0.5mg)\n\n* Melatonin (1.25 mg)\n\n* Magnesium (200mg)\n\n* GABA (750mg)\n\n* Apple Cider Vinegar + Honey",

Most of us do it through the wrong ways that will have it fluctuating up and down causing an imbalance within ourselves.\nWe can do this from manipulating others of their energy, using substances, watching TV, using our cellphones, spending money, and the list goes on.\n\nIt does not have to be this way though and is not the best route. We can constantly have the love emotion in us and can do it in a beautiful way with ourselves without it fluctuating.\n\nHow can we hold the love emotion naturally?\n\nWe can receive and hold this beautiful emotion in us through the beauty of the natural world.\nThrough nature, the environment, animals, real food, ourselves, and even people if we do it the correct way. The energy is abundant and unlimited so it is not needed to manipulate others for it or do it in the non-beneficial ways.\n\nAllow yourself to embrace the beauty of the natural world and have the love fill yourself completely.\n\nLet go of your ego as it will just try to survive and destroy love.\nWhere love lives, ego cannot survive. It's only goal is to bring you down through selfish means and scare you into thinking love is not the answer.\n\nLove is truly magical when you allow it to completely engulf yourself.\n\nWhen you apply it correctly you can have all the benefits mentioned above.

        "Origin_reddit": "So I posted this on facebook to share with the handful of friends I know that are also suffering from mental illness. Unfortunately it was met with a wave of \"GET HELP\" messages that were not warranted or asked for. \n\nSo I'm going to share it here with you folks and hope that it helps at least one person.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nI want to share something with all of my friends that are suffering from depression, anxiety or other mental illness. It's something I've been trying to do since I moved and I'm making it my official new years resolution. I won't promise it will work for you. We're all different, but it has helped me.\n\nEvery day pick one productive thing to get done. Just ONE. Even if it's something insignificant. Especially on the days you just want to stay in bed and wish for death and you can't find any motivation to do anything else.\n\nEven something as simple as washing your hair. Wash that one pan you've been letting 'soak' in the sink for the last three days. Do one load of laundry and actually fold it and put it away. Sweep your kitchen floor. Vacuum your living room. Wipe your kitchen counters. Just one thing, even if it only takes 5 minutes.\n\nSometimes you may even find that overcoming that initial inertia gives you enough energy and motivation to do more. Maybe you clean the whole kitchen instead of just doing that one dish. But don't worry if it doesn't. As long as you do the one thing.\n\nJust doing one productive thing each day can make you hate yourself a little less and feel a little less worthless.  And maybe when you come home from work and walk into a slightly cleaner kitchen you'll have a little feeling of satisfaction that is often elusive to those of us suffering with mental illness.\n\nIt's not a cure or anything. It might not even work for you. I don't know. I just wanted to share something that has helped me a little. Maybe it can help you too.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nThat's what I posted on facebook but I want to lay down some rules for this exercise. \n\n1. **Don't** make a 'to do' list. Writing down everything you need / want to get done and having a big list to look at can be incredibly overwhelming and may cause you to recede further into your illness and retreat. We don't want that. Pick the one thing you want to get done either the night before or that morning and just do it. \n\n2. Your basic responsibilities such as going to work and feeding your children / pets does not count. Most of us have already learned to go through the motions of doing these things without reaching out of our comfort zone. Pick something you would normally procrastinate on or not do at all. \n\n3. Do it every day no matter what. No matter how shitty you feel or how badly you want to stay in bed. Staying in bed and doing nothing only feeds into our sense of worthlessness and self hatred. Get your ass up and at least do the one thing, even if you go right back to bed afterwards. If you are having an extraordinarily bad day pick the easiest thing you can possibly think of to get done and do it. Even if it only takes 30 seconds.\n\n4. Allow yourself forgiveness if you don't complete your task to the extent that you originally wanted to. Beating yourself up is counter productive to the point of the exercise. Quoted from one of our members that suggested this rule.\n&gt;I've been doing this and it does help. I am also more forgiving of myself. If I did have something I wanted to do, but didn't get it done I tell myself: it's okay, at least you got x,y,z done, and next time you should try to do x,y,z better. Really really really helps. \n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nPlease feel free to share / discuss any other rules for this exercise that should be added.\n\nAnd of course PLEASE share with us how / if it's working for you. Tell us the things you accomplished today and in the future. \n\nFor me today I cleaned my critter cages and took one of them that is no longer in use out to my garage and vacuumed the room I keep them in.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nTL:DR (though I urge you to read at least the basic rules of the exercise) Do one productive thing a day no matter what. It might help you feel a little less worthless and demotivated. ",

I had asked them to play, and they replied back with ''no hi or hello?''. It's just another one of the things I forget. Basic social rules like saying hi. Maybe it's the case that I've always been a cold and clumsy person, but I was forgiven for it when younger because of still being outgoing and trying to be positive around others. Now I can barely tell what I do wrong anymore, it just seems to be everything in so many parts of life. I'm an idiot. I've tried to be more caring but still feel so disconnected and unappreciated by others. It's not like being appreciated is what I'm entitled to. It's the contrary, and on the bright side maybe that could have its benefits too. You won't get any unwanted attention if you don't want to, you can just keep to yourself and people will respect that.\n\nWhat makes me feel worse is that despite trying to connect others, I can't seem to. There's always that doubting and fear that I'm doing something wrong. Accidentally offending someone, not asking interesting enough questions, sounding lazy. Even if I change to seem more positive or confident (though no one has even pointed out that I seem negative!) it doesn't seem to make any difference. People react weirdly to me anyways. I feel like I can't even have small talk without it being noticed how awkward I am, how no one really gives a fuck, how my mind is blank and I have nothing fun to talk about. I feel like I've been contaminated and can't do anything right despite my best efforts. Almost never share negative feelings  with people either, so that's not the issue despite what this pity post might let someone think. \n\nAre some people just fundamentally unlikeable?

I can think of times when I have been extremely happily (mainly middle school), and very functional despite having mild depression, such as in highschool (prior state ranked athlete), but I was wondering if people with major depression (such as myself) or bipolar disorder, or even other mental illnesses are living in a constant genetic predisposition to depression, in which (when they're off medication), their mind/thoughts/senses are always in a strings length of a depressive episode.\n\nFor instance, picture an Instagram filter than is dark and bleak. I have always been a dark/unlively person and I learned to find bliss and stress reduction in my seemingly cloudy lifestyle/outlook. My \"happy\" emotions are mainly nostalgia and excitement. Like i said, i have been happy at certain points in my life, but i still always have that \"filter\"...
