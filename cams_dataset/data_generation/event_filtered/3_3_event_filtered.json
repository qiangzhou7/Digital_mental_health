TLDR: sick of the grind of depression, no support system, just need to get it out.\n\nBasically, I have no will to live.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been like this one other time in my life-when I was 15 and hospitalized for 4 weeks. During that time, however, I did want to die. I feel like I want to crawl out of my skin from anxiety but at the same time,  I have zero energy or motivation to get out of bed. Recently I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had some serious financial problems, but nothing else has changed. I have an amazing job that people dream of and thousands of people would take in a second.I live in a beautiful area of the country, and I have food to eat and a roof over my head.

Definitely not looking forward to the usual 6 week haze that follows. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also in the medical field, and sadly there is a pretty big stigma associated with mental health. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not respected and no one talks about it. Patients with it are taken less seriously.  I feel very alone. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m  estranged from my family for many years and moved across the country 3 years ago and have a very small circle (like 3 people.)\n\nI guess I just needed to get it out.

(Not the good kinda stoned) I mean where it was just too much. \n\n    So my buddies came over to my house yesterday. I'm usually not depressed but just a little lost sometimes. Just every once in awhile I'll get depression that will last from a day to a week usually. And one of them brought some really potent weed. And we were gonna do it both days of new year ( New Year's Day New Year's Eve.) \n\n    So last night was New Year's Eve. And we were smoking it. One of them didn't,  it was just two of us and we were out in my old broken pickup truck freezing and smoking weed with a lighter with almost no fluid but it worked. A bottle and a 3/4in socket pressed into a water ballon filler as the bowl. It looked stupid but it worked. And we honestly had a fun time laughing about how stupid it seemed how other were inside and we're sitting in an old pickup truck smoking weed out a bottle. That night was fun, just sitting around chilling.\n\n    So the next day was not as fun. We were smoking some now in the morning. We smoked like 2 full bowls with low tolerance. And we were so stoned we were freaking out. It was not fun and felt very depressing and lost. The buddy that brought it had a little more than me and he got sick from it. I didn't but it certainly felt like it. While I was sitting in the other living room coming down. It suddenly struck me that I'm a nobody. That all these things that I do are not what I want to do.\n\n    It's about school is what my realization was about. It's a pretty small school so that's nice. But that's not what it's about. It's because I always talk about how I want to drop out and all about what shitty jobs I'll have to work. And I think if I drop out then I can just sit at home and play video games and live in those games in my head. But I realized sitting there that I was wrong this whole time. It's laziness that making me not do work and not give a fuck about school. I suddenly felt that I didn't want to drop out, how I wanted to do the school work. To not be shamed for what my opinion is about it. I feel that I have just already thrown my life away. I have all Fs in classes. And I feel I just need to do better because I haven't been trying one bit all school year so far. I feel I need to change it all then I think I would be happier. \n\n    I'm probably not making sense at this point my mind is still somewhat foggy cause I was like tripping for awhile from the weed. Btw I don't smoke that much just every once in awhile.\n\n    But now I'm asking for your advice on what I should do and tips to do it. I feel like I can't but I know I have to try.\n\n    I think if I finish school and graduate. I could do what I want then. Have a place to call home. Work a job and then when not working just have fun then like video games as an example I suppose. Just thinking about how I could have my own home and to love myself and not be ashamed that I'm throwing my life away.\n\n    I wouldn't have to be throwing my life away if I don't throw it away.

The amount of antibiotics and painkillers I used only makes all the symptoms I have much worse. Sometimes I feel like I am the most unfortunate person in this world.

I can't find anything when I google it. \n\nI am a 21 year old male from the uk and have recently graduated and got a job out of uni. I'm from a comfortable family and my parents are still together and have been great all my life. I have a good group of friends who I see regularly, but all my life I've had a sort of apathy for living.\n\n I'm not sad and I'm even happy most of the time but I can't help feeling that life is fairly meaningless and it has always been really difficult for me to do anything. I don't really enjoy anything other than smoking weed and doing downers, such as Xanax, codeine and Valium. I'm addicted to weed and really struggle not to do harder drugs everyday too, but despite this I manage to hold my life together, even though I am high most of the time. For me, everything in life takes the same amount effort, from working to going out or seeing my friends, and so far I have managed to keep everything together by promising myself to do 2 constructive things a day although this has become really draining recently and I'd prefer to just lie in bed all day. \n\nDespite not really caring about anything I also get really irrational fits of anger and always ending up breaking stuff or ruining friendships and I don't know why. Last night I broke up with my girlfriend who knew about my weed use but not much else, although she knew I did other stuff. \n\nShe was the thing I cared most about in life and she honestly made me care about life for a year, but for the last 6 months I've been slowly going back to not caring. I was just irrationally angry and I broke up with her for no reason and even while I was doing it I couldn't stop myself and I've fucked up the best thing in my life. I really struggle communicating my feelings with her and so I just blow up and blow things out of proportion. \n\nWithout her I don't care about anything and I just can't be bothered to go on living everyday feeling dead inside and occasionally very angry. But I can't be with herb because I screw it up every time. \n\nI don't want to die because my parents would be devastated and I care about them and my sister. But I do want to be dead because I can't be bothered to do life anymore, so I was wondering whether anyone else feels like this and if you have any tips as to how to keep going with it all?\n\nThanks for any responses.

Xanax and similar drugs just slowed my thoughts but didn't give me the courage or confidence to engage. Antidepressants never helped enough to notice. \n\nThe only thing that ever USED to help, and still does time to time was alcohol. I felt I could speak clearly and engage with all types of people. I had confidence and just loved life. But obviously I can't drink every day nor do I like drinking really.\n\nDepression has always been on and off for me. When I don't have a lot going on I get depressed. I was also pescribed an anti depressant for my migraines from the age of 15-18. I didn't know it was an antidepressant and when I forgot to take it on a trip, I had a complete emotional break down. Safe to say I STOPPED taking it. Now my depression comes and gos.\n\nI also have a stupid past of abusing \"rave drugs.\"  I have abused MDMA/molly a few times in the last 2 years. I really was uneducated at the time this could be very bad for someone with my issues and I feel like this past made my depression much worse/an actual problem. Trust me, not doing these things again. (I was very sheltered as a child so moving out was a huge learning experience)\n\nI currently am living a healthy lifestyle. I eat pretty good and workout almost everyday but I just have been feeling HORRIBLE lately..\n\nExtremely depressed. Nothing I used to do for fun is fun anymore. I feel this weight on my chest almost all day/everyday. I feel like all my social interactions are forced. I don't genuinely care what anyone is saying nor care to respond. And when I do to \"seem normal\" nothing comes out right or I just seem so fake.\n\nMy anxiety has been very bad. I have very negative thoughts, constantly think about my finance leaving me or people I love dying. Thinking I'm so disgusting. Literally no confidence at all. Going \"blank\" in social situations. Just not feeling human very dissociative. I run my own business and have panic attacks all the time (usually business related things cause this) or arguing.\n\nThis unmangiable feeling has been going on for a month now. Alcohol doesn't even seem to help anymore. And this sucks because I am actually very fun, intelligent and funny. I used to be the life of the party (with the help of alcohol or being comfortable with the people I was with) and now I literally can't even force myself to pretend I'm fun.\n\nI hate living this way and really don't want to be on antidepressants.. I want to try something more natural because natural things have worked before. \n\nCan someone recommend something to me? I've been reading about nootropics the past 2 days and am very interested. \n\nThank you!!",

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just been wanting to get everything off my chest for so long and this is the first place it seems like I can do that. \n\nA month ago I started seeing a LCSW because an HR lady at work recommended I take advantage of the EAP program after I spent an hour and a half bawling my eyes out in her office. I was there because I knew I was going to have to go back to the hospital and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to. I thought I could work from the hospital because I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave work for that long. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just get that much further behind. \n\nThat hospital at the tail end of December was my 4th stay for the year, 3rd for a crisis. I have Myasthenia Gravis, a neuromuscular autoimmune disorder that causes weakness in my voluntary muscles. I was diagnosed at 18. I grieved. I pulled my boots on and I kept going.\n\nExcept I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to keep going anymore. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not suicidal, but the thought of having to take medicine in 3 hours and 20 minutes so I can stay ahead of the weakness makes me tired. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so tired. I live my life in 4 hour increments between pills. \n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m 23 now. In the almost 5 years since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been diagnosed, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had 5 crisis events that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had to be hospitalized for. 3 of those included a feeding tube. 1 of those included the flu and ICU. \n\nNormally I can push through and get back to routine. This time I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I want to cry. I am crying as I type this. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s different about this time. \n\nMy counselor (social worker? Therapist? What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the appropriate term?) says that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m depressed. She said that the first day she met me. She says I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m scared. She thinks I should quit my job because of my \u00e2\u0080\u0098disability.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Or that they should at least be offering me accommodations. She says that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell my husband or my family how I really feel about my Myasthenia Gravis and that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow them to properly support me like I need them to. She says that I need to bring them in for a session so she can mediate and I can tell them how I really feel. \n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not comfortable with that. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how I really feel. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want them to know how I really feel. I have spent 5 years protecting them from the burden that is my disease until I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t protect them or myself. My husband and my parents are the most supporting people I have ever met. My mom stays with me when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in the hospital. My husband does anything I ask of him, even if it includes picking me up off the floor when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m too weak to stand by myself. But that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to allow them to see me weak. They already see my muscles weak. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be emotionally weak too. \n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to do about my therapist. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m supposed to be accomplishing. I mostly just go in there and cry about stuff and then she tells me more about how she wants to talk to my husband and my parents. She also found out about me being a graphic designer and has asked that I do a branding campaign for her. How do you say no to someone you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only spoken with 3 times about very private matters? Now I feel like there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a line that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been crossed and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to get resolved until I finish the work and stop the sessions. \n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing any of this right. \n\nMy symptoms are getting worse. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that Myathenia Gravis was progressive even with treatment. It used to just be my speech and swallowing. Now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in my arms and legs and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to breathe. I had surgery in July to hopefully help get me off some of this medication and stabilize my symptoms. I knew that the surgery could take 2 or 5 years to work. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize how hard it would be to wait. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize that I would crash. I was as close to pre-MG normal as I had ever been and I crashed. Hard. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to acknowledge that the surgery may not work.\n\nI just want to stop crying every time I think about it. I want to stop thinking about it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a broken record in my head. All day every day. Except all the record is playing is static because I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking about. Am I scared? Have I isolated myself from any help I may get? All I know is I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be strong anymore.

        "Event": "...\n\nThe main event in this passage is the individual's experience of uncontrolled depression-crying in front of their friends after drinking too much alcohol. This event had a negative impact on the individual's feelings and self-esteem, as they feel bad about themselves and are afraid of what others think of them."
