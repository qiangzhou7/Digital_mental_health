I know it hurts. Instead of letting feelings sweep you away, practice approaching them pragmatically.\n\n~Dushka Zapata\n\n.............................................................................................\n\nHow can you begin to live my life in a more pragmatic way?\n\nBasically deal with things in a sensible and realistic manner.**Be organised.** It is a simple thing to do and will have the most effective results in every aspect of your life, be it at home, in highschool,college, in your place of work.  A tidy life, will lead to a tidy mind which in turn will lead to you making better decisions when you need to be sharp, alert and on the 'button' when it comes to problem solving and taking action.\n\n**A confession:**\n\nYou cry and suffer alone. Nobody is there to help you. There is this form of helplessness that goes from you crying nearly every day, till you realize that nobody is there to hear you. Crying then becomes pointless.\n\nCrying is a distress signal, if the signal isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t answered, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s useless. So what happens? Well, your brain tries to find other ways to deal with suffering. As a result of nobody answering your distress calls, your brain learns over time that every single problem that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll EVER suffer from for the rest of your life, you must solve alone. Period.\n\nThe world has given us the middle finger and said \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoodluck dumbass, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on your own!\u00e2\u0080\u009d You learn that because nobody was there for you, you become 99.99% reliant on YOURSELF. You are now the only person you can trust. Everyone else means nothing to you. Why care about someone if:\n\n1. They weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever there for you, and\n\n2. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already learned how to be reliant on yourself, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need people anymore.\n\nYou develop this zenn state where you feel as if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a bit of an odd trance, like nothing really matters as much as you think it does and you stop putting emotions into just about anything.\n\nAs a result of your abuse, your problems stop feeling like problems. I hypothesize that the reason behind this is because when you were having problems, nobody was there to help you. There was no empathy for you and you were always left solving problems yourself.Eventually you just learn to cope with it by looking for solutions instead of self-loathing and whining about it because whenever they showed signs of distress, nobody was there to pick them up.\n\n~Jone Whistler",

Life sucks. I'm sad right now, the most I've ever been sad. I'm on anti depressant, go to therapy, and shit, there no solution in sight. I can't remember crying as much as I did today, ever. \n\nBut just know. All of you sad brothers and sisters. Know that it gets better. Wether you want it or not. Wether it happens in a month, year, or 10 years. Things change for the better. If the world can turn against you, it can also turn in your favor. You just have to give it the opportunity to do so. Non of us want to get out of bed, to work out, to socialize. I know the pain my dudes. But you gotta keep doing it, because the potential for things to get better is there if you only give the world the opportunity to do so. So give yourself the opportunity to feel better. Please. It's a new year. You don't have to be happy, you don't have to feel good. Both of those are the world's job. Your job is to stay hopeful. So stay hopeful, and let life do its thing. It will definitely give back one day. I feel like fucking shit today , but  the moment I press \"submit\" I'm going to brush my teeth, drink a cup of water, and meditate for 5 minutes. Because I don't have to feel good to tell depression \"fuck you!\" in the face. So fuck you depression! ",
