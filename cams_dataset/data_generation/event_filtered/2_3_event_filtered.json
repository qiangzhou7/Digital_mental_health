I have bouts of insomnia, wake up feeling like I've barely slept regardless of if I've had a decent amount of sleep and feel tired through the day. I did all the tests my doctor could possibly think of and I'm perfectly healthy. When we first started my doctor asked if I felt depressed and I dismissed it because I feel the same as always. \n\nNow I'm starting to wonder if it's mental rather than physical. It's been like this for a long time, sometimes better, sometimes worse. \n\nI looked back through a few logs I kept of how I felt when I was so tired I could barely get up to go to work, and I would often write things about feeling disconnected. I haven't thought about it for awhile, but it's still there. It's not strong or oppressive or anything like that, just sort of a general sense of being in a dream, things flow past me and nothing really matters. People stop mattering, I stop caring about stuff I love, that kind of thing. \n\nSo I'm starting to think that maybe I am depressed, but I have a habit of self diagnosing and scaring myself. I didn't really think about it before, since I don't feel 'sad'. But it all sounds like, at the very least, there's something mental going on that's making everything messy. Maybe it's just stress? I don't know.\n\nI think I might look into it more, talk to my doctor about it, that sort of thing. Im at the point where I don't really care what it is that's wrong, I'm just sick of feeling this way and at the very least if I know what's going on then maybe i can do something about it. \n\nIf anyone read this I could use an opinion (I won't take it as gospel but it'd help), some support or even just tell me where to go if this isn't the right place. I don't mind either way, I think it's good to just vent sometimes to think things through. \n\nThank you. ",

Thats how my depression is..Its always in the core of my body, but I muster up all the energy I have within to try and act how I'm \"supposed\" to act: Social, happy, positive, hard working. Today I feel as if I can't muster up that energy. I feel like if I go outside today and put on that show that I put on everyday, I might break down. It is effecting my work. I can't tell you how many times I have called out for being \"sick\" I feel like I need time off to get on medication and see a therapist regular to talk through these times. Has anyone else had to deal with depression and needing time off of work? Should I just explain to my manager exactly what is going on? He knows I get into depressive episodes like this and has been sympathetic before. I enjoy my job I just mentally feel depleted right now. I am trying to start of the new year right by being in tune with my emotions and knowing when to take a step back and be honest with people rather than lying continuously and acting like my depression is a burden to others..Thanks for reading!

        "Origin_reddit": "I'm making this post just to vent mainly. Here's some stuff about me:\n\nI am a mid 20s male. I make good money, enough to save half of it and probably retire early. I have a great girlfriend that is an absolute blessing in my life. I'm decently in shape and used to be a bodybuilder but that kind of slipped away. I'm a smart person, always in the top 15% of whatever academic class. Great parents that support me. It all started going downhill when I went to grad school but realized it was a dead end and started getting depressed. Later I learned that most people get depressed in grad school because it's such a shitty prospect. It has been 1.5 years since I decided to dropout from a PhD and I'm still fucking livid about how shitty it was. Like I can't move my life past it. Now my job is mostly boring and easy but pays way better.\n\nNow here I am 2 years later and still depressed. It's just like I am watching my life fall apart in front of my very eyes unable to do anything about it. But that's the thing, I have it so good that I can't even let my life fall apart. One person told me I couldn't fail if I tried and it's like I'm trying to prove him wrong. It's like I'm trying to fail but I just can't. And I think that contributes to the helpless feeling. At the heart of my depression is just the hopelessness and lack of control that kills me. I want to feel like I'm in some sort of control over my life but it feels like no matter what I do, hard work, lazy, focus on this or that, it just feels like it doesn't matter either way. That takes all of the fun out of life for me. It feels like life turned from a choose-your-own-adventure to a roller coaster ride with a fixed track. No way to get off the ride, just have to take the shit that comes along. I'm slowly giving up all the passions I used to have because I'm either not good enough or I'm worse at stuff than I used to be. I long to be like the 21 year old version of myself. I was so happy then.\n\nBut I'm so confused because right now I live with a guy who is fat, eats unhealthy, doesn't have many friends, is annoying, no college degree, never moved out of this area. Just generally a nerd with little social skills. But he seems to be happy. And I'm so confused. How can I have so much more going for me but be miserable? I just want this to end. I want to just be satisfied and happy with my life but I can't find anything that will scratch that itch. I'm just existing and the only thing I'm looking forward to is getting a dog, retiring early, and getting married. Those are pretty cool things, but it just feels like brain is so fucked that I won't be able to enjoy it. I smoke weed (not all the time) to cope and it helps, but really just delays these feelings like I'm having now. Fuck.",

        "Origin_reddit": "\nI'm 18 years old and a freshman in college. I've had mental health issues for a while, but it has really worsened since about August of this year. I was actually having a pretty good summer, I travelled in Europe with my best friend, saw a cousin who lives in Germany and had a fun week in Paris. It was exciting and really nice. I miss those days. It feels like forever ago. I started feeling weird about a week after I got back. I kept sleeping and sleeping, so much sleep, but I was never rested... I felt tired all the time and always had a headache. My thoughts were really morbid and weird. I kept thinking about my own death, my cat's death, my parents' death... they recently turned 50, they hopefully have many years left of healthy life, but I'm scared to lose them. I started thinking about how life is so temporary and we're moving rapidly along a path toward that inevitable end, each day closer to a painful illness and death... and endless nothingness after that.\nSo I started college in September. I'm minoring in philosophy, and I'm taking this course called Ancient Philosophy. The professor is great. But the thing is, philosophy and astronomy are the two topics that really get me into these disturbing existential thoughts. We're reading a lot about death, and I wrote this paper about Epicurus' views on death (he is the one who said \"death is nothing to us\"). I found it interesting. I realized that I somehow long for death (most of my problems arise from consciousness, and I find it very appealing to just go to sleep forever and never wake up, because I find the most comfort in sleep and am always disappointed to find myself waking up to another lousy day on earth). At the same time, the idea of \"eternal nothingness\" really creeps me out, probably because I can't imagine it and because consciousness is all I have ever known. I missed a lot of class and was late a lot this semester because I just didn't... see the point, I guess. Of doing anything. I thought about killing myself just to get it over with. I know how I'd do it and everything. I really think I will kill myself someday. I honestly am about 75% sure that my life will end in suicide; not any time soon, but eventually. I actually like the idea of suicide. In a way, I am pro-suicide for myself (I would never encourage anyone else to do this, but it's their choice). I find the idea of dying by suicide empowering because something inevitable and daunting is now put into my hands, and I control my own death as well as my own life. I told a friend this once, needless to say my friend was not amused and got worried. I don't talk to anyone about it now, they shouldn't have to worry about me, I just wonder if my thoughts are really abnormal psychologically or if that's rational (it seems rational to me, and it seems like people just think it's \"crazy\" because of the prevailing view in society that suicide is always both immoral and irrational).\nI can't really talk to my parents about this. They don't believe in mental illness. I'm from a Syrian Druze family, but they're very secular and don't care about religion... and I've always found religion to be just a way of getting out of actually evaluating the world and confronting the absurdity of life. And I sort of have a negative view of it because of the destruction that fundamentalism has brought to a lot of people, it's close to the experience of people where I'm from, all for an irrational idea. At the same time I have always been a bit jealous of people who have religion to rely on. Like some of my Muslim friends or ones who are very Christian. They know God is there for them. I don't have anyone or anything. I don't know if I'm depressed. I definitely have been, but at the moment I'm fairly active, but my thoughts are never on what I'm doing, they're always on these existential problems and I'm almost always feeling despair and hopelessness, even when I'm acting social and trying to have a good time.\nI sometimes feel that the world is not real, and worry that it will disappear at any moment. It feels that I am in a dream. I cannot define myself and others always seem like strangers, no matter how close a relationship we may have. Everything seems absurd to me. People I know from school and from my job are always are sighing about essays, exams, homework, work. To me it seems so strange. It seems like people act as though we are not mortal. They don't act like they are aware they will die. In the supermarket or something, I feel an urge to remind everyone \"We are temporary! We will not always exist!\" (Of course, I don't).\nMy life circumstances aren't bad, I've had some difficult things, like I lost a few family members and a friend from childhood. But overall, I should be grateful. My family has money, I've never had to face poverty. My parents love me, but don't understand me. I love them, but don't relate to them. I hope I don't seem ungrateful. I don't understand why I am how I am.\n",

        "Origin_reddit": "So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always been a reserved introverted person by nature and this had not been a problem even when I got to College. I would wake up, go to class, say a few hellos here and there and then go back to my dorm. Little did I know of people and how they actually worked and little did I even know of myself. Anyway fast forward a few times into the future, I met some people who I guess for the first time in my life, I wanted to be friends with. Now, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a guy who readily smiles and is polite etc and I guess something deep down inside of me really wanted to impress these folks (especially since I had no friends at the time). This I now know is a result of low self esteem but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come back to that. So we all decided to room together the following year and I admittedly was excited, seeing as I had only stayed by myself or with strangers before. This is where my self esteem comes into play. We signed up for apartments (3 bedrooms). The first room which was the largest was actually picked and moved in, it remained the two other rooms. \n\nNow these two rooms were built differently, one of which had the bathroom inside (B room) and the other had the bathroom on the outside and was smaller a bit (C room). I made a costly mistake when I actually picked the B room and signed the lease to pay for it, only for me to offer it/exchange it (while still paying for it!). Knowing who I am, I thought this was gesture of friendship or something but looking back now, this was an incredibly stupid and naive decision. \n\nAs the semester wore on, I went from regret to sadness to depressed and just could not live with myself nor could I let go of that mistake. I began to question everything, what made me come to that decision? How could I have been so naive? No one does that. Realizing that it was low self esteem even made it worse. I began making bad decisions after bad decisions. I found myself saying yes to things I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to do, I was suffering inside. I withdrew into myself and went from reserved to just plain silent when in groups especially with these people because I could sense how stupid they thought I was. This wore on me so heavily that it affected my academics and my overall view on life and people. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve hated myself a bit because everyday I pass that room or get the bill, it just reinforces these beliefs. \n\nIt may sound dramatic but its true. The lease will be up in 4 months or so and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait to leave. I have also learned a lot from staying with these folks and from this entire experience even though its been a nightmare. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m having a hard time finding myself again and although its a new year, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be going back to school soon and will soon meet them again.

Also, I'm not a native speaker so baer with me :D \n\n\n2017 was by far the worst year of my life but also kinda the best, because I was finally strong enough to make some changes. A little backstory: I've always been pretty insecure and shy, never had a lot of friends and was pretty quite. Then, I got into a relationship with my now ex boyfriend. He has issues. Anxiety, depression and unfortunately a couple more mental health issues. I've never had to deal with something like this in my life but I loved him and was willing to help him as much as I could. Things were fine in the beginning, even though it was super hard for me. I had to make a lot of sacrifices. He was not comfortable traveling, so I tried to accept it as good as I could, even though I always wanted to travel and see the world. He didn't want to spend time with my family. He dodged every family event, every birthday and didn't even want to have lunch/dinner together with my parents. He said he felt uncomfortable around them, so I did not force it on him. But it didn't stop there. I was not allowed to get tattoos or piercings, even though he knew that this was something I've always wanted. After a few years his mental health got worse. He also has anger management issues and started to get more aggressive. We started fighting..a lot. I started to become unhappy and this is when everything went downwards. Since he didn't want to leave the house, we ate a lot of junk food. We just had it delivered or picked it up, went into my room (I was still living with my parents) and ate by ourselves. Needless to say, I've gained a lot of weight during our 8 year relationship. \n\n\nI started to distance myself from all of my friends, right to the point where I didn't have any. I distanced myself from my family and pretty much everyone around me. I was alone, but I still had him and that was the most important thing at that moment. We had more and more fights and I started to see a different side of him. He was super manipulative and made me feel guilty, even though it wasn't my fault. He twisted my words to make me look like the bad person and he started insulting me. Calling me a the biggest bitch on earth, a manipulative psychopath and a worthless piece of shit. I didn't know what to do anymore. I became more and more unhappy and - after a few years - depressed. This led to me eating even more, because I was so frustrated so I gained even more weight, which made me even more unhappy. I still stayed with him. Thinking that he would change once we move out (as I said, I stayed with my parents and he pretty much lived there with me). As I was still in school and he had no job, I could only wait for me to finish school, him to find a decent job he could keep, so we can move in together. At that time, I also blamed my parents for being unhappy. No real privacy was possible in our house because my parents always wanted to know everything. They were pretty much always up in my business. Anyway, he kept telling me, that things would get better once we have our own place. I believed him, or let's say, I wanted to believe him so bad. But things got worse. We fought pretty much every day and he started to not only insult me but also pointing out my insecurities and telling me, that no other guy will ever want to be with me, a fat and ugly psychopath. He knew exactly what to say to break me. He did this for several years, while I endured everything my mental health got so bad, that I started to harm myself. I felt absolute worthless. There was nobody I could talk to and I was too broken to do anything. I was stuck in this shitty relationship and couldn't see a way out. I did think about suicide but was always to scared of doing it. \n\n\nI dropped out of college and was looking for a job for 1 year. I was on the verge of giving up. I didn't see any point in continuing this \"life\". I never thought I would let someone ruin my life, who was supposed to love and support me. Then, I finally got a job and made some friends at work. I actually really enjoyed going to work and seeing them, hanging out with them and being normal. The more time I spent with my co-workers, the more I thought about my relationship and that I needed to do something. Over the course of 2 years, I tried to break up with my boyfriend pretty much every month. He kept promising to change and constantly told me that I'm the only thing that keeps him alive and if I would really leave him, he would kill himself. He wants me to know that it would be my fault and he would make sure that I would never forget this. I felt like I had no other choice but to stay with him, even if it would destroy me. Fast forward to 2017, one of my co-workers (who has mental health issues himself), became my best friend and helped me through a really fucked up time. He was always there for me, whenever my boyfriend decided to throw a tantrum and blame me. I got to a point, where I almost packed my shit and left for good. I just wanted to leave and be alone. The depression and panic attacks were destroying me slowly. \n\n\nAfter a while, I started to develop feelings for my co-worker and he told me, that he has feelings for me as well. No, I didn't cheat on my then-boyfriend but it hit me \"there are still guys out there, that would want to get to know me, who think I'm pretty and want to treat me with respect\". I finally decided to end my relationship. It took me 4 months. 4 long months full of panic attacks, threats, tears and suicide thoughts to make it but I did it. I'm not gonna lie, it was an on-again, off-again thing with my ex for these couple of months and again, he tried again to manipulate me into taking him back and giving him another chance. I felt SO incredibly guilty for leaving him. I blamed myself for everything that went wrong in my life. We still texted sometimes, because I tried to remain friends but I knew it didn't work. I tried it because of him, hoping it would help him with the break up. Silly idea, I know. After telling him one last time, that I cannot be in a relationship with him anymore he sent me a long message, telling me that I've ruined his life, that I deserved all the bad things that happened to me and that he will find someone better and prettier than me and will make sure that I will never forget what I've done to him. He kept insulting me, like always, but this was the finale straw. I blocked him everywhere. He tried to contact me again a couple of times, sending me e-mails and shit, but I ignored them and sent them straight to spam. I cut him out of my life completely.\n\n\nUp until September, I really didn't see a point and I hit rock bottom. There were times I couldn't leave my bed because this freaking depression paralyzed me. I was scared that I was going to lose my job. I mean, my life was already a mess so why not add unemployment to it. I was done, with everything and everyone. But luckily, I had some amazing friends and my family and they've helped me so much. After finally opening up to my sister about what had happened with my mental health in the past 8 years, she was shocked and told me, that she wished she knew it sooner, so she could help me get out of the relationship. After so many years of feeling worthless and thinking that nobody cared about me, I didn't know how to react to this much love and support. It was a long and incredibly difficult way but I started to hang out with my friends more often, talk to my family and in general, tried to spent more time with them, after ignoring them for 8 years. I kept thinking about the past years and how much I've missed out because of my relationship and my depression. So I finally decided to put myself first. I started to work out, eat healthier and lose weight. I got my first piercing and even though it might not be anything special, it was something special for me. It was the first decision I made on my fucking own and for myself, and only myself. After that I got my first tattoo and 3 weeks ago, I moved into my own place. All of this would have not been possible, if I didn't have the amazing support from my friends and family. \n\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I'm still not okay but I'm a lot better. I still have super shitty days and panic attacks but nowhere near as often as I used to have them. I want to be happy again. I want to enjoy life and in order to do that, I will start therapy soon. Thinking about the last year makes me so angry, sad but also happy. After so many years of psychological torture, I was finally strong enough to put a stop to it and open up to my family and get help. I have so many things to do and so many places I want to see. For the first time in years I'm actually looking forward to the future.\n\n\n\n\n",

I live in Puerto Rico so we've also had to deal with the aftermath of hurricane Maria; university's been delayed for months so any chances for internships clashed with the semester's new schedule.

(No, you don't get a job or internship or whatever even w/ a Masters degree, when you are as much of a loser as I am). Here's the thing though: I have been struggling with depression for a long, long time. It comes and goes in episodes. I noticed that taking the contraceptive pill Yasmin exacerbates my depression. I started taking the pill a year ago, went off it for a couple of months in the autumn, and now I had to start taking it again because my nightmarish hormonal acne started coming back.  My cheeks look like the surface of the moon ffs (just for the record, I'm 25, never had acne as a teenager; it hit me at the age of 22. Now I have both pimples AND wrinkles. yey.) I have tried everything else but Yasmin was the only thing that got me rid of the cysts. I won't stop again. As you can imagine, having a bad, cystical acne AGAIN would make me twice as depressed. With regards to the antidepressants,  I did take Cipralex last autumn but it didn't help really; if anything, it made me feel even more suicidal.\n\nSo, future is grim, but I have to push through, sadly. I am giving life one final chance - 2018 will be do or die (literally) -  cos I've taken far too many Ls so far and I am just sick and tired. If I don't get my shit together by December 31st, it's game over. \n\nDo you have any advice on how to proceed and make it through January? I am looking for some pill or whatever to sort of numb any emotional thoughts/feelings I have and to reduce the frequency of my nervous meltdowns and crying, while at the same time doesn't sap me completely. I need some energy to learn that stupid shit that is required for the exams.\n\nThank you.",

I failed all 12 credit hours in community college last semester and I don't want to go back. I hate my parents and I'm not close to anyone in my family. At this point, I just want to spend the rest of my life in my room, unemployed. I'll receive an inheritance if I'm lucky. My mom gets up early everyday to go to her job where she's been for 20 years. I know I have some major depression issues, but there are lazy bums in this world, who are unemployed and live at home until they're 40, or forever, and I think maybe I'm just one of those bums, regardless of depression.",

I am filled with stress and my whole body itches from bug bites and hives and psoriasis and dry skin. i have rly bad toothaches and migraines and fevers.

I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why I am writing this tbh. I have a lot of trauma and problems w my head too.
