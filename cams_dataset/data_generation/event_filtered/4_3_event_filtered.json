It was then that i decided to talk to one of my high school friend, and we continue to do that for until we became a couple. She is now my ex, she broke up with my, i'd spare you guys the detail but it's pretty much because of long distance relationship, my failure to realize it when she start to lose trust for me, and my stupidest decision ever. 2017 could have been my year, i found job at a place where the co-worker is friendly, and the boss treat me like family. I was in love someone who make me realize what it feel like to truly be in love, who can love me unconditionally. I could have it all, a good job, a wonderful family with her and my kid, yet I fucked it all up because i think too much, i worry too much about the future, about thing that may or may not happen, that i forgot about what important is in the present. I worked too hard for our future when i neglected her in the present, she began to lose trust in me, she was in pain because she think i abandoned her, and I didn't even realize it. Then she made a choice, she decided that she no longer love me and can't continue this relationship anymore. I can't get her to stay, nothing i said matter anymore, i was too blind to see that the girl i love the most was hurt be none other than me. After our broke up, i broke down mentally, i can't feel anything, can't do anything anymore. I was working two job and still in college, i tried my best to stay calm and collected when i'm study and at work. I barely pass the semester, got fired at my second job because i can't keep my mind clear, at least I still have my first job with me. Now, at the end of 2017, i was in that exact same place where i ended 2016, even worse than that. I just hope that i have the strength to go through 2018 without repeating any of that mistake, because i'm too tired of me ruining my life with my overthinking, i try so hard to control it, but i just keep doing that, and it results in me making stupid decision that keep ruining my life.",

        "Origin_reddit": "I met my best friend in freshmen year of college. I had been suffering at my worst from my depression prior to that year in high school. Fall semester of freshmen year was the first time in about 5 years that I almost felt \"normal.\" That friend was my dorm mate. We were completely randomized but hit it off really well since the beginning. We spent so much time together all of our mutual acquaintances would ask where the other was if absent. Then came spring semester and the depression was back full blown. We both have depression the kind right now where you don't feel anything, and nothing excites you anymore. It started to get noticeably worse for the both of us as school progressed. We're both involved in creative majors and so the anxiety of wether or not to chase a creative path is worth it or not is a main form of anxiety for the both of us. For me it's a bit better because art has been something I've been wanting to do all my life and can't see myself doing anything else. Slowly our relationship just began to deteriorate. We'd go to the same hangouts, do the same things, become bored of it, started becoming more irritable with each other, have less and less to talk about, and eventually have nothing at all to say to each other. It was devastating, meeting up for a hangout and seeing that they obviously didn't want to. They have another friend they're close to but unlike me is someone quite extroverted and humorous with a vibrant personality. I'm more shy and my depressive episodes involve a lot of me just wanting to be left alone. \n\nThey're a bit of the passive aggressive type but I can always see what they're feeling wether they say it or not. We had been close for such a long time and then all of a sudden this other friend had become their #1. I've had trauma in the past where friends have left me in the dust so it doesn't hurt as much as it did during those times but it does sting a little. My attitude towards it is that I just give up. I don't care anymore. I see when they third wheel me and I just don't have the energy to give a shit anymore. I want to slowly fade away. I feel like I've tried my best to rekindle what we had, but it becomes a little tiring when it's all one-sided. It sucks that I feel this way on New Years, so honestly I just want to let it go. I have another really good friend which I'm fortunate to have and I will continue to put effort into the relationships that deserve it. I came to rant about this, but I feel a lot better now getting it off of my chest. I'll be looking into seeing a doctor for the first time ever about my depression and I'm feeling hopeful.

        "Origin_reddit": "hi --\nFor reference, I'm 21 and female.\n\nFirst of all, I have a sister who is depressed. I know what that looks like: she contemplates the futility of her existence; she thinks she's worthless and generally has a deep-seated self hatred; on bad days, she cries herself to sleep and on the worst days she doesn't feel anything at all. I support her as best I can, but she often gets frustrated with me because I seem very far-removed from her mindset. I've always been a happy person, self confident (some might say to the point of arrogance), productive, etc. In particular, my sister cares a lot about what people think of her, and she often grows impatient with my inability to empathise with that position.\n\nAs much as I can enjoy living, I have no attachment to it. It's like the self-preservation instinct isn't there. I don't fear death, and I've experienced a good amount of physical pain in my life and I don't fear that either. I often just feel very removed from myself - disassociated - as if I'm looking from myself from very far away. Often I don't think of myself as a person but as a function of my activities (recently, a lot of work). Yes, I love people and I take an interest in intellectual material and I live both for the people in my life and my inner world, but if it makes any sense it often feels like my inner world itself is an external phenomenon, like I have no self. To borrow a line from Sylvia Plath: \"I am nobody. I have nothing to do with explosions.\" And if it offers any insight: I don't cry very much, but when I do it's almost never for myself - it's for something larger and more abstract, like the Holocaust, or the rape crisis in India.\n\nI just don't know what's wrong with me. I can be charming and engaged - I'm a creative type and very tactile. I'm confident in myself. Above all, I am happy making meaning within my own life, at peace with the knowledge that its significance is purely relative. But when I refer to myself it feels like I'm referring to some construction outside of myself, like the 'I' is still some distance away. For that reason, my self-preservation instinct in pretty switched off. I often think of death - not in a longing way, just in a morbidly curious way. Everything I value I can just as easily disengage, because those values seem arbitrary. The world is a beautiful place but it will keep turning without me (and everyone else). I don't think I'll ever kill myself, but my detachment sometimes scares me.\n\nIs this normal, to an extent? Or is something wrong with me?",

There were no presents, there was no family dinner. I spent christmas eve laying on the couch, sick with the flu and fever, eating microwaved pasta while watching christmas movies on Netflix, which honestly makes me even more depressed but I enjoy watching them nonetheless. \n\nOn the day after christmas I spent the day gathering enough willpower and strength to go outside, not because I wanted to, but because my headache was killing me and I needed both painkillers and more food since my fridge was literally empty. Trip to the gas station for junkfood and painkillers was the 'highlight' of christmas for me.\n\n\nOn new years eve I was still a bit sick. I heard the first fireworks go off around 8 or 9pm.
