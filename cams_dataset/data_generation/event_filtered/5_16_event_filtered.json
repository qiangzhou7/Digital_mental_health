Even around those closest to me, whom I've told honestly of the severity of my depression. \n\nIf I don't, I feel worse. I feel bad for bringing everyone down, I feel bad for 'not trying hard enough' to have a good time. Like I'm intentionally doing harm to my loved ones just by acting how I feel.\n\nSo I act, I smile and laugh at their jokes or make lighthearted comments about whatever we are doing, but its an act. The entire time I'm exhausting what little energy I have just to seem normal enough they wont leave me.\n\nBut then... they actually think I'm fine. Even though I have told them it's acting. I've broken down on more occasions then i can count now. Begged for someone to help me. Begged for some support, or even just a friendly ear. And they're always nice while I'm crying, they listen to me blither for a while and promise to help.\n\nThe next day I'm faking it again cause the guilt of making them feel so bad yesterday is overwhelming. I think they'll remember, that they'll ask and actually care how I'm feeling. I think they may at the very least try to check in on me, or pick up some of the slack around the house. They might offer to drive me to my doctors, or really any gesture of support.\n\nBut weeks go by. They act like it never happened, like I never told them how I'm really feeling. So I break down again. Beg for help again. Explain it all again. They think I've actually been fine these past few weeks, even though I had blatantly told them I was acting.\n\n\nRinse.\n\nRepeat.\n\nMany many months later I'm still in this awful loop. I'm doing everything I can to fight this on my own, but I just can't.  I don't know how to get through to them, without making everyone feel worse. ",

It's just the slow climb of every day life realising there's nothing to it anymore.

The numerous parties I haven't gone to, the weekends I stayed home by myself, the pressure of finishing high school, the crap of feeling completely alone in the holidays (and on new year's) have led me to a new low.\n\nI wanna focus on another aspect: people I try to talk to have no friggin clue what to tell me. \nMy \"friends\" act all supportive until I actually talk to them about my issues. After that, it's like nothing has ever happened and life goes on exactly as usual, with the difference that I feel even more like the \"odd one\" in their eye. I actually have no clue how friends are meant to behave in general, so I might as well assume that's how it always goes and it's my fault for having such ugly problems.\n\nSecond, my parents. They think that insisting and trying to convince me to do anything and move my ass, and then getting angry when I either keep saying no or yell at them for what they say, is the way to go. I feel excluded even by them, as if I was a total freak, an alien (barely) walking around the house. \nA few days ago  up even doing the chores they ask me to do and I feel awful for it but I really feel too down to do anything at all.\n\nAbout consueling, I went to one for a year (15-16 years old) but wasn't much useful since neither I myself had a clear enough idea of what was going on. Sure, he could have helped, but maybe I wasn't receptive enough haha. Anyway, I tried going to another one this September, and uh, it didn't go well at all. I felt like my fucking huge suffering was being minimized as a simple teenager thing. Well, it probably started like that, but apparently I was dumb enough to turn it into a much bigger monster :P\n\nAnyway, I really feel pressured by life that goes on. I feel like I'm being left behind. I need to do something. Now, who should I turn to?",

        "Origin_reddit": "I mean, it was both awful and great\n\nJanuary was the last month where I still had my old values and personality, the same goals and the same outlook. I was just an adoloscent who got through 6 months of not enjoying anything really, ignoring it, getting into a short maniac phase and slowly having it ending. Oh, and I watched the Rebuild of Evangelion movies, they were pretty awesome. \n\nIn February however, I really lost it and fell into a deep, deep hole. I had in the first week of it vacation and for the first time in my life, I felt lonely. Normally, I only felt bored when I was alone. But this time, I really, really wanted to have people around me. And not just friends, I also started from this point on to get interested in girls and scince then, I, uhm, \"search\" (that sounds wrong...) for a girlfriend. This was suprising. \n\nI was never interested before in romantic relationships. I had only 2 crushes before and with neither did I want to engage in anything, so I never hit a girl. And it's very awkward to get into this when you're around 16, it's interesting, honestly. So much changed inside of me. I didn't feel weird when I got euphoric about the thought of, uhm, cuddling. Also, I learnt that I have no type. Like, if the girl's skin is clean and she's neither super over/underweight, she's fine in my eyes. \n\nThis lead me to get into a girl I already knew since a few months. I already feared that we maybe won't get this along as a relationship. I thought our personalities wouldn't fit very well. However, this changed quickly as I talked with her about politics and she said that \"those filthy niggers and muslims need all to die\". \n\nThis showed me that a personality problem might not be the thing that breaks the camel's back. I mean, I really doubt that a relationship with a racist could work, mostly because many people I get along with are muslims, and a few family members are, and I really am not a big fan of racism, mostly because I am very mixed and brown. \n\nIt really took away my believe in humanity. And I don't mean the one kind people are joking about. I really believed that the world is at doom because of the ignorance and hate of many, many people out there. I didn't give myself and the rest of the world any future. Everything remembered me on the failure that we are. \n\nAnd then... I think it was on the second or third of March, I got ill. My blood pressure is normally a bit lower than usual, but around that time, it was so damn low I couldn't stand sometimes. It made me weak and fatigued, unconcentrated and dizzy all the time. I got panic attacks, about once a week. Atleast. And mostly: it gave me the feeling of never, ever, just feeling a tiny bit... like, home. It felt like floating in a weird, alien, dark and cold environment, as far away from everything you feel comfortable with as possible. \n\nIt improved when spring started. I still remember thinking \"I am at constant pain, have no future and basically feel as bad as I could, but the sun is shining atleast.\"\n\nHowever, and that was the big turning point of 2016, I got medication against my low blood pressure. Basically some drops that tasted like rotten tangerines (aka it tasted real bad). They worked after a week or so. I was hitting the gym more often to improve my body situation. It was very effective.\n\nNow, to explain how I felt after this, was kinda like a normal situation with my thoughts being as fast as in a maniac phase. It was damn awesome. I was finally again able to do conservation, I knew what to talk about, how to talk and how to be someone people want to talk with. I was a freaking social butterfly.\n\nI didn't give a shit about what people thought about me, I've seen the worst and I knew that some bad thinking and mean looks about and at me aren't as bad as I always assumed they are. I enjoyed my life. I even got out! I played soccer and was at parties and I was shopping with others... I was never really bored the whole spring over. I mean, I still wanted a girl, but I had friends. And I got close to my coworkers, I think I was one of the more popular guys at my workplace. \n\nAnd this is shocking. I also visited in this time my old school and noticed that I really never met many people there and was not popular at all. Back then, I didn't care, but now I felt like I missed some things out when I was just surrounding myself with the people I already know. But now, I knew lots of people and made many laugh. I even got recommended to start stand up comedy once. \n\nBut... It ended way too quick. My mom got between me and my friends. She didn't allow me to see anyone besides people she knew and she didn't wanna know my friends because she was convinced that they were garabage. I mean, she was right, but I am still extremly angry at her for her decision. She killed my social life. \n\nAnd she doesn't accept that she did this. She always says now \"I didn't forbid anything\" or \"Don't make others responsible for your problems\" or \"You can still see people we know\" or \"Just search for new friends on Facebook\". Worst part is that my dad who actually would've allowed me this didn't step into this. Like, not at all. And my sister is now always calling me a friendless loser...\n\nBut this made clear that I don't want to live with those people for a long time. I think once I find a flat and have enough money, I will instantly move out.\n\nHowever, that was not the turning point to my worse. The big turning point was this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5fyp8r/what_was_the_biggest_disappointment_of_your_life/dao3vvs/\n\nFriday was btw a birthday at work. The coworkers I invited stayed longer than they should just for the party and they were giving me a ton of alcohol, a few bodybuilding/porn magazines and a book with bad jokes. It was awesome. I really felt like an equal to people who were all far older than me. It was really awesome and if it wasn't for this, I don't think I could've stayed through the weekend. \n\nI think about maybe doing something with them, even though they are all far older than me, I think I will feel comfortable with this. Too bad that some of them are women and once my parents met them they will talk with me about how I should start a relationship with and marry once I am 18... Man, I mean, I never got hit by my parents. I always got something to eat, drink and to entertain myself, but they are just fucking me up emtionally and I can't even talk with them about this because they will never change. Only scream, play the victim and insult me. There is sure some bias in here, I am in the end not exactly normal with my will for independence and freedom. It's just far bigger than in most others and I feel oppressed really quick, but I really don't feel like it's normal. \n\nI've never seen other children being treated this way and whenever I talk with others about this, they insist that this is defiently not okay what they are doing. \n\nBut back to topic, not all turned immediatly left. I still felt good mostly, made connections to people and was still deemed as funny and entertaining. Mostly because I am a weird guy and have a weird history with many weird things and people in it. \n\nIt did turn kinda left tho over time. As above said, I had a lot of stress in the family. And I had no friends. And I got slower. By autumn, I was depressed again. However, not nearly as bad as ever before, really. I was and am kinda normal with a lean to a depressive episode, but I learnt how to express my problems to others (even though I never told anyone by now about my mental problems) and how to be still productive. \n\nAnd whilst it all got downhill, I am still rather high. I brought just some time ago two people in the same week to cry out of laughter. Or wait, actually, I think it were even 3. I am scared tho of this year. I am scared of going through everything again. And scared of maybe going backwards. But I hope that this year will be more good than bad. Last year was on the other side both the best and the worst year of my life. \n\nOh and: I hope the year will be good for you too. ",

I cried myself to sleep because I couldn't understand the world, nothing made sense to me, just so confused at how anything worked, one day I'm just not going to exist and I don't think I could imagine living forever so what did I want?\n\nI made friends with girls, losing my best (m) friend to football. I became very alone in primary school. I would walk around with only myself to keep me company. \nThere was a 'lunchtime supervisor' I guess you'd call her who noticed I was always alone, I'd wait by this fence for her to come up to me, she always had sweets hahah. We used to walk around together and talk. \n\nShe left and I guess I just always was with girls. People played me, even at that age but it was okay, it wasn't that bad. You know, popularity was a thing even at that age. I had a bestfriend at some point (f) but she was popular and I was wierd. \n\nHighschool came, I choose to be in her form and another girl's, she kind of hated me at that point but we got closer again. \n\nI've always been alone.\n\nBy yr 9, I made friends with this 'alt girl', Idk what you'd call her, she wash speaking to her older boyfriend, always had arguments with him. We quickly became bestfriends and even though I was depressed it was easily the happiest I'd ever been. \n\nI started smoking because drugs always fascinated me and it was the closest I could get. We were both pretty popular, I a friend (m) who was popular that I'd play games with over Skype.  Good times.\n\nYr 10 came and my best friend left me for a girl. It crushed me and I began finding ways to drink, not that it was easy, just a few beers from my mum etc.\n\nI quickly got extremely depressed, I became an easy target now that she was gone and I was confused, I guess I sortof 'followed' them round for a bit which must have made me an easier target.\n\nPeople would make fun of me, call me gay and stuff because of my young shitty appearance I guess. I did try. I think I still played games over Skype with the guy at this point, which was nice, he was nice.\n\nI switched to vaping to cut costs and for health reasons plus I could simply order stuff online. I vaped heavily as it was my coping mechanism along with self harm.\n\nI remember turning into an empty zombie which was good because it let me cope.  I took caffeine pills everyday to keep me awake which actually improved my grades greatly because I've always been so tired.\n\nBy yr 11 things were approaching a sort of neutral line. I hung round with a group that I knew didn't like me but I had always kept a little influence over people.

I finally (though it took all of last year) got meds for depression (fluxetine) I'm on my second week of taking it but I starting to realise that a simple pill isn't ever going to help me. I have gender dysphoria, I hate how I look, I can't stand my past and I'm so alone. I have my new bestfriend, let's call her lucy, we became friends walking home together and when thus other group went to town in yr 11. She has helped me so much and she is the only person that I've told about my depression, I've also told her about my gender dysphoria to an extent. \n\nI'm so alone rn and I realise that this isn't ever going to get better. I will always be a boy and a nobody. I'm not sure I can deal with the fact that I won't ever live the life that I've always dreamt of and I will always be mostly alone. \n\nI am so glad and happy that I atleast have her. \n\nIt just doesn't feel enough anymore, I always think that ending it is just the best way to go. To be rid of my frustratingly depressing life.\n\nUni is going to be so hard to try achieve with my ever falling motivation, I'll try and hopefully go the same place as her and her boyfriend. It feels so fucking impossible to do anything, and I don't think anythings ever going to get better, with a pill and some therapy\n\n\n\nedit: probably tons of fuck ups, just wanted to get this off my chest, I've probably left stuff out and some of it might not make sense",

        "Origin_reddit": "Hello everyone,\nI am sorry in advance if there is any rule that I should follow when posting this.\nWhere do I start?\n\nCULTURALLY:\nI currently live in Canada but I was born abroad. I have been here for the past eight years and to say the least, the country I am from is very stereotyped... It is located in North Africa so I let you figure out the stigma that surrounds it. I feel alone here. I tried my hardest to make friends but none of them stuck around. I tried to befriend people from different cultures and not just stick with my own (a thing a lot of immigrants do when they move abroad) but I feel like that backfired at me... I am not religious, so my own people do not like me and I am now seen as \"the wannabe white guy\". Other people (mainly natives) get to know me but they never want to do anything with me. Truth be told, I arrived here at 16 so all the groups were formed and all the friends were \"taken\". I try to be nice to people. I try to show them the good side of my culture by inviting them to do stuff and actually paying for them (don't think I am desperate, I do this occasionally when I get a good vibe from the person) but it never works. I do very well at school and according to my brother, people do not like me because they are jealous... I am not sure what to think of that.\nI used to have interests but all those disillusions faded them one by one.\n\nEMOTIONALLY:\nI have a rather strong personality but no persona. I am the same with everyone regardless of who they are (except my family of course, who I draw limits with). People think I am too straightforward and too blunt. I just do not like to do things that I do not enjoy doing and my \"friends\" get frustrated and mad at me because I do not follow the rest of the people.\n\nMOTIVATION:\nI do well at school as I said previously, but my motivation dropped drastically lately. I do the bare minimum. Thank god (or the force) I was gifted with good brains that save my lazy piece of shit ass when needed. I feel like I could do a lot more, but my depression hinders every step that I try to take.\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\nMy ex-girlfriend cheated on me, yet I got back with her. She cheated on me with my so-called \"friend\". I got back with her because, on the spot, she apologized and I felt sorry for her because she, herself, underwent severe depression before I came along and saved her. I recently broke up with her because she did not keep any of her promises and also, she is constantly on the move and never really regained my trust ever since I found out she was playing me.\n\nI feel like I hit rock-bottom. I am deeply, deeply, deeply sad.\n\n\n\n**TLDR**; I feel like no one accepts me for who I am.\n\n\n\nI am really down but I would really appreciate any constructive comments.\n\nThank you.",

I've been in my new job for a little over 5 months and over the last month or so my symptoms have worsened pretty severely. The job is technical fault/support in a call centre for a major tv and internet provider. Initially things were really good, having a routine was really helping and I was making mental improvements. Backstory, I graduated university this year with a graphic design degree and this job is supposed to be a stop gap to save up some money to move to a different city with better job prospects as there are literally 0 design jobs in my city. \n\nEssentially I'm sick of working crappy shift patterns, having no life outside of work due to travel times and being verbally bullied all day by customers calling up. Kinda came to a head a few days ago when a customer called me useless and told me I was doing a 'piss poor job' - among other swearing and insults - even though his issue wasn't actually anything to do with my role or even my company, really. I know I'm doing a decent job - my manager and stats both say so - but I keep replaying this conversation over and over in my head and I can't shake it. I'm royally fed up of being spoken to like shit over things I cannot control. I'm waking up and I'm nearly in tears before every shift. It feels like this may be the worst I've been in years.\n\nAlso, if I decide to leave this job I have to give a months notice, which means I have no idea how I'm supposed to look for something else if I'm unable to start for another month. \n\nI really have no idea what to do.

I have no idea.\nI also find myself struggling to communicate with people and get peeved over the littlest of things. For example my parents are always telling me to clean but then they pile of bunch of things into my room or my sisters room to \"clean\" out the other rooms. All this does is make me frustrated because my mom later comes in saying my room is a mess and that I'm filthy even though I'm not even the one moving anything because I've been in bed all day.\nNo matter how much sleep I get I always feel tired and leads me to never want to do anything or have the energy rather to do anything. I do have insomnia and on school nights I would only get about 1-4 hours of sleep depending, but at the current moment on break I'm going to bed around 8am-noon and just sleeping until I absolutely have to get up.

It would be maybe half of a slice of pizza or a bowl of cereal and that would be it + 1 bottle of water for the whole day, then I go right back to sleeping or go on the computer and watch twitch streams.\nI am in pain a lot. It's usually either one of my legs or I have headaches, but I'm used to having headaches almost everyday. I also don't like talking about how I feel so I tend to keep to myself, but as of recently I have kind of just been locking myself away in my room and staying on my bed.\n\nI honestly have no idea if I truly could be depressed and should somehow convince my parents to set up an appointment for me or if I'm just lazy. Or if I should just go to the doctor on my own since I'll be 19 this month and could technically drive myself there. I just would have to get the bill sent to my parents so either way they'd find out. The only times I actually feel like doing anything is if I'm able to force myself out of my house. I don't know if it's something that I should actually get checked or if my parents are actually right and I'm just downright lazy.

I was diagnosed with depression in year of 2011. Since then I have sought out treatment in the form of talk therapy and medication. And in all this time, even before I was educated about my \"illness\", not once has anyone I've come into contact with been able to see the world with my eyes. Yet I can be so understanding and kind and caring and able to walk in the shoes of others. I want to make others smile, be happy, and laugh. It's why I'm reading, studying, and practicing to become an actor. But I can no longer hide behind this mask of false images and hopes that \"things will get better\". How is it I can live a solid twenty four years on this planet, down to the exact seconds from which I was born today, being part of a sociable species of animals dubbed humans and still not have a genuine connection with a single person? How? Bar forced seclusion and isolation practices, it should not be possible. I should not be possible. Yet I persist and endure and struggle to live as a thing. A creature. A human not worth the very effort it took to create and make this pathetic existence I call life something worth living. My therapist heard a similar story to what I have just written from me, (minus the whole being alive for a full twenty four years part), and it sounded like she was trying to contemplate an answer to justify my thinking as being a product of my depression. By this time tears were sliding down my face one drop at a time. Yet I felt as stern as an emotionless being. Then she said something that caught me off guard in a voice as sad and as hurt as a mother pleading for the safety of her child. She said, \"please don't hurt yourself\". The thing is, I can't understand if she was crying for me or for what I had just said being reflected off my face. And even if she was starting to cry......., why? Why cry for someone who has no place in society. Why cry for someone who cannot be fathomed by his peers or parents? Why cry at all for this hollow wound of a human she saw before her? Just why?",

        "Origin_reddit": "I'm glad to have found this page for broken souls. Like most of you, I have no one to talk to either. I certainly have no friends and haven't for a very long time, but I do have a family that loves me and even a wife. But I can't talk to them. See, my family doesn't understand the depths of my depression and I certainly can't explain it. Words fall short, tears choke out the ones I do try. No one knows me. My wife does, better than anyone else, but no one really knows. She's asleep on the couch right now cause we had another fight. \n\nMy depression has been extremely severe for the last year, and the past couple months it has really been spiraling beyond my control. My anger and irritability are off the charts. I can't eat, but I'm starving. I'm so tired, but I can't sleep. I feel like every moment of my life is just spent suffering, waiting and wondering when it will all finally end. I just keep praying I'll die in an accident so I can be at peace without having to feel guilty for hurting the people who love me. I never leave my house anymore, I can't go into grocery stores or gas stations because I can't bare to interact with people. I can't work because the depression is so debilitating. Ive started having panic attacks and extreme social anxiety. I feel like no one likes me and I don't blame them. I hate myself, I hate having this severe depression, I hate what it does to me and the people I care for, I hate that it makes me useless. I would give anything to just be normal. I want to function like a normal person who can shower and go get groceries and talk to people and feel ok and work and contribute something. \n\nEveryday I wake up, I sit in my house all alone all day long staring at the walls and trapped in my own head, then I try to sleep again. I don't want to even move. It's gotten so bad and I'm so afraid of finally killing myself that I went to the doctor a few weeks ago even though I have no money, job or insurance. They did an MRI of my brain with and without contrast on the 28th and I am waiting for the results. I feel that I must have a brain tumor or something. I'm scared of how I feel and I am losing more control everyday. \n\nI'm almost 28 years old, I have 2 college degrees, a loving wife, a house, food, family...I had a good life for the most part, I mean it could have been a lot worse and honestly, situationally my life is better than it's ever been before. That's why I don't understand why my depression has gotten so bad right now. I've been depressed officially since I was 17 but the first time I tried to kill myself I was in the third grade. I don't want to kill myself anymore, although I fantasize about dying constantly. I'm not selfish enough. That's why I really want some help, I've lost control several times recently and all it takes is a few seconds to end your whole life. I don't want to do that. But no one understands where I am at right now, not even my wife and we have been pushing each other away for months.\n\nI recently tried to battle my loneliness and for several months I tried making new friends and reaching out to old ones that I had lost. I kept it up daily even though it was exhausting for me. I never even once got the slightest indication any one of them cared or wanted to be friends or even liked me at all. It sucked and it hurt and it made me retreat farther. I used to be popular in high school and have tons of friends, I dont know what is so unlike able about me now. I guess I am awkward and don't have much in common with most people.\n\n\nSo.....what am I supposed to do? I just want to be better. \n\nMy next step I think is going to be writing to this sub Reddit regularly. I need some place to get my thoughts out and to say how I feel, even if no one is really listening. God knows I've fucking tried everything else.",

I don't get really good grades, my family isn't too great, and my few friends will head somewhere else. I am probably going to be a loner in college, and I have no talents or anything. I'm super insecure and I just don't see any hope. Which says a lot considering that I am in a terrible situation right now.\n\nDoes anyone feel like life is really cold? I don't enjoy anything anymore and it's really just terrible. No one loves me and I wish I could go back to when I was a kid.

So ive just given up on doing anything. It won't matter \nNobody cares about me anyway, I just am alone.

My emotional support animals are becoming emotionally drained from being there for me so much. My boyfriend is stressed from working the holidays, so going to him will only add more stress. Ive only met my new therapist a few times, so I dont yet feel comfortable telling her everything detail for detail yet. I dont know how I will be able to make it through the year, sanely. I often feel that the only reason I can live to see tomorrow is because of my boyfriend, my small dieing family, and my three bunnies. If they all leave this year, I don't think I will make it. What is my next step? What do I do?\n\ntldr; Depression is kicking full blast for the first time in years.
