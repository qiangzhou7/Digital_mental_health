I'm 17 I live in Sheffield, England and for the past few months I have have been dealing with depression and it is tearing me apart LISA (love you if you get that reference). In all seriousness, I feel so disconnected from everyone around me and it scares me to death. My 'friends' are all busy with relationships or with their own friend groups which is a thing I've never been apart of, I've always just had friends who had friend groups so I would be in a weird position. I often have very self loathing style thoughts and have very little to no self esteem. I feel like my friends are using me in a sense that they only call me if they need help with college work or I'm the last option because the rest of their friends were busy. I can't do anything though because I don't want to risk losing the few friends I do have. They all come to me with the stories of the great nights out or the holidays they all have planned and when they ask what I was up to, which is rare, I just have to say \"nothing\" and it makes me so deflated. I haven't felt genuine happiness in months and that is due to the lonliness, I would get back out there and look for someone but I have no confidence in myself so I'm terrified to do so. I can't feel like I can talk to anyone about it because they shouldn't have to put up with it which makes writing it here a bit ironic but oh well. In summary I'm scared. I'm scared of what the future holds, what happened in the past and I'm scared of the present and I'm not expecting any sympathy or world class uplifting guidance I just needed a place to vent.

I seem to have relapsed back into the previous rant shitposting that I'm more than sure that some people might recognize.\n\nThe other day, I was literally called ugly by my own mother. I can't escape reality now.\n\nThis is what i look like.\n\nWhen you see my face from the side, my chin literally goes back into my face. I'm so fucking horrendous.\n\nI can't stand it. I am so angered at, nobody in particular... but only myself, I guess?\n\n------\n\nI hate being Indian. I don't hate Indians. I love our history, our culture, our languages, our people... but I hate BEING Indian. I hate having to explain to annoying \"progressives\" that think that India is an extremely misogynistic country or the like.\n\nEven if it is, I don't see what I have to do with it? Why can't I be associated with the thousands of Indian men that marched for the rapists to receive justice? Nope. Guess I can march for my country's women, get hosed by the police, but I'm still an evil Indian rapist. Great.\n\nNow that's not something I've gotten more than twice IRL, and dozens of times online but I hardly care about the latter, but I still wanted to mention it.\n\nIndians are seen by everyone, even Indians themselves, as undesirable. It's a pain.\n\n------------\n\nThis is what I look like: https://imgur.com/a/FGuQM\nhttps://i.imgur.com/SE9jxxp.jpg\n\n-------------\n\nNow the weird thing is that I don't even know if I have a sexuality. I sometimes imagine myself as asexual.\n\nThis is because:\n\n1. I find breasts and women in general to be attractive\n\n2. I am repulsed to sex and vagina (receiving oral sex or a handjob is the only thing I'm not repulsed by)\n\nI wouldn't classify myself to be asexual, but possibly I might be?\n\n--------\n\n--------\n\nIt's not even with dating or girls, I don't have romantic feelings to people or anything. I'm sick and tired of having been born flawed and ugly like this, and feeling ugly.\n\nI don't know why I even dislike being ugly, because it's not like I care about it possibly impacting my relationships or friendships or anything like that.\n\nFor a while, I seemed to forget about my physical appearance.\n\nIs physical appearance just the elephant in the room?\n\nWhenever people talk about physical appearance like this, and call themselves ugly, the number one point of advice they receive is \"you're not even ugly.\"\n\nWhat about the fact that, according to people I've asked IRL and the internet /r/amiugly and /b/ and even this subreddit, I am ugly?\n\nWhat do I do then?\n\n\"Ugly\" is literally an insult for things. I'm supposed to deal with the fact that my presentation is a literal insult?\n\nI'm fuming.\n\n/rant over",
