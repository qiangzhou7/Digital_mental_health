I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think people believe how debilitating this is for me on these days, they think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being lazy or weak, that maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just not coping with a normal bad day that everyone has and chickening out or using it as an excuse, because a lot of the time I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m either able to present myself as capable and functioning, or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m actually feeling great and normal and a whole world away from this shit. I just am not physically capable today of very simple things. \nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the energy to talk through all of the shit I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve dealt with and all the things I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve felt and to tell all of this to whichever medical professional for them to then dismiss it all and tell me there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing there and they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help me. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too much and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to organise it all or prioritise what to say. So I got to the point of just not telling them much at all, whenever friends or family who cared about me told me I must go to see a doctor, and then obviously that all goes on record saying I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty much fine every time. \nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just scared that when I feel better in a few days, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have ruined it all for real me. When the fog lifts and I do give a shit about life again and feel normal it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fucked up. ",
