Here is my reasoning behind this feeling, most people I know or have met when I was smaller said I was really charismatic, outgoing, etc but that I changed all of a sudden what I can guess was when I was around 6-7 based in the few memories I have. I became serious with out any sign of change and now I don't care about anything, but mean absolutely anything it is what can only be described as \"detached\". It could have been from suppression of who I am since that age because of people having expectations for me resulting in me not developing any real hobbies/interests  and knowing how to express my likes/dislikes or due to some other events that led me to suppress myself. Anyway that's my guess but I still don't know why I don't care anymore and how to move forward.",

No one wants to hear about your depression and the things you go through that suck. All they want to hear about is how successful you are, the jokes you have to tell, in general, the positives you can add to their lives. If you think you've found something different I promise you, you haven't, you're just missing whatever that other person is getting out of you. \nAs shitty as this sounds, once you know this, you can rearrange your behavior to reflect how people really feel. Why try and talk about your depression with someone? In the end you're really just bringing them down. It's better to focus on something positive or if you can't just make some space and don't talk about anything at all. The people people love to be around are \"always in a good mood\" or \"always down to have a good time\". Chances are these people have issues as well they probably just handle them better. They know that no one really cares about their problems, and people just want someone they can have fun with so they play them game. And when these people can't play the game anymore they spend sometime alone. Sure, maybe some people are just naturally happier than others but that doesn't mean that even naturally unhappy people can't use the same strategy. They might just have to spend more time by themselves. \n\nUltimately my New Years resolution is to keep more of myself to myself, to be more positive around others even if I don't feel it within myself and most importantly, to take that time to myself to know when I can't put on the face anymore.

She doesn't even know I exist. She lives thousands of miles away, is super succesful, and has a loved one of her own. \n\nDoes anyone else emotionally attach themselves to people (like entertainers, celebrities, idols, etc.) almost as a form of escapism, but know that you'll never meet them and it hurts? \nI personally am a huge fan of one specific band/group member, and she makes me really happy, I'm just trying to emotionally detach myself from her because I'm afraid her group is going to disband in the near future and she's going to be out of the public eye.
