Back then people would tell me that I was funny, chill, nice, I was genuinely interested in people and made friends easily. But now I feel the opposite, like I'm just a dick, I never want to hangout with my friends and these are guys I have been best friends with since I was 5. We were literally inseparable, but now even keeping up with them in our groupme has become a chore, at this point my friends don't even want to talk to me anymore. Recently even the thought of having a social interaction is so scary that when it actually happens I feel like I seem distant and uninterested causing people to dislike me. I wish I knew how/why this all started, I just want to be me again, not this boring asshole who never has anything to say. I haven't told anybody this because I'm afraid they either won't believe me or think I just want attention, and I really just don't know what to do. Its like I just want to be left alone but I know that is not how I want to live my life. Sorry for the rant I just feel lost.",

Parent's are obsessed about my future uni and I can not give them what they want. No matter how hard I try, everything turns out wrong. I leave home at 7:40 AM and comeback home at 1:00 AM and during that time I study, study, and study. But my grades are not getting any better. I started dozing off everywhere, whenever since 2014 and it is not getting any better. I punched my thighs so hard during classes to keep myself awake and since then there are always bruises all over my thighs.\n\nI think my depression started because I was lacking of affection. MY mother always wanted more and I couldn't give her what she wanted. She never encouraged me but scolded me because she thought I was not trying my best. She wanted me to be awake until 12:AM so I study like every other sons and daughters of my mother's friend but I couldn't. So I had to stand up and study in front of my mother. At school I took depression test (My middle school made me do that every year) and obviously my test's result said I have very low self esteem and I am suffering from depression. My mother found the paper and asked me about it and I could clearly see disgust in her eyes so I had to tell her I misread the questions.\n\nI asked my friends for help at 2013 and my mother got so embarrassed about the fact I want to die so bad and I told others about that. And she screamed at me because I made her embarrassed. \n\n2014 I took depression test again and my teacher helped me a lot. He offered my mother to make me meet the counselor. My father disagreed, claiming everyone gets moody sometimes and I am acting like a baby. (But he never treated me like a baby nor child. I had to do everything by myself since my parents were busy taking care of my younger sister.) And my mother supported me for few months until my father told my mother it was a waste of money. I started to sleep a lot because I didn't wanted to anything and that's when I started to doze off.\n\nMy mother bought me liquid medicines that is good for my health (according to what she says) but I didn't want to drink them. So she grabbed my face and poured it into my mouth. She stopped doing that when I chocked on it and threw everything up.\n\nI did cut myself few times and my mother was so embarrassed about my existence so I didn't have to go to church or big family meetings.\n\nI also got bullied few times and my parents did not give a fuck. They claimed I was being to gloomy.\n\nI don't have friends, I don't have any talent, my grades are getting lower, I hate myself so much and I don't even have courage to kill myself.\n\nI am sick of my life.\n",

To star off the year my special needs aunt who was only one year younger then I (I am 22) died of breathing compilations due to chronic pneumonia. She had the brain functionality of a six month old baby, but we all loved her and we knew it would happen sooner or later.\nThen not long after that I had to quit my job, drop everything and use all of my savings to go help my mother because she has a bad heart and it has only been getting worse. At that point in time she was in the hospital and they didn't think she would last the month. She ended up OK and is still around. I really didn't want to go because for my entire life she has been an alcoholic and a drug addict, and how she got her heart condition is an overdose of meth that blew up her heart. Thankfully she has pretty much given up the meth.\nI was living with her for about four months all of the while being belittled and degraded by her boyfriend who stole money from me all of the time despite the fact that it was me paying for everything. Her friends weren't much better. Eventually I had enough and I moved back here to to live with my grandparents as they needed help because my grandfather had a stroke and later became for the most part paradise. \nThat was the next part of this year that destroyed me. My grandfather due to the strokes and a few other things ended up getting dementia and it got so bad that eventually there was nothing left of him. For most of my life he was the only father figure because my parents were terrible people. He died in his sleep in October. It was also around this time my battle with depression (something I have had a problem with my entire life) started to get much worse and I started to make plans to kill myself.\nI only have a few friends and because I was having problems and was distant at times they all started to push me out of their lives until I pretty much begged to be let back in. These are still the people I hang out with, thankfully it has gotten better with them. At the same time my boyfriend (I am bisexual if that matters) dumped me because of my depression. We were planning on moving in together and I was going to propose.\nI am writing this because I can't sleep or I don't want to sleep because tomorrow is my eighteen year old and four month pregnant sisters funeral. She was killed Christmas day at six in the morning trying to get to our grandparents house for Christmas. She was hit by a car and was dead on impact. She was the only person I could ever %100 trust with anything, and I am afraid my mother and grandmother are next to go and I don't think it will be much longer because of their health.\n\nSummary: Aunt 21, grandpa 70, pregnant sister 18 died and I am afraid my mother and grandma are next because of health problems. Ex Boyfriend (I'm bi) I was going to propose to dumped me because of my depression. I was used by everyone I thought I could trust, and I tried to kill myself a couple times.\n\nI just don't know what to do anymore. I truly don't know how much more I can handle. I have to be the pillar of strength for my family and I have been for all of this because I hide how much I am hurting. I just wish it would all end and honestly the only reason I haven't been able to kill myself yet is because I am terrified of death.

I fooled everyone, including myself, that I was slowly but surely getting better. Truth is, I just kept it locked away, like I always do. Recent events in my life have opened up some wounds, and I'm realizing the depression I felt 10 years ago in high school is still there. Feelings of being a failure, feelings of letting people down, feelings of not wanting to live are resurfacing. I'm not saying I want to take my life, but I don't want to live. Suicide would be cruel to my loved ones because they would have to deal with that twice. But if I didn't wake up tomorrow, I feel like that would be the best from everyone. I'm a miserable person, I'm selfish and I'm toxic. But I'm charismatic and I've hidden all this away for so long so no one knows my true pain.\n\nThe truth is, I basically killed my sister. I know that's what many family survivors of suicide say, but I knew my sister had some troubles. She was sad, she had been caught cutting and making suicidal threats for the past couple of years. And yet, I chose to ignore the warning signs because \"If I could get through it, she could.\" My dad and her got into an argument one night, and I didn't help her. I even said aloud to my brother, \"She's going to kill herself one day.\" A month later, she did. If I wasn't so selfish, I would have helped her, but I just wanted to get on with my life.

We never do anything, my dad is just lazy and for the most part only wants to watch tv or YouTube. My mom has a neurological disorder that makes her sleep a lot. But now I believe that she's just being lazy as she has gotten better. I believe that if she change her sleeping routines and go to bed and get up at the same time every day she won't sleep as much. Then she can seek a new job and start working again. She worked as a teacher before.

Anyway one strange phenomena was about 2 weeks ago when we had the opportunity to choose who we would want to learn a \"Just dance\" dance with. We could choose to be 2-4 people per group. I didn't really get into any group so then I asked my closest mates if I could be with them but they were already 4. So they said that i could go to the group with 3 people. But I didn't, it did not feel right. So next lesson we wrote down who were in which group. And we started arguing in which group I would be in. But the group with three refused to let me be with them for no reason. It's strange because I used to hang out a lot with two of them before. Many of my class mates was on my side and started to get angry and upset that they refused to have me in their group. But they had already decided, it was impossible to change their mind. Soon a mate that I've known for a long time who has always been supportive let me in his group. And now we were five in one group. The strangest thing of all is that the two mates who were in the group with three. We are still going home together as usual, joking around and just having fun.\n\nNow in Christmas time my cousins have been here celebrating Christmas together. First my younger cousins were here and just as they were leaving my older cousins came. At first everything is great and all but then my cousin who is two years younger than me is starting to get annoying as he always do and questions everything you do that he think is strange. And when you try to argue with him about it he's too stubborn. So you cannot prove him wrong. But what is most annoying is when he always does as you don't want. He's 13 years old but behaves like a three year old who always do the opposite as you want. And the worst thing is that I can't just leave him. If he comes to visit me he will stay for a long time. \n\nAt New Year's eve. We were left at home with our grandpa while my younger cousin who's 11, my and their parents went to a NYE feast at my parents friends house. Me and my cousin needed to cook food for the evening so we did. Afterward we went to the city to watch a firework show. When we went home again we saw that my younger cousin was at home so we asked what she did home and she answered that their mom got drunk and dizzy. It was unbelievable because she never drink so much alcohol. Later at the night my younger cousin wanted to watch Netflix on her brothers iPad but he didn't allow her as usual and they started fighting I don't know what's wrong with him but he has some kind of disease. The fight went down intensively until my grandpa shouted at them to be quiet. Their dad hadn't got home yet so they called him and said that he needed to get home  instantly. We waited about an hour but he didn't come. We called again, he explained that it was hard to get a taxi at that time. But just as we hung up their mom came down and was insanely angry she almost threw our iPads on the floor. We instantly ran upstairs to go to bed. The next day my younger cousin was upset about what happened last night and screamed that she was an idiot. She didn't get angry and realized her mistakes to drink so much. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore everything just seem so meaningless. It feels like I won't experience a great life because of all the bad things that happen to me. I hope that you can find  solutions for my problems.\n\nI'm sorry if I didn't use the correct grammar. English is my second language and I'm writing this on my iPad.\n\nThank you for your time, I really appreciate it!\n\n\n",

        "Origin_reddit": "I don't really know where to start, because I literally do not understand myself, but I guess I just came here to see if anyone could make me feel a little better.\n\nI have always been an anxious person, always one of those people who worries about the smallest things and blow it up in my head, and I have had bouts of depression but they seem to come and go. I think the problem lies in that I hid this well from my family having lived away for university for 4 years, and when I came home I felt so happy to be back with them, that they never saw me at my bad state.\n\nI have been living at home since graduating, and all has been fine. But I feel I've completely fucked up christmas, having thrown a complete crazy on my family.\n\nI arrived home from a trip to Slovenia with my boyfriend late on NYE - about 9:30pm. They'd waited for us to eat and mum had spent all night cooking. On the way home my phone broke, and for some reason it put me in a horrible mood - usually I'd relax about this but as soon as I came in the house my mum said to 'just chill out and leave it until tomorrow' and said 'it's because you treat these things badly' and for some reason it made me go CRAZY.\n\n I knew I hadn't treated the phone badly and for some reason i felt so angry that I wasn't allowed to be worried about it (because I worry about my family alot). But I completely overreacted, stormed upstairs crying and shouting about how much I care for them and how they don't care for me, and from then on the evening went MAD. They all ignored me which made me get worse, although from their perspective I probably looked a bitch so I get why, but it made me so mad so I started screaming and throwing things around (again, I have NO idea why I did this, I see RED when I get in these moods). My sister came up and tried to talk to me and said it 'wasn't worth crying over' which again made me mad and I was screaming and screaming about how they should care about my stuff too. She lost her shit then, slammed her door and went to bed. Then my Mum got really upset, packed a bag and went walking, saying she couldn't be around it (she has PTSD, and has struggled with it for ages). Dad followed her, they returned an hour or so later. When they returned, Dad came to speak to me, I confessed everything about my anxiety and bouts of depression and feeling sad sometimes, and that I was sorry. But then I heard my Mum and Sister whispering about me being annoying or something, and I saw red again. I stormed downstairs, started screaming and hitting myself in the head with scissors, and  screaming \"how come they don't give a fuck about me?\". Sister comes downstairs, grabs me by the scuff of my jumper, shouts \"if you don't fucking shut up I'll get you sectioned myself you're being pathetic\", slams me down on the sofa, so I slapped her in the face. I DO NOT hit anyone, never have, but I felt threatened by her and annoyed that she somehow just didn't feel at all supportive. But i get that it would have been a shock to her. She was pissed at me. Lots of crying on my part and we all went to bed. \n\nThe morning came and everyone was so weird, although my Mum and Dad sat me down and said they would make me a doctors appointment. But I don't know if I need one? I have no idea why I reacted so badly, but 50% of the time I am completely happy. 50% of the time I worry like mad, constantly worrying about family dieing, or if they're happy, if my boyfriend is interested in someone else, if people like me, if I'm hated... alot.\n\nBut I have NEVER felt so bad now. I feel like I've destroyed the one thing I was certain on, my family. I feel like I've destroyed the happy, innocent view they had of me and I'm now seen as a crazy bitch. I feel like I ruined NYE and that was the last time we'll have together for a while, as my sister lives far away. I feel like I've just fucked up everything. I can't stop crying, I can't stop going over that night in my head, I'm not hungry, I feel hopeless, I feel like my family will never be the same.\n\nAnd I know I am probably being irrational but I just feel so shit. I want everyone to be happy so badly and I feel I have hurt that, when they have other things to be worrying about and demanding jobs. Now they'll look back at NYE and hate me for it.\n\nI know this is a really long story - sorry. But I feel completely alone and I want the tears to go away, because I feel very overwhelmed. I really wish I could go back to that night and act like a normal person, because if that was the case we'd all be sat around together watching a film and being happy, but we're not, and I miss that. It doesn't happen often anymore and I fucked it.\n\n",

        "Origin_reddit": "My life is a complete fucking mess. I don't know if this is depression, some undiagnosed mental thing, or just me being under the illusion I'm somehow special and need help even though my life is normal\n\nI guess I've always felt some depression. I never really fitted in. I was always the most unpopular guy in school by a long margin and just kept myself under the illusion that I didn't give a fuck, I could sort my life out later and not worry about it. I have never had very many friends, if at all, in real life; and found myself turning online for people to talk to. I'm too fucking anxious to talk to people in real life. Over the past year or so I began speaking with a guy, my age, with similar problems to what I have now I suppose. We grew closer and closer, he told me he was transgender and wanted to become a girl. Cool, I'm totally ok with that, hey maybe I can support him during transition in the UK - he was in the US. Of course, it was kinda inevitable that since we were already so close we fell in love. I was 100% sure I was straight but it's the first time someone had ever shown love to me and I loved him so much, and we were determined to make it work. Over time we planned out our lives, I guess an escape from reality, and I felt I'd met my life partner. Over time though, I began feeling more and more shit. Some days I felt so damn in love nothing even mattered I was so happy and upbeat, some days I hated myself, didn't want to wake up, feeling empty. We broke up yesterday which, I'm not gonna lie, has contributed to this, but even before that, before then I felt bad, I was just trying to gloss over it. The breakup was on good terms and immediately after I felt relieved in a way. Now though everything is haunting me - thinking of anything we did together, listening to any music they suggested or even that I played while we were messaging causes me to literally burst into tears. I can't speak to them about anything without having an emotional breakdown. It's made me realize how alone I was, a reality check. It's made stuff worse but definitely hasn't caused it.\n\nRight now I have one person I'd truly consider a friend in real life, and complete anxiety to speak to anyone else. I feel so damn lonely, this Christmas has been awful. I don't have many interests which makes it difficult, computing is probably my main and when anyone asks about that I honestly can't tell if they're being serious or just sarcastic. I used to trade stuff to make extra money but that became an obsession, buying and selling for even the tiniest profit, and now it all just seems pointless. I'm reckless with money, deep into savings parents lent me trying to \"start a business\" - \"I can easily repay them\". Nope, I'm thousands in debt already to a fucking emergency fund and I hate myself for being so naive into doing that. I've kinda lost my interest in everything now, everything seems pointless, and I'm just left browsing reddit pointlessly or watching youtube all day listening to the same repetitive music.\n\nEven before then I had thoughts that I want to sleep and never ever wake up. That I hate living. Nothing truly suicidal - I could never face death, but mentally in a way - giving up, that everything was pointless. Sleeping is my only way to escape from the shitty thoughts I have, from anxiety in anything social.\n\nThroughout the relationship I had what I called \"negative thoughts\" - what if I didn't love her, what if... etc. I put pieces together with something that has been going on throughout my life that I'm guessing is very mild ocd - pathetic things like triple checking the gas burners are off before bed, having to step on the same paving slab, type evenly on a keyboard - it's all very irrational and does not make sense but if I don't do it my mind says \"if you don't do it then so-and-so won't happen\". During the relationship this got bad as the thing I wanted most - the relationship - began to be the go-to for everything and I was literally double or triple checking everything, my mind insisting I did everything evenly. It's not happening as much now because there's nothing I want, inserting death into that situation has no effect.\n\nThese have also been complimented with always worrying about stuff, something I've had for a long time. Irrational fears. I can't tell which thoughts I have are real and which aren't. I've been worrying I'm gay, or I'm transgender, or I'm asexual, completely irrational since I've identified as straight cisgender all my life, and the thoughts will not fucking go away. I have so much anxiety speaking to girls it's making those arguments worse, and of course the relationship is like, even though I fell in love with her viewing her as a girl which she really is if he's transgender, \"you fell in love with her as a guy and of course that makes you gay\". I'm struggling to hold a conversation with friends for fear of going on or being judged, I can't even start a conversation with any girl about work or whatever.\n\nEverything in life just seems pointless like there's no end, no point in working, no point in anything. I haven't done a single piece of homework, always excusing my way out of it. I can't concentrate for more than ten minutes. I have GCSE mocks in two days and I haven't revised at all - I just find myself getting distracted - then I cut internet and just fall into depression and crying uncontrollably. I'm gonna fail them, everyone is telling me I should be aiming for A*s but I'll be lucky to fucking pass them like this. We were meant to revise over Christmas and I've spent the majority of my time crying about self-pity, worries, loneliness in real life, regret, anxiousness, and lack of motivation; and then staying up until 4am to try make the mess that was a long-distance relationship work, not getting up until 2pm. It was fucking stupid, it's my fault, but I just keep putting shit off and once I do try to focus I give up. There's no fucking point.\n\nI look awful, acne is covering my skin, I only started giving a proper fuck about personal hygiene properly as the relationship started so my acne is probably some of the worst ever, I can't see it ever going. (The only other treatment left that might work is this shit that has possible side effects like \"suicidal thoughts and depression\" and I worry shit like that is gonna push me over the edge). I'm stupidly tall, over 2m yet under 16yo, my body is a mess, I'm ugly as fuck and I can't ever see someone being attracted to me, ever. I'm awful at sport, I swim but have lost the motivation to because nothing seems to fucking matter anymore.\n\nI don't even know why I made this post. It's a mess. I'm really hoping it's just getting over a relationship but seeing as this happened before it ended and in the past before I even spoke to this person I don't know. I just hate the fucking thoughts in my head telling me to do things, or irrational thoughts that I'm struggling to judge if they're even irrational anymore. I can't tell what's real and what's fucking with me. I can't concentrate on work, I can't hold a fucking conversation, there's nothing I'm good at, I'm the most unpopular guy ever and I'm worrying I'll never be able to get over this fucking mess I called a relationship let alone even initiate another one. Everything is pointless. My mood is constantly swinging between crying uncontrollably about everything, chucking everything on the floor, kicking shit with anger and self-hate, and then happiness and hope, rarely though. I started writing this post feeling awful, now I feel very slightly better, but I know I'm gonna feel worse in a bit.\n\nI don't know. My life shouldn't be fucked up. This is probably just me being stupid and overhyping things like I always tend to do and I'm really fine but in the darkest times I know it's more than that. In the darkest times, every couple of days, I just want my life to end. Is it depression? I'm really not sure - I can't be sure on fucking anything it seems.\n\nApologies for this being an unjointed and unreadable mess, like everything I gave up halfway through but this time pushed myself to finish.",

She won't admit that she is though, nor will she see anyone about it. \n\nWe used to see a counciler together, but stopped because she claimed it was making things worse.\n\nThe whole story:\nIn March of 2015 we had to move for me to start my career, she was pregnant and the baby was due in a week. Before this we lived an hour from her parents for college and she went to her parents every weekend to visit, even if i had to stay to work. My wife was going to stay with her mom since they lived closer to the Dr we had been going to.\n\nI started the job and my son was born the next day after my wife got rushed the the ER. Very eventful, but great day. Wife turned out okay and have a healthy son. After a week we got to go to or apartment, which is around a 2 hour drive from her parents.\n\nFast forward a few months, she started missing family, we've also been driving up to stay at her moms place at least every other weekend. Then in November after a few weeks in the hospital her grandmother dies. This drives her over the edge the first time. She talks about how much she needs to live in the country and not the city. How much she can't stand where we live and is crying most days.\n\nWe then look for a house in a rural area, I never planned on staying in the apartment anyway, but we were already in debt from moving down here, now we are moving again, luckily we managed to avoid a down payment and closing costs. We have nothing in savings, as we are constantly going somewhere, she thinks we need to go on a date, and she's to tired during the day to do anything so all we do together is clean when I get home from work. We are now living in the only house we can afford in a rural area. \n\nFor a bit she is okay. Still need to go out, still visiting family(which is really just spending the weekend at her mom's house and she sleeps in, we don't actually go visit the rest of the family that she complains she misses and says that we don't see enough). \n\nAbout 6 months in she starts again. She's homesick. I don't know what to do. For a bit I was setting a psychiatrist and was getting help for my depression, but I just don't see the point anymore. The one I was seeing no longer works for the place I was going to so they canceled my appointment and I never rescheduled. \n\nWe agreed to try and move to the half way point of here and her parents, but I don't think it's going to change anything, except put us in more dept and all she says is she doesn't care about the money. Only way I could think of to attempt to move was fix the crap wrong with the house we are living in and attempt to bring the value up. We still owe more than its worth and she just wants to sell it and buy a new place. We have a son who is about to be 2 and nothing in savings. \n\nHer mom does not help this either. They talk on the phone every afternoon and her mom always brings up how much she misses us and can't wait for us to visit. It'll only have been a day after we left their house. We don't really visit when we are there just stay over. Her dad works and her mom watches TV and gets on Facebook.\n\nHonestly if it wasn't for my son I wouldn't want to be here anymore. My company offers life insurance and mine is at $20k that would go to her right now. That would be enough to bury me her to sell the house and get what she really wants which seems to be to live with her parents. \n\nShe's also talked suicide and I don't know how to handle this.

He still gets out of bed to hang out with us and he just graduated college. \n\nBut he gets very emotional when he drinks, and is either really happy or really sad. When we all hang out, as a group of guys we all make fun of each other because that's what guys do, but are careful not to push his buttons too much. He broke up with his girlfriend who he cheated on a few times, but keeps texting her wanting to get back together with her. He always wants to talk about very sad things, and doesn't ever act happy when he comes out with us.\n\nWhat I don't get is if he's depressed, wouldn't it be hard for him to get out of bed? He invites us over his house to do stuff, but then just wants to talk about how sad he is and it makes me and our group of friends not want to hang out with him anymore.\n\nI've tried to help him the most, listening to him whenever he asks me for help, inviting him out, and offering advice when he asks for it. But he never listens to me, and just blames his \"depression\" all of the time, and it's really dragging my friends down (not so much me though because I don't let his feelings affect mine, but it does get exhausting having to listen to him go on about this.)\n\nHe says he's going to a psychologist for help, but that he hates going there. He hasn't talked to his parents at all about it, and refuses to tell his older sisters either, which is surprising because he does have a very supportive family. Their family isn't the best shape financially, but it certainly isn't the worst.\n\nI feel like he's more so upset because he compares himself and his life to others, and granted things haven't gone his way all the time, but that's normal, is it not?\n\nPlease help me, is there a way to determine if he is depressed or not? Is there a way to suggest he find help? Or is my friend just playing a game with us to get attention?",

Unfortunately, my girlfriend has been diagnosed with both, and when things get bad, her parents actually are a road block to getting better. Her mother actually slightly understands, and lets her take antidepressants (which she hasn't actually been on the last few months because she is too anxious to go to the pharmacy) but when things go bad, she is on the brink of suicide, and her parents will yell at her for sleeping late, or taking too long in the bathroom, and it only makes things worse.

Turns out one of them stole about 750-1000 eu from my room + A LOT of weed.\n\nI sell weed to get by because i was blown away by how expensive living on your own is. Now all of my money is gone and i'm 1300eu in debt by my dealer.\n\nMy gf was the only one  trusted and i (still) love her dearly. But unfortunately she broke up with me just now because she can't be with someone who has such a negative self image of himself, and because i was never there for her (i did everything i could but sometimes you just can't do shit because of the depression and she doesnt believe that). She also said that i am selfish and that the whole relationship revolved around me, wich was the saying that hurt me the most.\n\nI completely lost track of my own to get her to feel good, but nah she wouldn't have it. Commenting on my best friend who is jobless atm but worked HARD everyday on roofs and such for 2 years, saying he's a loafer with no ambition and i will become the same as him got me running to my car, bawling like a little kid (wich is something that nearly never happened in the past 5 years, i'm pretty 'cold-hearted'). \n\nWe just returned from a super nice city trip where everything was as good as it could get, wich gave me hope because i tought that might be the spark our realtionship needed (we've been struggling in our realtionship for about a month) but i guess she didn't think so...\n\nEveryday i have this urge to just drive against a pillar or off of a bridge but i can always come to my sensen when i think about my parents, who support me A LOT.\n\nBut lately even that doesn't do the trick. I wake up and think about the best way to kill myself.\n\nSo; i try to escape. Benzodiazepines are my love now, but i know i gotta quit that shit asap. Unfortunately this can't be done atm. \n\nI'm too weak to do it sober.\n\n\nI don't even know why i bother writing this because no one gives a fuck about me (except for my parents probably) and this'll get buried anyways.\n\n\nI looked forward so much to celebrate my bday (14 january) with my gf in a cosy restaurant and its all gone to shit.\n\n\nSorry for the weird text, im fucked up on benzos and alcohol and english isn't my native language. This could be a goodbey, idk and idc frankly.\n\nFor anyone who read all the way to the end, thanks",

She started off by giving very blatant signals, so we started being flirty etc I asked her out and the date is in a few days, she was my +1 to a new year's party and we cuddled most of the time and kissed and as she left I walked her to the car. Then I talked to her yesterday morning  and I haven't talked to her since but she has seen my message. I know I'm overreacting and over thinking but I can't get over all my stress and anxiety about it, I realize it's likely nothing but I'm very stressed out.\n\nUpdate: were 17 so her mom found out there was pot at new year's and said she can't go on our dinner and movie date but we will be going on a lunch date",

I started to eat healthy, lost weight, even went out a lot and hung out with some girls that I would have never had the balls to talk to before.\n\n-\n\nFor some reason, I became confident, determined, and enthusiastic about life in the blink of an eye. Well that all changed when I woke up to an ambulance arriving at my house and carrying out my mom who had just collapsed. Me and my sister thought it was just a small thing, we did not realize that we would be in for the worst news of our lives when our dad got back from the hospital.\n\n-\n\nMy dad arrived home with our grandparents and started crying as he explained to use that our mom had just died from a heart attack. She was only 49 and had no health problems. My whole family broke down crying as I just stood there in shock, I didn't cry, I didn't say a word. I just stood there with disbelief.\n\n-\n\nThe second day of the new year, and I've already lost hope, as I'm sure my sister has too. I believe she died because of so much stress that a heart attack was caused, I know that she had been very down lately and I felt very bad for her, but I never said anything to her to explain that I was feeling the same. I feel like if I had just said something, maybe just maybe she would be alive, BUT I DIDN'T. \n\n-\n\nNot only that, but I never got to say goodbye, I didn't get to hold her hand as she died. I didn't even get to go to the hospital or see her in the morning, I didn't even get to say goodnight the night before. All I can think about is how much I miss her, I just want to hear her voice one more time, go on one more walk with her, something. But I can't.\n\n-\n\n**EDIT:** I am incredibly grateful for all of the kind and empathetic words that many of you have commented below. I have read everyone's comments and it greatly pains me to know that many of you guys have had similar situations, but it has also helped me a lot.

If you do, I'm open to comments and suggestions.   If not, thank you for your time. \n\n  About 4 months ago,  the (39f)woman (37m)I love of 10 years went from \"I love you\" to \"I'm blocking you\" in the span of a week.  In a text at that. I have tried reaching out to her, but received only venom in return.  She was my life, my happiness, my fiancee,  and my drive. \n  The back story is long, and while I would love support and ideas, I don't really expect anyone to read this or care.  I just have no friends,  nor am I good at making them.  So, this is the only Avenue I can think of to try, nor am I a good writer.   Also,  this is on my phone,  so sorry if I miss any autocorrects.   So, here goes, it will be long, but, as this is more because I don'tknow what to do,  understanding would require a good amount knowledge of me.  While this is long, sadly,  it's only scratching the surface. \n  I suffer from depression and anxiety.   In the military is was diagnosed with Bpd.   I have never been popular or had many friends.   I try here and there to make them, I usually wind up being the target for people to make fun of.  It has become a place in life where I just fit in.  The doctor said my depression will never go away, and all I can try to do is mitigate. \n  To start, I was conceived due to my mom's depression.   While I was due in December,  she decided to force labor in Oct.   Unfortunately,  I lived.\n  When I was 13, my parents divorced over drugs.  Both were in a bad place.  My dad told me if I didn't go with him, he would kill himself.   So, being a child,  I chose to live with him.  At that point,  we moved around to the point due to his contract labor,  I went to 17 highs schools.   Making friends became impossible.   \n  Because he was strung out.  He was making me pay rent to live at home at 16.  My mom would not let me go with her because she was bitter.   So, went to school and worked full time.  Until I turned18, and joined the military 5 days later.\n  In the military,  people come and go all the time.   So, I didn't make friends because,  well, I was used to that.  However,  I wound up being made fun of regularly .  Mainly because I liked to read dungeons and dragons books to escape reality.\n  I went out and met a woman,  who I dated for 3 months before making the mistake of marriage.   While I was out to sea, her and her boyfriend cleaned out my life savings of about  $30,000.   I flew home for us to transfer unawares to \"here's the keys to your truck, I want a divorce,  goodbye.\"\n  I moved because I had to.  And met a girl who thought it was a fun game to mess with me.  Cheating and coming back crying.   Because of this,  I used to sleep with a loaded shotgun pointed at my head.   Finally,  one night, I was getting drunk and ready when.  When I had the gun in my mouth,  someone walked in,  and called the cops.  So I spent a while in the hospital. \n  I then met a different woman who got pregnant. So, I married her (46f)so she would have insurance for the baby.  Which was my oldest daughter.   The wife quickly got pregnant again and had my son just before I was out of the Navy.  She was from Texas, so when I got out, after 7 years in, we moved to Indiana.\n  In the need to find work,  I took a truck driving job, where I received a letter in the mail that I had a 10 year old son.  Long story short,  the girl who took my virginity had gotten pregnant and never told me. I was hammered with support and much back support,  putting me in a position where I lost everything.   The woman only wanted the money,  and while I get I did the deed, after 10 years, I had made many choices this knowledge would have impacted greatly. \n  The wife, knowing I loved my children,  would then cheat on me regularly,  always threatening to take my kids away to texas if I didn't like it.   By this point,  I made little working in customer service.   So, I couldn't afford a lawyer.   And in Indiana,  men never get the kids.  So, she did whatever she wanted,  virtually holding me hostage to my kids.\n  Then, I met this (39f)woman.  We became best friends.   She was engaged to someone outside the country.   We would sit and talk for hours.   We did everything  together,  and our kids did things together.  We actually had everything in common.      Her new husband,  wound up being a lazy mommas boy.  And while she tried over the next couple of years ,  he just couldn't be motivated to...do anything.   She then while I didn't notice,  started doing things for me like dying her hair blonde. \n  Her and I decided to try to make better futures,  so we went to ITT together.   After class, always talking for hours.   At this point we had known each other for roughly 6 years.   One night however,  it hit me.  Where I accidentally told her I loved her.   I knew I thought it,  I guess,  in a way where it wasn't my active thought,  but, I guess I didn't realize how powerful it was.  \n  Some back story on her.  She grew up being made fun of also, suffered from depression,  and had a rather uncaring mother.  Her first husband who fathered her children abused her, and the second took advantage.   When I tried to make more friends,  she got upset.   So when I talked to her about it,  she preferred it to just be us.   Once I understood,  I complied.   More people meant more chances of getting hurt.  Once she felt someone hurt her, nothing mattered, they were the enemy.\n  Over this time,  there was never a time she called me for help i didn't come running.   I actually liked helping her.  Seeing her smile,  just...made me feel good.    From helping her find a place to live,  to mowing her lawn because her husband couldn't be bothered.   I never once told her no.\n  After I told her I loved her (call her k), with my wife being pregnant again,  things changed.   She told me she loved me.  We spent hours discussing it.  Like fate brought us together .  The wife, who had had more boyfriends,  one who's wife got her fired I believe got pregnant on purpose so I wouldn't leave.  I work, I pay bills, and I have nothing I can do about it. \n  I talked to the wife, and she agreed to let her move in for a 3 way relationship.   K then left her husband who moved back home,  and moved in with her and her kids.  This was not a bad thing until the wife got jealous.    I spent my time with k, letting her do what she wanted,  but anytime I was happy,  it made the wife upset.  So, eventually things bored over and k moved out and in with her mother. \n  The wife went back to her \"other\" friends while still threatening me regularly.   The relationship with k became mostly by phone and weekends since she was now an hour away.   Also complicated with poor Internet at her mom's, so messages didn't always get through.  Sometimes having to send multiple before she would get the notice.  This continued for a couple of years.   Though,  any time she told me she needed me I was there.   Bringing her and her kids with us anytime me and my kids did anything.  Hell,  if she wanted anything,  I would jump through hoops to try to make it happen.  To be honest,  anything that made her smile, made my day.  Our love, and friendship was what kept me going.   K also became attached to my youngest.   \n  Before my daughter came, this year I was planning for a divorce as my kids would be old enough to choose.  And support for my son ended. However,  a couple of lawyers told me a judge won't split the kids, so she would get them. Then I wouldn't be able to stop her from moving back to texas. \n  So, in March, k told me things needed to change,  and she gave me some rules.   Like no \"relations\" with the wife.   I think I understood what she was wanting.    So I came up with a plan to give her what she wanted.   K was going through some rough times.   I had to give her what she wanted without stressing her out.  So, I didn't tell her about it. \n  I spent the next six months in solitude in the bedroom.   The wife sleeps in the den.  I needed to do a few things.  Make it easier on the kids to move away from me by making them indifferent towards me.  Make it easier on me by getting used to not talking to them so much.   Then buy time for support for the other child to end.  While having time to talk to a lawyer,  and start preparing for a divorce. \n   I checked with k regularly in order to be sure we were good.   For I was going stir crazy.  I ended up stressing out k.   I didn't realize that even though I grew up alone, how much being around her regularly meant to me.   Right at a time when her work and kids made seeing each other difficult.   I'm sure I was driving her insane.   I was trying to protect her, and in doing so screwed up.  I got jealous she was talking to her ex husband.  Jealous over trying to get time with her.  \n  She was having trouble with the relationship with her son, problems at her underemployed job, car problems,  problems with money, among other things.   So I set out and worked on getting her a job that would have started last week that would have paid double what she was making. \n  In August,  support was over, I set up a date with her.  I had this big dinner planned.  Ready to tell her everything,  ready to tell her I was about to give her everything she asked me for.   I was as excited as anyone can be.  She canceled the first time because her son wanted to do something with her.   Since she was working on building a relationship with him, I got that.\n  The next week was my son's birthday,  which I checked everything with her.  She promised everything was fine, that she was ready for us to finally be together,  and she loved me and we made love.   So I made plans for the next weekend with her, for telling her everything.    A couple of days later, I got into it with a lady from work to the point we were yelling.   I went to smoke to calm down, with a text telling me she was canceling because her son just made his first girlfriend and her family invited her over for dinner. \n  I screwed up.  I called and asked if she was blowing me off again.   She hung up.   So I screwed up again and called back like 20 times.   Finally,  we talked.  I apologized.  Then, that Sunday,  we're were texting and she just disappeared.   I sent a few messages over a few hours tryingto reach her.  One, my youngest wanted to talk to her, two, I wanted to tell her about a show, and 3, I wanted to remake plans to tell her about everything, that everything she asked me for was coming true.\n  I woke up to a text, that I was smothering her, and that she was done with me and blocking me.   I was lost.   I tried to explain,  but was blocked before I could.   We had been best friends for 10 years.  Lovers for 4.  And all I got was a text.  I tried emailing from a couple of different addresses.  Sending flowers.  She told me to fuck off, and stop being a stalker.   \n  I let the wife read my emails to her.  So she understands I will no longer be held hostage.  However,  k never either read them or cared.  She just went 180\u00c2\u00b0.  I've never let anyone..in before.   It only meant pain.  She said I was a manipulating controlling jerk.  But, I never didn't do anything she asked.  Ever.  I wasn't allowed to question her, so, I just complied.  I didn't mind, except like anyone,  I can get emotional,  and at times had trouble not asking questions. Her love was worth it. \n  We used to sit and talk all night.  About anything and everything.   We would sit on the porch,  and talk from sundown to sunup.  She became part of me.  Part of my every thought.   We had everything in common.   Most people thought she was my wife. When we were physically together,  the world was good.    She was going to be my only support in losing my kids.\n  Now, I sit here, having given up everything for her, and she will never probably speak to me again.  I love her.  I wasn't depressed when she was around.   I have no friends.   I have no outlets that don't make me think of her.  I have nothing.   I never got to tell her, because I wanted to protect her.  My depression has drove me back to drinking.   I can't afford therapy.   I don't have anyone in the world who cares.  \n   If anyone actually read this.  I'm the type that \"everything will work out\" is just empty words.  Fate I believe meant for me to be with her.  I no longer know what to do,  or how to continue. \n  All doors are closed.  I can't seem to find an open door anywhere.  I'm broken.   I'm worthless.   I'm having trouble finding reasons to not end it.  I wasn't supposed to survive being born anyways.   My life insurance would help set the kids for life.  She was everything to me.  After a lifetime of being made fun of, people hurting me, she broke through and made me feel human.  Now, this is gone.  No explanation,  on a text.  I must be worthless to throw away that easy.\n  \n  This is just more details.    Adding on as I go.  Maybe someone can help me.   Or, maybe my story will make someone else feel better about their situation.   Either way,  I'm laying it all out there.    \n\n  The job.\n \n    I explained earlier that k also suffered from depression.   She did the cutting thing.  I won't say I don't understand as over the last few months,  I have considered it.  We spent a lot of time discussing our depression.   Going over the ups and downs.   She had been mistreated by family and the men in her life.  I made her a promise to not be on that list. \n  When we worked at the same place, we made one hell of a team.  She always had the best evaluations.  Right up until our new auditor made a mistake,  took it to our new boss, who was prone to jumping the gun before understanding the situation.   So she was let go.  This crushed her confidence.   While I was able to later research and show it was an error on their part, it was too little too late. \n  Then she had a period of unemployment,  being turned down for various positions.   As I watched her fall apart,  all I could do was comfort her.  Always reminding her how awesome she was.   Though,  she quickly became numb to me telling her so.  Then she took a position as a security guard just to pay the bills.   Totally underemployed.   All I again could do was try to remain positive for her.  Reminding her how amazing she was.  However,  she started to reach the point where she felt like it was the best she could do.  Knowing she can run circles around most everyone in almost any type of analytical work, it was not easy to watch.\n   A few months later,  I was let go for much the same reason.   I got lucky and found a good position in production logistics analytics.   While she was happy for me, well, you know.  \n  Then she called me up telling me she was done with her current job due to b.s. she was dealing with.   Then she was fine with it.  Then she was done again.   I didn't know whether to push or what.   Push too much,  she would get angry.  Don't push,  I'm not helping.   She means the world to me.   Not an easy spot to be in.\n   Honestly,  she's better than me at everything.  So, after I had been here for a while,  I just happened to report to a plant manager.   While I'm on good terms with the other plant manager.   I'm also good at my job.  So when I told them I knew someone better,  they were very interested.  However,  she doesn't think she interviews well.  So, I worked out something awesome with my plant managers.   They would help her resume, then give her a \"mock\" interview  to help her out.  Let's just say , the job paid much better,  and it was hers.  This was part of what I was working on that I never got to tell her was set up.  She would have started today on January 3rd.  \n  I work for great people,  so while it's a fast paced job due to \"just in time \" production.   So the job especially since its a larger corporation really a diamond in the rough.   Not to mention,  you literally decide your hours based on your responsibilities.   Making things like doctor visits easy.  With full benefits from day one. \n  This was huge since when support for my kids kicked in,  I wanted us to be able to support ourselves without having to scrape by.  Also, allowing us to do things for her kids and mine.\n\n  Anxiety. \n  When we started school,  she had major anxiety issues with being in a small room with a bunch of people.  So, I had to work hard to make her focus on me, and not the room.   My issue is the same yet different,  as I have trouble with moving masses.  Like the mall is overwhelming to me with tons of people going all different directions.   She was the only one who ever helped through things like this.  Keeping me focused on her.  \n  My other issues are more like just missing her.  In ten years,  we hadn't ever been not around each other for a full week.   She was my .....Center.  when she was around,  my back pain stopped,  and I could relax.  She was amazing. \n  \n  The move out\n  The night she moved out was a messy night.   The wife had been pushing her to find someone else.   So, she started talking with a guy several states away.   K was very...inebriated.   My daughter  admittedly rudely, read some stuff over her shoulder.   \n She yelled at her and went downstairs.   I was told something was up.  When I asked, all she yelled out the door was for her kids to get in the car.   So, I busted the door open to stop this.  I was not going to let her drive, especially with the kids in the car while wasted.   I argued with her to call her mom.   When I went to stop her, she went off (I don't blame her, the wife made the situation unbearable) and started hitting me.   So, I grabbed her and held her through biting me enough to leave a mark for years.   I let her up when she agreed to call for a ride.   I was probably wrong here, but, I was worried about people I loves safety. \n  Her memory of the night is completely different,  as I held her against her will.  She just wanted to wait in the car for her mom whom she said she had already texted.   She didn't tell me at the time, nor did her mom when I called her.  But, I guess I was wrong?\n  This was the only physical encounter.   To be honest,  I was amazed at myself.   I think I would have lost it with anyone else in this world.  This by the way,  made me realize how much I love her.\n  \n    The ex\n\n  I don't know why, but I would get jealous when she would talk to her ex.   He's half a world away.  So I get I'm being dumb.   But, it was still painful to me.   She didn't understand why, I couldn't explain,  so it was a running issue.  While he was not husband material,  she did want to be friends with him.  Have to admit,  I can't be all wrong here, since she found it so easy to get rid of me.\n\n  No one will probably read this much.   But, I want to get everything out there.  Again,  there is more, but, I'm having trouble typing this because my anxiety has me shaking.   I wish I could erase her from my memory.   I just don't know how.   \n  \n  The bubble.\n   She has a personal bubble that she lets very few people in to.  I get this as I have it too.  If you see her in general, she would prefer you just pretend she didn't exist.    I also usually feel the same here.  Our bubbles,  oddly seemed attracted to each other.   We could both deal with someone when we were together.   Split us up, and it was right back to square one. \n\n  The breakdown \n  At one point,  I had reached my breaking point.   Now,  I'm used to back pain from anxiety.   It's become part of my life.   There however was a time I just completely snapped.   I don't remember much but crying.   Expect that at one point,  and Angel showed up and took me in her arms.  The pain stopped.   Problems stopped.  The world was a new place.   When I realized it was k,  I knew at that moment,  all movies and stuff aside,  she was the one.  The you wait a lifetime for.

It's not that I don't care about them, I just like talking to my friends a lot more. \n\nHowever, with parents such as these, they're constantly not allowing me to have the friends I want, do what I want, or make my own mistakes. \n\nThey're keeping me trapped in an endless cycle of stress and sadness. My grades have failed because I simply can't keep up with my severe depression. But they don't get that.

No. They're a bad influence, weed smoker, etc. \n\nNot that I have a friend to run to, anyways.

I have never told anyone, even complete strangers what has happened to me, because I don't trust anyone. \n\nDepression has made me way too critical of people's ulterior motives, so trust for me is an issue. Those two friends I trust wouldn't listen to me if I had a problem anyway. \n\nNot to mention my parents keep trying to send me to therapists and the like, even though I can't tell them what I've done, for fear of getting shamed/disowned/arrested etc., and even though I've told them this they don't care.

        "Origin_reddit": "For the past few months I've been going through a tough period of depression, but a month ago everything changed. Warning: long.\n\nFor the past year my parents have been fighting constantly. Their fights slowly grew in number and severity at the beginning of 2016, peaking in the summer and falling afterwards. January-May, June-August, August-December.\n\nAt the beginning I tried hard to not let it affect me, I genuinely believed I was fine, and that the fighting would pass. After all, my parents have always had a rocky history. Unfortunately the fights only grew, and I began fighting my mom. My mom invested a large amount of time into alternative healing, something I am strongly against. I hated it, I still hate it, I still get angry at my mom for falling into these traps. I want her to realize that her problem has nothing to do with toxins, imbalances, alkaline levels or mindfulness, the problem is her. Her as a whole.\n\nI tried arguing this for months, to no avail. Overtime I guess it all got to me. The constant stress, the hatred towards my own home.\n\nThe mental problems first began at the beginning of the year. During this time I had constant racing thoughts, I was unable to maintain a clear head. I also felt extremely anxious at this time. Little things would cause me to become extremely anxious, such as being out and about with my own family. I was always afraid someone was watching my every move, even at home. I guess this counts as paranoia too. This affected me physically too, I was uneasy, my stomach hurt quite often. I was exhausted easily.\n\nThese feelings slowly disappeared, replaced with new ones in the summer. At the beginning of the summer, around June, I created a list of things I wanted to learn over the summer. I wanted to be productive over the summer. I never completed a single task on that list. Over summer I simply failed to complete anything. I would start projects, and never complete them. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if it has anything to do with procrastination or depression. I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily sad, I simply failed to function. I would like to note that the fights both with my mom and between my mom and dad were at their worst during this time.\n\nFall and winter were the worst. I slowly became more and more depressed as the realization that my parents were officially going to divorce. My inability to function fully carried over. I would come home, fail to do my homework, or any work for the record. Even sitting at my desk and wasting time became exhausting. My parents fights decreased in number and in severity, but they affected me more than ever. I \u00e2\u0080\u009cblew up\u00e2\u0080\u009d often during the summer, exploding in anger, but around this time I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel anything but sadness and hopelessness. I was too tired and too depressed to care. Not just about my parent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s situation, but about school, about life. There were some rare times in which I had suicidal thoughts. I hardly cried, but I was completely broken on the inside.\n(READ LIST)\n\n-------------------\n\n*Ups:*\n\n**High energy**\n\n* Shaky\n\n* Hard to stay still\n\n* Lack of need for sleep\n\n* Pacing\n\nExample: Once on a trip to Malaysia, my family was eating dinner, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. It was around 8:00PM that day and all I had was a red bean bun, one cucumber sushi roll and lots of water throughout the day. That night I felt so energetic that I had to get up out of my seat and walk around the restaurant in order to calm myself down. I was unable to calm myself down substantially, and was still highly energetic but I was a bit calmer.\n\n**Paranoia**\n\n* Loss of trust in others, even close family members and friends\n\n* Believing others to be plotting against me in some form\n\n* (Mixed with delusions) Thoughts of monsters trying to hunt me down\n\n* Thoughts of people trying to kill me\n\n* Government surveillance\n\n* Loss of trust in those close to me\n\nExample: On the way to the airport in December my mother, sister, grandparents and aunts split up in different taxis. My mother received a ride from her married friend. (This friend also has children.) My mom came a bit later than us, as she got lost. However I strangely acted out in paranoia, accusing her of having an affair with the man, accusing her of cheating on my dad. I lashed out, and raised my voice in the middle of the airport.\n\n**Strong, Sudden in Self Confidence**\n\n* Arrogance\n\n* Godlike feelings and delusions\n\nExample: Once when I was feeling up I texted my friend the following(each line represents a new text, this is unedited):\n\n&gt;I feel another late night coming up\n\n&gt;See nobody understands\n\n&gt;But you fo\n\n&gt;Do\n\n&gt;I'm a fucking genius\n\n&gt;You know I was watching this show\n\n&gt;This guy\n\n&gt;He says\n\n&gt;\"I always ask myself if I'm the most powerful man in the room, and I generally always am. That's what drove me for years.\"\n\n&gt;Great great quote\n\n&gt;And I'm reading this book\n\n&gt;On prioritizing what's important\n\n&gt;There's so much for me to clear out\n\n&gt;Tonight I'm hammering out that surveillance essay\n\n&gt;My paranoia's also back\n\n&gt;You know when I get home there's so much for me to do\n\t\n&gt;I'm so fucking amazing\n\n&gt;There's so mich\n\n&gt;I'm only here for 100 years tops\n\n&gt;I better be fucking remembered in 300\n\n&gt;I'm going to meet Snowden\n\n&gt;I'm going to get essay published\n\n**Feeling out of touch with reality**\n\nThis one requires a longer explanation, when I feel this it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if my life is a movie, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m watching it. I see everything I do and though I may regret it immediately afterwards, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop myself. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a strong feeling and loss of self control.\n\n**Increased agitation**\n\nOnce again a feeling that requires an explanation. I get really easily angry during this state, and tend to lash out at people, even yelling at them. \n\n**Strange delusions**\n\nThis one also requires an explanation. One constant delusion is the idea that my life is specifically a greek tragedy. In a way this ties in with my self confidence boost, as I tend to feel like I am extremely important and a guaranteed powerful, historical character.\n\n**Racing thoughts**\n\n**Anxiety**\n\n* Sick stomach feelings\n\n* Shaky self\n\n* Feeling of \u00e2\u0080\u009cbombardment\u00e2\u0080\u009d mentally\n\n**Work motivation**\n\n* Feel the need to do a ton of work\n\n**Increased mistakes**\n\nAs was shown in the message transcript, I made several spelling errors, and in texts that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something I rarely do. For the past year or so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve refrained from making spelling errors and using standard text acronyms. Making mistakes in texts and emails is a rarity for me. I also tend to misread things.\n\nExample: One Monday my dad reminded me to take our water bottles outside for a refill on Tuesday, the next day. He texted me this reminder. I immediately misread the text and assumed he wanted me to take the water bottles out that day, which made no sense to me as the bottles are collected on Wednesday mornings. I ended up engaging in an argument with him on this through text, freaking out and getting extremely angry with him. Only later did I realize the mistake I had made. Mistakes like this have been made several times.\n\n**Memory problems**\n\n* Tend to forget things more\n\n**Feeling disconnected from self**\n\nI really need to write this one out. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been looking at old pictures and videos of myself, and while I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me. I feel as if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m losing myself. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know how to put it, but I just feel like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not myself. I know my name is OneAnonDepressed but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m me. \n\n**Loss of hunger and appetite**\n\n**Lack of sleep, but still energetic**\n\n* This has led to several bad experiences, one detailed below.\n\n**Strong, strange, dangerous urges**\n\n* Urge to jump off of high places, but not suicidal\n\n* Urge to throw my phone down in anger, happiness while laughing for no reason\n\n* Urge to punch things randomly, but for fun, not out of anger\n\n**Increased creativity**\n\n====================\n\nHow this has impacted my life:\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been more sociable, more likable in a sense. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also been lashing out at people more, which is a negative. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost sleep and become unhealthier at the same time. I also tend to act on impulse, which has affected my social life both negatively and positively.\n\nOne time, on December 30th beginning in the early morning, a really scary and strange incident occurred. My dad called at around 1am asking when I was going to sleep and to be quiet. I could hardly speak, what came out was a garbled unintelligible mess. I spent about two hours listening to music and feeling \"high\"(my sort of strange high). Then this intense paranoia kicks in and I'm afraid to close my eyes, I brought out my knife, prepared to stab something, some sort of monster I was convinced was in my room. Then I locked myself in my bathroom. I spent nine minutes in there but it felt like an hour.Eventually I run out of the bathroom to eat part of a cold burrito, which I was obsessed with doing despite still being paranoid about the imaginary monster. My mom sees me, I ignore her and run back upstairs to lock myself in the bathroom. My dad comes upstairs banging on the door as I was far too loud. I then start yelling and run downstairs trying to clean things for some reason. I eventually freak out downstairs, pacing and knocking down chairs. Then I start crying like crazy and my mind is racing and I'm screaming. Then I calmed down, it was 5am. I went to sleep, and didn't wake up until 8pm. The scariest part was that everything I did and felt was involuntary, and a part of me was rational and questioning myself, but that was overpowered. This is one clear example of these ups negatively affecting my life.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost control and have developed a bad temper as well. Outbursts occur often, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control them. Once in an argument with my mom I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said some things I regret.\n\n====================\n\nDuration:\n\nGenerally lasts from a few hours to multiple days. Minimum of three hours and maximum of three weeks(ash?). First began in early December after a month of depression, continued for three weeks with a few hours of depression at random days in between.\n\n-------------------\n\nDowns:\n\n**Apathy**\n\n* Loss of interest in activities\n\n* Lack of motivation to do anything, really\n\n**Fatigue**\n\n* Even after getting plenty of sleep\n\n**Increased hunger and appetite**\n\n* Eating for the sake of eating, intense hunger\n\n**General feelings of hopelessness**\n\n* Feeling like things don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter, like nothing matters\n\n**Suicidal thoughts**\n\n* Self explanatory, wanting to die\n\n**Hatred for self**\n\n* Hating myself due to my inability to work well, constant cycle, falling deeper into well\n\n**Loss of energy**\n\nMost days I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to get out of bed, and hardly anything motivated me to do so. The thought of failing school was all that kept me going, but it only kept me from failing, not succeeding.\nFeelings and hope for nonexistence\n\nNot exactly suicidal, but some days I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to exist in the first place. \n\n====================\n\nHow this has impacted my life:\n\nThroughout the month of November I was depressed. The problem with this is it led to a downfall at school. As soon as I got home it was insanely difficult to push myself to do any work, and I mostly just ended up doing nothing for a few hours until I ate dinner and fell asleep, repeating the cycle again the next day. Because of this, in English I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keeping up with the weekly vocabulary work and reading a book we were supposed to read. When finals came around in early December I was unprepared, having only read around 10% of the book and studying 40% of the words. (Each week we received a new set of words and I stopped studying words as soon as the new ones came in. This ultimately led to me doing poorly on my English final. In my Japanese class I also slacked off, not completing work and so my teacher informed me that I would take the final when I returned after winter break. I also stopped talking with my parents, communication fell and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really want to see anybody.\n\n====================\n\nDuration:\n\nGenerally lasts from a few hours to a few days. Minimum of one hour and maximum of one month. First began in November, long period ended at the end of November and occurred randomly in December.\n\n-------------------\n\nMix:\n\nTwice this has happened. The two feelings above have collided twice. Once, on December 8. Below is an exact, unedited copy of what I wrote down that night at around 10PM, I ended up forcing myself to go downstairs and ask my dad to walk with me around the neighborhood, as I felt horrible.\n\n&gt;December 8\n\n&gt;December 8\n\n &gt;I am not okay\n\n\n&gt;Combining the two things I felt these past few months\n\n&gt;The depression and the mild insanity\n\n&gt;I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m filled with high energy but I want to calm down but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t and my mind is racing and I feel like screaming but I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\n\n&gt;I swear I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m at war with myself right now\n\n&gt;I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m isolating myself before I do something I will regret\n\n&gt;I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already slipped multiple times, filter for speech gone.\n\n&gt;I want to break stuff out of anger but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m laughing and happy and crying inside\n\n&gt;I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not okay\n\n&gt;I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m bouncing back and forth and I hate it\n\n&gt;I want to do so much but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hollow\n\n&gt;A THOUSAND EMOTIONS AT ONCE\n\n&gt;HELP\n\n&gt;NOTHING HELPS \t\t\n\n&gt;I m isolating myself from my family for tonight I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go downstairs I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m too unstable\n\nThe other time this happened I failed to record anything.\n\n--------------------\n\nTo Conclude:\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not the kind to self diagnose myself, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t overreact when it comes to medical problems, and most of the time I brush things off. But lately I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been searching around and researching what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m feeling. I came across a few interviews of Stephen Fry, where he describes mental illnesses, specifically bipolar disorder, and it explains exactly what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m feeling. I looked more into bipolar disorder and what people describe fits everything I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m feeling.\n\nMy mother told me that these feelings are normal during hard times, such as divorces. But I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so, this just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel right, even in my condition. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already gone through what I would consider to be normal emotions during hard times.\n\nMy father told me that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m fine, and it was just a clash of puberty and the hard times at home. I seriously doubt it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve experienced teenage hormones, and even though some parts of that match what I feel when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m up, including mood swings, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all very mild by comparison. After confessing to having had suicidal thoughts my dad has been working on scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist.\n\nIf anyone wants clarification or has questions on anything please ask.\n\nIf anyone has had similar experiences and would like to share please do, I really am scared and am in desperate need of answers.",

        "Origin_reddit": "A bit of background. There's this guy who I used to be great friends with in high school. Now we go to same college and we still have some of the same friends, but he's no longer in our main group of friends. \n\nI still talk to him from time to time, but we're not the \"talk everyday\" type of friends.\n\nI was bored on Reddit recently so I decided to check his profile because he posts his own music and some stupid (in a good way) jokes sometimes, and I wanted to check it out.\n\nI found his post here from a few weeks ago and I realized he broke up with his girlfriend, flunked a few classes, feels like he doesn't have anyone to talk to, and is really depressed h.\n\nHe didn't show up to a party we threw some time ago but we assumed that it was because of his grades. Now we found out he's going through issues.\n\nWe resolved to invite him to more stuff and reach out to him. We're also putting together a \"grades rehab crew\" to help tutor him next semester. What else can we do to help him through this?\n\nFor example, is it wise to ask people we know in his college block about the situation?\n\nDo we tell him we saw his post?\n\nI really wanna help my friend out. We would really appreciate your advice, reddit.\n\nHere's his post for some more info.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5i7ihl/fuck_this_semester/",
