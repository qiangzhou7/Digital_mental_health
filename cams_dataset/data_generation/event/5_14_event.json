And I remembered that all those years ago, music was life. For a brief moment, I remembered what it was like to feel. For real music, honest music, you have to be able to feel. I remembered that I would drift through the day back then so numb to the world, but when I got home, plugged up to the amp, and put on my 100 dollar studio quality headphones and magically I could feel. I wanted to remember that, so it's just what I did. Been a *long* time so I had to do some digging, and almost got stuck in the memories held by all the crap in storage, but I found it. The main volume dial needs to be replaced, and I had to rewire the speaker to the amp, but it all still works. And I played. Nothing fancy, just tuning, and some finger exercises, and other \"warmup\" stuff. I can't really remember how to play much else right now, but I did the thing, and it was great.

        "Origin_reddit": "Here we are again, in the middle of the night with nothing but the thoughts of failure, loneliness and fear of the future. I've been here so often over the last 10 years it feels like home. And has it really been 10 years? Unfortunately, yes. 10 years of depression. 10 years of anxiety issues interfering with my daily life. 5 Years out of high school and all I can count is the number of things I've fucked up. Dropped out of college. Been through 6 under-paid jobs that had me working 12 or more hours a day to exhaustion and panic attacks. That one really kills me. For the longest time panic attacks weren't something I had to worry about. I had maybe 3 from age 13 to 18. Then retail happened to me and I started having one a month. Then it turned into 1 a week. Then it turned into having problems leaving my house and jumping at the sound of a car starting. I suppose I've worked through part of that. I don't jump at everything anymore, and I managed to get out of the house some but being in public for any extended period of time still makes me nervous. I ran out of friends somewhere 2 years ago when I realized that my entire friend-group only hung around because I was a convenient source for weed and car rides. The last roomates I had were more my children than friends, since I had to constantly pick up after them to keep some organization in my living space, and constantly woke me up in the middle of the night bringing groups of drunk people over. I went straight after that. No drugs, no alcohol, no smoking. I still miss smoking. It gave me some amount of comfort in hard times, but you can't keep doing a thing that's killing you. Or so they say. I still have the urge to live, otherwise I would have kept the habit even when I started coughing up blood most mornings.\nBut the period of severe anxiety and depression before I did give up everything drained what meager savings I had accumulated. I was so afraid to leave the house that I quit my job, ordered delivery every day, and tried to drown my sorrows in alcohol and weed. There went 2k in a matter of months. What a waste. I could have bought into Bitcoin with that money. \nMy mom had recently moved back into the state. I had no idea until she showed up on my doorstep every other day when my phone service went out. She helped me get out of the shit house I was staying in, gave me a place to stay and food for the last month, but I can tell her patience is running thin. In the beginning it was all \"OMG let me help you!\" \"We'll take you to a therapist\". That lasted all of a week before it was on to the same drivel I got growing up about getting a job. Meanwhile, I can't get even get McDonald's to call me back anymore. -.- I don't really think I need to talk to a therapist. Drugs aren't going to improve my situation all that much. Getting a call back from even the lowest of the pizza delivery places around here would help. A lack of inflation driving school tuitions and hence my student loans sky high would help. But drugs? I doubt it. If the drugs that helped me decide to STOP doing drugs didn't help, then the one's to dull my mind and make me ok with slaving for 12 hours a day on a wage that won't pay for an apartment without room-mates sure as hell aren't. But that comes too close to playing the victim for comfort. I don't want to be a victim, I don't want sympathy, I just want to do something productive that makes me not feel like shit, and lets me afford my own space. Does that sound like too much to ask? Really, someone should tell me because from my POV it doesn't, but I may not be thinking in the clearest terms anymore. My experiences of the last 5 years certainly seem to point in this direction. But whatever the case may be, thanks for reading, if you have. It's a release of some sort to put my thoughts down on paper.",

My dad refuses to apologize for running out on us when I was 3 years old; my mother says he only picked me up twice from the time I was born until I could walk. \n\nMy first memory is of my older sisters begging me to eat my dinner because the sun was setting and we didn't have any power, and I had to eat so we could go to bed when darkness came. I was 3 at the time, and they were 12 and 9 years old, respectively. My dad repeatedly cheated on my mom while she was deployed overseas and spent weeks at a Motel 6 across town, leaving us to fend for ourselves, and we would have starved had my oldest sister not called the school and gotten one of her teachers to come give us groceries to hide from him. We were afraid to call the police because he might come back and beat us or worse. We were just kids, I don't know what else we could have done and it's in the past now so who cares. \n\nThe few times he did come back, he would take away the groceries we had and take all the money in my sister's piggy bank. \nOver the past decade my siblings and I have rolled through the years binging on drugs, buying from the internet and selling them to get my next high. My nephew was taken by CPS when my sister almost died from a week-long binge on meth. \n\nMy stepfather is an idiot but means well, and he's about the best I could ask for in a time like this, but as much as I try, I can't fill the void my dad left. He tries to talk to me now, but refuses to apologize or even acknowledge the terrible things he did. I don't think I can ever forgive him, and I don't know what to do.\nI don't want to go back to the drugs, but it would be so easy to run down to the supermarket and get a bottle of cough syrup for under 5 bucks to make me feel a little numb for a few hours. \n\nI tried to kill myself a month ago and spent 3 days in a psych ward which helped only in the way that I would do anything to get out of there, even lying about my mental state in order to get discharged as soon as possible. I've been prescriped antidepressants and xanax and i have a solid couple of best friends that I'm closer to than anyone in my family, but they're going back to college at the end of this winter break and I'll be stuck in my shitty hometown with no prospects for the future.\nI worked as an EMT for a few months after getting my certification about a year ago, but I saw some shit that still haunts me every night.\n\nI don't know what to do, where to turn, or who can help me. The suicide hotline tells me that they have to move on to another caller after 10 minutes of talking and I don't want to give them my address or they'll call the police like last time.

My parents had come over to help me clean on Saturday and I had a headache so I could do little to help, but I tried my best. Tylenol didn't work. My dad ended up getting upset that there's \"always something wrong with me.\" He also said a bunch of other bullshit stuff about depression after I had to remind him what I'm dealing with and why I am physically not well at the moment. Ended up locking myself in the bathroom, my cat worrying outside, until they left.\n\nMy mom texted me later that she had a talk with him that depression affects everyone differently, and he needs to be more understanding. I explained a little more about my dismal sleeping and eating habits, and clarifying my seemingly growing problems. Fine, we're good. Still pissed because he comes off as very heartless when it comes to depression. He's never been there himself, but my mom has, obviously I have, and their other kid (who I do not associate with for unrelated reasons) also has.\n\nToday my mom came by again, and she keeps going on about \"why don't I do x or y\" and I explain that everything feels like it's lost meaning in all of this. \n\nAnd then she pulls the most bullshit line. Again. I have called her out so many times over the last almost 6 years, and I just don't understand how she can still say shit like this after having dealt with depression herself.\n\n\"Don't be depressed, you just have to think positive.\"\n\nFucking wish i'da thought of that 6 years ago.

The prospects of getting rid of loneliness are weak as long they are alone.\n\nThe only person who is obsessed with death is the only one who has a chance to get away from loneliness and to survive as long as he has spent time there.

I've never before taken steps towards self care so that in itself is an accomplishment and I'm proud of it. Will I be back to my self destructive and self pitying ways soon? Who knows, but for just one day I'm going to allow myself to take care of me and if you've been looking for any encouragement or a sign to do the same then hopefully this is it. I've decided nobody gives a shit that you're laying in bed crying and the only person who can make me happy is myself if I just allow myself to enjoy things. Instead of purposely listening to that sad music when I'm already sad, I'm going to listen to my dumb 70's upbeat playlist.\n\n\nToday is no different than any other day except for the fact that society deems it the start of a new year when in reality time is just a construct. The idea that you need to be around other people on NYE in order to have fun is also another construct. The sun will still set and rise like it does everyday.\n\n\nIf you give in to looking at social media you will see people getting drunk and what appears to be having fun. Realize that yes, some of these people are genuinely out having a good time, but a majority of it is making things appear better than they really are. They're not posting pictures of people sitting on a chair scrolling through their phones (which is what happens for 90% of the time at the majority of parties), they're posting pictures where everyone came together and posed like they're having fun and shit is wild and right after the camera shutter goes off they're back to scrolling on their phones. Some of them are probably feeling fed up and wishing it was over. Some of them probably feel just as alone as they do when there's nobody around (and that's truly a worse feeling). I know this was true back when I used to get invited to parties. You, on the other hand, are at home surrounded by things you can enjoy. Movies, TV, video games, books, hobbies like drawing, you name it. Would you really be happier at that party?\n\n\nAnyway, I'm going to wrap this post up because, like I said, I have a day of fun shit to do by myself. If you're not ready to take the step towards self care, I get it. I've been depressed for a hell of a long time and never taken this step. But today I woke up and decided to do it. It'll happen for you eventually if it's not happening now. Happy NYE guys.\n\n\n\nMy plan as well as tips for tonight:\n\n\n- Starting off eating a nice pot brownie that I've been saving (Also for the first time, I'm getting high because it's enjoyable, not as an escape)\n\n\n- Watch a movie (Never seen The Wolf of Wall Street and I think I'm going to try it out tonight)\n\n\n- Watch TV shows (I've been watching The Office lately)\n\n\n- Play a video game (I've been into Battlefield 1 and Civ 6 lately)\n\n\n- Depending on how high I get, watch Planet Earth (On a more serious note, shit puts things into perspective and reminds you how fucking cool the planet where we live is. People might suck sometimes, but nature is beautiful as fuck. The colors and scenery are amazing but I'll probably be high as shit crying when I see the predator killed the prey only to bring the food back to its own babies)\n\n\n- Fireworks get to me pretty badly, so if they get loud I'm going to put headphones in\n\n\n- Limit social media use (I know I won't be able to stop myself from checking, so I'll just remind myself of what I typed earlier when I do)\n\n\n- Eat good food (Try making something new or order out your favorite food)\n\n\n- Give my dog a hug and a treat at midnight\n\n\n- Get a good rest and wake up tomorrow like I do everyday\n\nI advise you to make a list like I did and if at any point you feel yourself drifting into self pity or whatever else, try to read it and do something on it to get you back on track to a good night :)",

I've always been very happy and content knowing that I would live, and die, alone. Until now. Now I can't stand the idea of being alone.

And as much as I appreciate my own company, it would be nice to have someone who values me as much as I do. \n\nThat might come off as egotistical, but hey I'm a human being and yeah I have an ego. \n\nSometimes I still need someone to take care of me, and I feel like I'm coming up short. \nI could really use a companion right about now. Some one to let me know that it truly is worth it to try to be the best version of myself. \nSomeone more than my mom and my mirror. \n\nIf you're alone tonight, I might be too. So let's maybe not be alone? ",

It's birthday depression all over again. Laying around knowing that it's another year and I'm not in a better position that I was in last year, and I genuinely dislike so much about myself. I'm stuck here, feeling miserable, and knowing I have to go out tonight and be social so I don't end up sitting here alone, probably drinking by myself and inevitably hurting myself. Fuck. Whatever. This is obnoxious and I just needed to vent. We'll get through this bullshit. It's just another day. Fuck.",
