I don't deserve this. Maybe it's caused by childhood trauma, maybe it's genetics, maybe it's just shit luck, I don't know for sure, but I sure as hell didn't ask to be plagued with social anxiety and depression; I won't allow 2016 and how shitty it was to kill me. Yes, I became suicidal a month into it, yes I hated myself for most of the year and used self-deprecating humor to express how I felt, yes I started self-harming and cutting myself over the summer and did it more or less regularly for the rest of the year, yes my anxiety reached new heights and started interfering with my life and career, but what do I say to that? I'M FUCKING DONE. I have done nothing to deserve this. I've done some regrettable things in my life, but nothing so bad that would make suicide a justifiable decision. I want to taste happiness and \"feeling okay\" for once--and not just that, but for a long time; I know I'm naturally prone to feeling depressed and like shit, but that doesn't mean I need to accept it. Even if I'm going to die, it doesn't need to be by my own hand, at the end of a gun barrel pressed against the side of my skull. I want to have a successful and flourishing career, I want to have fun in my 20s's, I want to experience all that is, I want to fall in love. Deep inside my head, there's still that part of me who wants to sabotage everything I strive for, who wants me to kill myself, who picks up the knife and cuts myself, who tells me I'm an unattractive piece of shit who should die. Fuck that guy. I will not go gentle into that good night. I will rage, rage against the dying of the light. I will make 2017 my bitch.",

I'd need to PRIORITIZE THEM over my own life. That's completely horrifying to me.\n\nShe's left. I'm right.\n\nI drive her nuts all the time. I can't make her happy when she's sad.\n\nI enjoy living a lazy, quiet lifestyle living off of SSI. I can't provide for a significant other.\n\nI should be happy like this. I should be overjoyed. This way our bond won't be ruined when we inevitably couldn't stand each other any more and have an ugly breakup. \n\nSo, why am I not? I can shrug off most rejections with \"she was too good for me, anyway\", leave it at that, and move on with my life.\n\nSo why am I not feeling any better when I can come up with a million more reasons why it would never work out in a million years? I know it's for the best. I've accepted it won't change. But it doesn't get better. It still hurts. And I never thought it would ever happen. My entire life I thought I was immune to this, because I never considered myself capable of falling in love in the first place.\n\nBut, here I am. And I still don't know how the fuck I ended up here. I still don't know why what happened happened. All I know is that I regret it ever happened. I wish I could go back in time and restrain myself and remind myself of the life I wanted to have, and not get this close.\n\nBut I didn't listen to myself. I foolishly let it happen, thinking it was fine. Never imagining it could come back to bite me later. But it did. I got too close. It got too serious. And now there's hell to pay. I have to carry this weight around for years. At the bare minimum. With therapy. And pills that don't work for jack shit. I may be like this forever. Some say it never truly gets better. It may not hurt as bad. But it's always going to hurt to some extent. And I don't believe people who say it'll pass. I think I'm damaged forever. And it's all because I was too goddamn naive to consider what might happen.\n\nIs this the real reason why major lifestyle differences are such an immediate turn off and cause to break contact for most? Once political views and beliefs and values stop being a barrier, EVERYTHING does. It gets to the point where you want to stand by someone no matter how rotten they become. What vile things they do. Because you're used to doing it. Because you believe it's the right thing to do. And you won't listen if anyone tells you otherwise. It's the cruelest joke in the world- because you find yourself so obsessed and committed, and willing to do anything at all for someone, you can't stop loving them and move on, literally no matter WHAT happens. I could not have less in common with her if I tried. And yet, here I am. Hopelessly in love with someone who is never going to love me back. \n\nI never want to get this close to someone. Ever again. I don't want to feel pain and shock fresh ever again. I don't want to carry any more burdens around. The fact of the matter is, there's probably only one person in the world I was willing to consider breaking my dreams of living the free single life for. And she's not interested. All that's left for me is the idea and possibility of a life that I always wanted to live. And it doesn't make me happy. I'd give it all up for her in a heartbeat if I could.\n\nLuckily for me, I have surefire female repellent, as if my very existence in and of itself wasn't enough of it. Apparently those of the female race think very lowly of men who pay for sex and want nothing to do with them, and certainly won't date them.\n\nWell, screw 'em. If they don't want to give it to me, I am going to pay for it, in places where it's legal to do so. And then it'll be a damn sure thing I'll never find someone who wants me. Because I am going to tell ANYBODY who gets too close to me what I did. And then they'll make faces and run. I refuse to lie. How can you possibly love someone you're lying to and keeping secrets from? The entire relationship has a rocky foundation waiting to crumble if word ever surfaces. That's why I find it impossible to approach women. How am I supposed to say \"Hello, I am interested in you purely for your body\" and expect it to go over well? Because that's all you know about a girl at first glance. It's the only thing you COULD be interested in. But you can't say that. But lying is bad. And thus... the eternal dilemma. \n\nI should be happy. I get to live the life I always wanted to have. Going off to have legal sex with prostitutes. Doing whatever I want without any extra baggage to worry about. Knowing it all ultimately doesn't mean anything. It only does for a night. I should be overjoyed. My dreams will soon become a reality.\n\nBut I'm not happy. Because it's not what I truly want.\n\nI can't have what I want. It's all merely settling for what I can have. Almost nobody gets to have what they truly want out of life. Even if what they want isn't something atrocious. But maybe it was an atrocious idea all along. Unconditional love doesn't truly exist, and I'm a warped human being who wants to believe it does.\n\nI hope they legalize prostitution in the rest of America, besides Vegas. Maybe this never would have happened if there was just a more accessible place you could go to turn in your virgin card once you hit 18. Maybe I'd have been satisfied with meaningless one night stands with women sooner. Maybe I would have been spared all of this heartbreak and pain, and maybe I never would have gotten as close as I did.\n\nBut maybe I was going to anyway. Maybe it was always going to happen, regardless of if I wanted it or not. Maybe it was fate. Maybe fate really exists.\n\nOr maybe none of this actually matters.\n\nFirst day of 2017 and I already hate my life and everything.\n\nYay.",

I had a great time before the party. I had pre-drinks with a couple of mates and it was chill, I felt calm and like myself. I should mention that last month I was dumped and cheated on during a long distance relationship that last 7-Months so the girl I'm about to talk about is the first girl I've had feelings for since. Towards the party I wanted to talk to my crush who was invited. We've been friends for a couple of years and in the past month I've invited her to a movie and surprised her with coffee before Christmas. I've been warming up to asking her on a proper date but when the party started. I relapsed. I've been feeling great up to this point. I shut down, I was a shell the whole night. She was surrounded by guys all the time and I didn't even get to say hello let alone have enough courage to. I was isolating myself for most of the night, even when it's my own party. Friend's comforted me and wanted to help but I just shut them out. The countdown to 2017 came and I left to my garage. I didn't want to see anyone. People left around 1:30am and I said goodbye acting really appreciative that they came. I'm happy they came but not during the night, I just wanted to be alone. The next day I apologize for not talking and just let out my feelings for her. She just thanked me for the night and ignored what I said about her. Now my day is ruined because I overthink. \n\ntldr; Had a party, relapsed back into my old state and didn't talk to my crush. I talked to said crush and she doesn't necessarily care how I feel.",

If you truly fallen in love someone, not just by their physical appearance, it definitely is not something you can simply move on. I have known this girl for 8 years and i am so deeply in love with her, but i know she would never love me back. I consider her my closet friend but i know she does not. I know if i disappear she would not care. We talk almost everyday, play video games, and from time to time hang out as a group, but i know these things mean nothing to her other than a social outlet. The amount of things i have done for her, be there for her when her pet of 13 years passed away, be there when no one else would, go out of my way to help her studies, travel overseas after having a surgery just because she told me she wanted someone to hang out with, all those things i know meant nothing to her. I know that if someone doesn't love you, no matter what you do they won't, I am not spiteful about her not loving me back, i know she owes me nothing but it just hurts so much. She is the first person in my life that when she felt sad, i would feel sad as well, when she is happy, i would be happy. She is by no means amazing looking, but every time i look at her, i would see the most beautiful girl i have seen in my life. I can just spend the whole day looking at her, i can't even imagine loving any other girl other than her. I know she has some personal flaws, but no matter how annoying they are, i still love her the same. The thought of new years have made this experience even worse than it is. No matter how i try to play out a scenario of me confessing to her just to get rejected a move on, it would end in our friendship ending. I love her so much i rather suffer than not have her at all.

But sometimes he does really reckless shit that I don't know how to react to in a helpful, supportive way. Specifically, tonight (NYE) he went and got suuuper drunk with some friends and wound up eating a bunch of vitamins and then forcing himself to throw up. I know this because after Danny sent me about a dozen completely unintelligible texts, one of his friends took his phone and messaged me to tell me what was up and reassure me that he was okay.\n\nMy knee jerk reaction was anger - that he would drink so much when he knows he's not supposed to mix alcohol with his medication, and that he would do something so reckless. I mean, I don't know how dangerous eating a handful of vitamins actually is, but I've heard it's bad and so has he. And he's been very suicidal before, before I met him, so the general behavior just scares me.

I was incredibly lonely, spending my days sleeping and staring into a screen.\n\nThis year gave me hope though, I met the most amazing girl imaginable - intelligent, funny, sweet/kind, romantic, sexy, same interests, everything I've ever wanted. She was the first girl I've ever dated, someone who actually saw me as something other than the ugly, awkward guy. I actually planned to kill myself around that time, but it all went away after that. I was the happiest guy in the world. \n\nThat all changed though after she suddenly attempted suicide a few weeks ago. Now all she does is push me away when I try to be there for her (going as far as to dump me) and refuses to see anything beside the negative no matter how much I try to reassure her. She's like an entirely different person now, definitely not the same girl that told me she loved me every night. Meanwhile, I'm even worse than I was before. \n\nIt's already enough that depression ruined *my* life, but now it's destroying the person dearest to me and there's nothing I can do to stop it.

When I was a kid I was tortured by my entire school. I've been suicidal since I was 12, struggling with addiction since 14 and I am now 23. I've lived my life in a giving manner. Always making sacrifices to help others. I have been feeling lately that I have dug myself too deep to get out. Shit really started to go down hill when I was 17. I was in a happy loving relationship with a girl. It was fantastic we were best friends and shared everything. However she was 2 years younger than me and when I turned 18 her parents called the police. I did 180 days in jail I'm a registered sex offender until I'm 33 and on probation until next February. A little while after I turned 19 I feel in love again with a girl who I had a crush on since the ninth grade. We had a daughter I turned my life around I quit using and for a short period I didn't hate myself anymore I didn't even want to die. God I miss that. I worked nights slept a couple hours and watched my daughter all day while my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 was at work while going to school online and managing all of our responsibilities. She left and took my daughter away just before thanksgiving just out of the blue. I tried to get her back. I fought I did everything in my power to get her back but she will not listen. I just want my family back but that will never happen. So tonight I will jump off a bridge into the Mississippi River. I'm done with all of this every time I try to dig myself out I dig the hole deeper. I just wanted to tell someone before I jump to get all of this off my chest and not feel so full of anxiety so I can live my last day with my daughter peacefully. Thanks for all of the laughs and dungeon ideas Reddit hope you all do better than I did. ",

I got depressed and I'm on antidepressants. I also got pretty sick, some significant limitations, surgery was on the table, still might be, but hopefully not. Also, I had the worst phases of tinnitus in my life recently and it drove me insane. I have 2 favorite hobbies that I need my right hand for, but I got a nasty inflammation in my right hand, so I can't do my favorite hobbies. I lost a solid 35 pounds in 4 months because of depression. I felt better recently after being on antidepressants, found a girl that I like a lot and we had a trip planned, long distance relationship. I was looking forward to it for a long time, but I got sick again today and had to cancel and since this was the week when she had time off from work, God knows when there'll be time again. I also worry that I will lose her for some reason now, being pathetic as I am atm. And I feel like that was the last drop. I sincerely don't feel like going on after all of this, there is just no point in anything anymore. I'm so disappointed by getting sick again after struggling with health so much lately. Disappointed by not getting to spent intimate time with this girl again. I spent a month in bed just now and I'm already sick again. Wife started pushing hard for divorce on Christmas eve of all days (we were keeping this for when things calm down a bit, as it's just a formality to us at this point). Today she visited my parents and went full passive-aggressive on me, brought back bad flashbacks. My mom, who's my closest person in all of this... we have a slightly complicated relationship. She's kind of a low key feminist and she has a tendency to take my ex's side by default, identifying with her as she is also a divorced woman and she never entirely dealt with that. She was pretty cold today in communication with me after my ex's visit today and it got to me. And I apparently can't sleep, so I took sleeping pills and I'm starting to feel super sleepy as I'm typing this. Also, I noticed I suffer from forgetfulness and have trouble concentrating or falling asleep after starting to take antidepressants, which scares me. Overall, I'm just not sure anymore. The only positives in my life atm are my mom's support and being able to look forward to spending time with this girl and both things just went out the window and I feel like... what's the point in going on? IDK if there is any, IDK. I have to stop typing now as the sleeping pills are taking over, but just believe me when I say that this isn't even close to everything that has brought me into depression, it was just an awful year for me in many ways. Even with antidepressants and therapy, it's all too much now. Way too much. I find my self thinking over and over again that I don't want to have to do this anymore, I just wanna die. I can't get hospitalized or anything like that for this depression, as I need to financially support myself, my kid and my ex, since I'm the only one making money and I don't have anybody in my environment who could support me in any way in this regard. I just don't want to anymore. I wish I could get 3 or 4 good days, just a break and have things go well for a change. But I've been wishing for that since a long time and yet, here I am.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nEDIT: I also suffer from burn-out syndrome after years of working too hard and I've had depression and anxiety in the past.",

Over the past few years, my mother's mental health has deteriorated drastically to the point of suicidal.  It is now at the lowest point and she has tried multiple times to commit suicide.  She had health insurance for when she had her double mastectomy early in 2016 but my father quit paying for it.  If she had health insurance, the doctor said she would have been put straight into inpatient care but instead she was urged to go to outpatient.  This is just not a possibility with her at this moment.  There is no way she is capable of going to get help herself and I do not know what else I can do.  I do not have much money as I am currently a college student.  I do not know exactly what are my options to try and get her some help and it has been difficult finding the right path to get her some help.  If anyone knows of a way to get some low cost options or even just a general direction for me to look, it would be much appreciated.  I am really struggling here because I can not give her the full time care she needs to get better.  Thank you for listening and have a Happy New Year.",

I was already hangry, had made myself some chicken in the oven, but set the heat too low, so it came out frozen. I was fumed and was ready to cry because I was so hungry and just really wanted some ramen. And, because all we've been doing this weekend is going to parties, we didn't have food at home. \n\nMy mom was really annoyed that I was sulking and she asked me why I was feeling the way I was feeling. I just told her that I felt I was a 5 year old that wasn't getting their favourite food for dinner and that I'll be fine after I finish being sad. And then she said \"well maybe if you stopped sulking so much you wouldn't have depression.\" after that I told her to fuck off and that what she said was an insensitive thing to say to anyone who was depressed and that she was lucky I'm not suicidal. \n\nI'm trying to let go of this situation now. Trying to cheer myself up by watching some Graham Norton, which usually works, but now there's this huge tightness in my chest and I can't breathe properly.\n\nMy mom has always been, and for as long as she doesn't open her mind up a little bit, she will always be the most frustrating person to talk to about my depression.
