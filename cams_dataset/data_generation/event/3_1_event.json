I have lots of friends. I have a good job lined up and am doing very well at university. This track sends out lots of positive emotions and appreciates life.\n\nBut for the last 2 years theres another track that CONSTANTLY talks about how every single thing is meaningless. A gorgeous sunset? Life is meaningless, there is no purpose to anything. Having a good time with friends? Life is meaningless. The best way that I ccould describe it is like a stone lodged in your shoe that you have no way to remove, and you have to go on a 50 mile hike.\n\nWell I've had enough. There have been times when I have a respite and I feel normal. But they last a couple hours, a couple days at max.\n\nI don't htink I have depression since I think a lot of positive things often, am not socially isolated or anything like that. In fact when I read the stories of people who are depressed or anxious I ENVY them. Because they seem to be upset about something concrete. Like they feel inadequate. They are scared what others will think of them. They are scared of things IN THE REAL WORLD. But whatever is bogging down is so frightening because there is no concrete root. I couldn't care less what people think of me. There's nothing in the real world that totally takes over my mind, because no matter WHAT i am thinking about, always what is playing in the back of my head is \"this is pointless, this is pointless, this is pointless...\"\n\nBut clearly there is something very chemically wrong with my brain and I just cannot take it anymore.

        "Origin_reddit": "I am terrified.\n\nI am terrified because something inside of me is broken. Even as I write this, I am overwhelmed, because it Is impossible to describe it. I do not know how to describe it. The closest thing to it is hell. It is a state when all of your worst fears come to life. When your paranoia is palpable in the air. \n\nIt is the place, when you were a child, that you could never even conceive of. Perhaps when you had a momentary glimpse of it in your bad dreams at night, but then you woke up.  Now that you are older, you live in it.  Your life is literally a nightmare.\n\nMy mind has taken everything away from me. The bipolar disorder which came unto me in early adulthood destroyed my life. It took away all of my relationships and capacity to have relationships. It took away all of my hopes and dreams. It ruined my reputation and took away any career prospects.  The idea of being homeless, discarded, abandoned and left to rot is a very real thing that is facing me. There is no bottom. Even when you reach it, you just keep pushing yourself further down, wallowing in your own guilt. The only real support I have left are my parents, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know for how much longer. I have caused them so much stress already. I have caused them to worry so much- how can one live with so many weights to bear on top of their original insanity?\n\nI am in a place where everything Is dark. With feelings of inner death and hopelessness that make you want to crawl into a corner and cry.  The worst of it is the confusion. Knowing that you have tried everything, that nothing worked, and so you have no idea what you are even supposed to do anymore in life. Everything contradicts itself. Everything is a double-bind. Everything feels like a dead end, and every step forward feels like a step back.  So, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re stuck. Worse still, you have no one to blame but yourself, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you do, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s of no use either.\n\nSo you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become an expert in patience and endurance. You endure the shitstorm that is your reality. You grin and bear it, hoping it make it through another day.  You wonder how is it possible for a sentient being to be able to experience something so terrifying and painful. You also wonder what you did to deserve this- and if karma is real, then yeah, you deserve it.  There you are at it again- breaking yourself in, harder and harder.  Non-stop negativity, hostile and intrusive thoughts.  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be around others because it makes no sense. How could they be normal, have a sincere smile, and you are like this? It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compute- it just hurts you more and makes you feel even more lonely.  So you live alone and isolated, and you wait it out. Minutes turn into hours, turn into days, turn into weeks, turn into months, turn into years.  Year after year goes by, and you experience some periods of normalcy or perhaps even joy, some success, but then as surely as the seasons alternate, your depression comes back stronger than ever as if on cue, and takes away any progress you have made.  It destroys any newfound hope you were able to cultivate and nurture.  It makes you once again cut off all ties, run away, and there you are again, once again cowering in your own little corner, your personal hell.\n\nYou hear all the naive New-Agers say \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust go for it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccarpe diem\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou only live once!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou always have the choice to be happy\u00e2\u0080\u009d \"you can always turn your life around\"\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and you know, it just breaks my mind even more.  They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand, and you cannot make them understand, that this is not how it works, not for you. No, I am not some victimized snowflake, but there is something broken in my brain, in my soul. Some of the buttons, some of the options you have, for me, they are disabled. I do not have these same options, and no, it is not just because I believe that. I could live in delusion and convince myself otherwise, but it would change nothing.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just fucking doomed like this, you see?   Yes of course, that makes me the toxic negative person, as if I enjoyed it. Rest assured, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  Oh and by the way, earlier on, I was able to turn my life around. I called on the help of some divine and holy miracle and relentless self-discipline and truly did turn my life around, but in the end, it never lasts. It always, without exception, gets taken away. Now, I am no longer able to call in the supernatural, the impossible. I can no longer will myself. \n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that we experience that most people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Perhaps they have had brief periods of hell, but not for as long as we do.  Every moment, I wish I were dead. I cannot kill myself for the typical reasons- it will hurt others and maybe, just maybe, there could be hope for something better one day, even though it may be inconceivable now.   \n\nPersonally, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really looking forward to the day of my death. Why? So that when I have my life review, I can finally know WHY?  Why all this pain, why all this suffering, for what?  I can look my guardian angel in the eye without any regrets and tell him: \u00e2\u0080\u009clook motherfucker, I did the best I could. I tried everything. There was absolutely nothing more I could do. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you fucking dare tell me I could have been more \u00e2\u0080\u009copen\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cloving\u00e2\u0080\u009d. I tore my heart out to find my inner love, but there was none\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nSo then by whatever process, I would be made to know, to understand why, and I hope to God that if reincarnation is real, that my next lifetime could be normal and joyous.   So far as I can see it, I do not feel that this kind of pain and suffering could be anything other than a) a punishment or b) a test of endurance. I can say with complete confidence that I have not learned or benefited in any way from my bipolar disorder. If anything, it has caused and continues to cause harm to myself and all those around me, and the worst of it is that there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.    Happy new year.",

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to back up and let everyone understand.\n\n  When I was about 1 year old my father obtained full custody of me. I rarely seen my mother. Once in elementary school she came around once a month. My dad was always hauling me around. Pretty much raised me just fine as a single father. He got married when I was 12 and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an alcoholic who is also a feminist. She was just that, a person married to my father. About 16 years old, towards the end I ended up getting a girl I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been in a relationship with for a year pregnant. I attempted suicide as all I have done in my life is alcohol and drugs. Very foolish and ignorant and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand life. (I get it, selfish or whatever roast me later.) \n  We split because she had a very dark personality. She eventually got addicted to heroin. Which leads to my next venture at 18-20. I met a girl who was supposed to be a one night stand. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have barely held a job and was completely irresponsible. We had shared parenting of my oldest son. I was also in school and decided I wanted to be a firefighter. I took my EMT class and got a job working on an ambulance. She accidentally got pregnant with me because of a failed nuvaring.She was very controlling of me and which I hated the feeling of being controlled. As I had been a free spirit for pretty my entire life. I was staying at home by myself since I was about 6 years old.\n  I ended up cheating on her when he was about 8 months old.Ew ah, bad guy. Immaturity at its complete and utter finest.  Understood. But wait there is more! I woke up late for work which I should\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been there at 4 a.m after I got home at around midnight from college classes. I lost my job and ended up failing my paramedic class by about .5% which meant I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go forward. So, I dropped out of college and lost my job. My parents let me move back in with them. I worked at papa johns just for a little money. Then came the first child support order. \n  Making barely 500$ every two weeks as a manager they decided to hit me as hard as they could with $200 a month. Not too bad but I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to live on my own. *queue sappy music* I decided to get back into working on the ambulance. I was disgusted of not making enough to live on my own. I took out about 20k student loans as well to buy the ex and nice 4.5k explorer. As well made sure we had everything we needed. As well as a car for me! Debt debt debt. I made less money working on the ambulance coming in at a whopping 8.57$ an hour. I worked about 80-120 hours a week. Straight 24\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day after day. I found different girls to be with because I still couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to live because I only made around 1,200$ a month. We then found out my ex was addicted to heroin. We had shared parenting so the only way to remove the order without lawyer fees was to give my parents temporary custody.\n  Alright, so at this point you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably like damn it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get that bad. As Billie mays says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut wait there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Oh boy I reflect on life a bunch. I accrued 3 credit cards which are completely maxed. Heheheh. So on the with story, I met a few different girls and they all had decent jobs which let me have my own place to stay. (Crowd yells:gold digger!!) It was at this time I decided the current girl was not cutting what I needed. Boom, break up with her, at the same time I found a new ambulance job which gave me a 1.50ish raise. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll yeah. So at this point I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any custody of my 2 kids and my parents were so gracious to take a child support order on me. (Since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m making money, ya know 8.57$ an hour.) broke up with her and 3 weeks later she calls me to tell me she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pregnant.(oh god dude you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t learned your lesson.) ((I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m 23 at this time.)) \n\n  I said I have nothing with my first two kids and barely see them. I work for nothing and I think the best option would be abortion or adoption. Around the same time I got that new job guess what? Child support claimed I made 15$ an hour and raised my child support to all intensive purposes to about 485$. My other order was recalculated at 8.57$ less than two weeks later as well saying the first order was at 200$. So the girl hits me with the, literally, fuck you pay me.\n\n  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice. I said screw it major life change. I need it, something. I found my girlfriend through a friend on Xbox live, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the freaking odds? I worked on an ambulance but they would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken half of every check which made the 15$ a day render pointless as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d only be making enough to go back and forth to work. Well, of course I get a massive 315$ order. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re up to 1100$ ish a month on barely above minimum wage. Now, did contracting work for my dad because I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make any money no matter what to pay bills. Hey, arrears!! You said fuck your kids so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to fuck you!! Oh.. is that what happened.. I found a blessing of a job making 18$ an hour. Not doing my career because I cannot afford it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working overtime since 18. Practically killing myself to make ends meet. I am now forced to work on the road. I have to work overtime if I want to pay bills and eat food. Even then I still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make enough. I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t paid any debt off. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m about 28 grand in debt. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had both my 2 kids taken from me. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a car for 6 months so I had to borrow my dads truck which he took back. My co-worker sold me a car for 500$. Good guy. \n\n  Now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here. Today, almost the start of a new year. Everything, anything, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever cared about has been taken from me. My kids. My career. My money. My life. My girlfriend gets mad at me because I can be insecure. What she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see is I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m holding on.. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid to lose anything else.. not afraid.. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost motivation. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found god. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gained motivation. Spurts. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m strong. I have to be. At 24 I act like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m 45. Maybe 55 because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tired. I work 40 hours of overtime 7 am-11pm of hard labor when there is work. Most of the time there is not. So average of 40 hours. If I get a second job I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get jumped by child support. Already happened. Seen a counselor to try getting prescribed adderall because my body is falling apart. My mind is blank. My thought process is almost gone. I can barely do the dishes correctly. My mother has taken herself away from me. My children have been taken away. He said I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m strong not depressed. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even afford healthcare. I make too much as a \u00e2\u0080\u009csingle guy\u00e2\u0080\u009d to get Medicaid or the food card. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get legal aid. I owe tax money too because I claim 2 for 1 person. They are trying to take my tax return that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist either. \n\nSigh, just wanted to vent. Happy New Years.",

I am 20 years old male, with a previous history of OCD(Fear of getting a heroin addict.), but I can't tell if it is the same or worse. It is horrific. Here is what happens. After I read the news, in my head went something like 'If he can do it, then why shouldn't I?' And I started having intrusive suicidal thoughts, I will give an example:\n\n-A friend: Lets go and drink a coffe tomorrow.\n\n-Me: Okay\n\n-My mind: If I don't suicide by then.\n\nSo basically at the begining (the first few hours) It was terrifying, but I was unaware what is going to happen after this.\n\nSo I got pretty paniced and googled: 'intrusive suicidal thoughts' and major depessive disorder or OCD showed up. I entered both web pages and both said '10 times higher chance of commiting suicide.'\n\nThis was the moment when everything fell appart.\n\nThis was the moment when I felt this rapid change in my mind.\n\nThis was the moment in which I felt like a part of me changed into something horrific.(Okay this was too much movie like sentence, but anyway.)\n\nSo basically my life is pretty rough since then I will try to be as accurate as possible, I have days in which I feel relatively normal. So, here are the things happening in my head and body. Some of them are constant, some of them are not.\n\nIntrusive suicidal thoughts which feel real. I really hope they are intrusive, and not true Suicide Ideation. With a confusion If I want them or not. Which is terrifying.\n\nKnot in the stomach.\n\nWhenever I look online for something to buy, there is a feeling like 'There is no point I won't be here soon' and a knot in the stomach.\n\nFeeling like I can't do anything fun, like can't relax I don't know how to describe it.\n\nLess interest in people.\n\nLess apetite.\n\nSudden feeling of tiredness sometimes.\n\nNearly constant, uneasiness.\n\nScary feeling, when I imagine my life without these thoughts, it feels like kind of boring?! I don't know it this is the right word.\n\nFeeling on the edge, feeling like my life is shortened, like I will do something bad soon.\n\nRandom feeling of life being pointless without a reason with a variating duration.\n\nRandom TERRIFYING Intese feeling like trapped in life.\n\nRandom feeling that I need to escape, but there is no place to.\n\nWhen I am feeling bad, there are constant thoughts, random things I have read on google reddit, with a pictures of the article I was reading.\n\nI stopped working, and now I feel like If I work or feel overwhelmed I will do it.\n\nI stopped University becausw of it, and because I didn't find it interesting.(I made a mistake with chosing my subject.\n\nIntrusive unsettling feeling real scenarious in which my best friend tell me If I want to work with him.(We had a pretty sucessful store.\n\nFeeling like I don't want to admit that I am suicidal?!\n\nFeeling like I don't want to get better?!? I tried finding a reason, but I can't think a reason why, like I stop thinking when I try.\n\nFear that I developed these thoughts, a few days before Chester's thing, and I try to see my chats to see if there are some signs, but it is impossible to be sure.(This is not a big deal, but I am trying to be as accurate as possible.)\n\nAt first I thought this is depression, however I don't show many signs of depression. Then I thought it is Anxiety, but It feels darker and realer than Anxiety.\n\nWeird negative feeling when babies arround.\n\nRandom feeling like everything I see is too much?\n\nFear/Feeling like this is something unknown, incurable and it is impossible to feel like before.\n\n**Now on new year everyone is wishing \"many years\" and it triggers anxiety everytime like i don't want it?!?

This is what happens: life feels meaningless with a weird image stuck in the back of my head feeling, like future idk, feeling of unrasiness, unsettled feeling, negative scenarious, I try to calm myself with a positive thoughts, I succeed for like a second, then it feels like the negative thoughts, reinforce themselfs and become more and more intense, then I am like 'If i feel like i will do something i will go to the hospital, chill., then like 'it doesn't matter you feel trapped' and it becomes even more intense and more intense uneasiness feeling, i close my eyes laying in my bed, almost starting to feel normal for a couple of seconds, then i open my eyes and everything in my head is intense again, i try again to counter them, it becomes even more intense.\n\nI have several questions:\n\nWhat does it look like?\n\nDoes it look like actual suicide ideation/suicidality?\n\nDo I sound suicidal? I am so confused\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",

These symptoms are consistent with suicide ideation and may indicate a higher risk of suicide.\n\nIt is important to note that the writer is unsure if these feelings are intrusive or true suicide ideation, which can make it difficult to determine the appropriate course of action.

I go out a few times every week to get groceries, but only at night when I have an easier time walking with less traffic and people inside the store.  That's the extent of my real human interaction. \"Hi, thanks, have a good day\".\n\nI'm too frightened to make many changes to my life, even though I desperately need to.  Two years ago I tackled my drinking problem, that's solved and lost a bunch of weight. I figured i'd try and improve myself, do what I could first before asking for help.\nI went crazy for a bit and threw out old stuff i'd been saving, like probably half of what I owned. My house has no furniture and everything is empty/barren, except for my one bedroom.\n\nNow on antidepressants and seeing a psychiatrist.  I'm not sure how effective they are. I think they might help me focus a bit better on things i'd rather be focused on, but it's subtle.  I tried implying something more might be going on... or that I needed more help but my psychiatrist just seems fine with giving me SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics... just treating for depression/ocd... he doesn't seem interested in much beyond the norm and has never clearly come out and told me what my diagnosis was despite seeing him for like 6 months.\n\nI've been unemployed for 2 years.\nI have never driven a car.  I'll never have a family.\nI'm not even sure i'll ever get another job. I don't feel like a person.\n\nI struggle to do what's required for basic survival these days.\nLately i've been overeating and oversleeping.  I know it, I know how to prevent it by tracking calories and being mindful but like everything it's all so much work.\n\nIt's just difficult to see the point to any of this. My current plan of doing nothing is obviously not sustainable and not good for me... I just am unwilling to do anything about it.\n\nIf I get through another day without drinking, and manage to keep my house clean or did some other productive thing I try and say it's okay that I did good, but it's difficult cause I can say that however many times I want in my head and believe it but at the same time I still feel like I failed at life.  \n\nI got no idea what to do.  Sell the house, move to the phillippines for a few years?  Just keep the status quo until they kick me out?  Get a job at Walmart or call center?  I dunno.  I got to do something different.  I wouldn't mind if someone just handed me a life in already good-working order and said \"here, trade up\".  I got no idea what a life that makes sense even looks like anymore.\n\nI'm not sure what the point of this post is, I like just putting it down somewhere I guess and if people respond how they like that's okay too.\n\ntldr; it's fine not to read it's just me babbling and mostly for myself anyhow.  maybe someone else can get something out of it.",

        "Origin_reddit": "This is my little story. \n\n2017 was one of the hardest years of my life. I rang in the New Year drunk and drugged out at a music festival in hope that my feelings of depression and anxiety could be steered away. The whole year I fought an internal battle with my mind every day. I saw each day of my life pass by. I woke up many mornings hoping I could go back to sleep and not wake up for a long time. I had days of some clarity, but my illness just got worse. I tried everything to cure my mental illness such as becoming more religious, finding new hobbies, going out more but nothing worked. My mind would be temporarily occupied but I still came home each night to my bed of sorrow and hopelessness. My bad thoughts not only affected me, but one of the most important people in my life, my boyfriend. He tried to help me. He became my therapist which later in time broke him. I ran to him every time I needed reassurance and love. And he surpassed my expectations of an amazing human being. But instead of this causing me to get better, I only got worse. My mind switched this and I began to question why I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happy. How could I have everything in the world? (A roof over my head, healthy family and friends, attending an amazing college, and dating this awesome human being). I simply could not understand how I could be depressed. I began questioning my relationship. Began doubting my life, my identity, my ideas, my thoughts, and my feelings for everything. The doubting got so bad that I just became empty. I felt nothing. And this completely terrified me. I had seen myself morph from a happy, determined and cheerful woman, to a terrified, guilty, depressed and confused little girl. I had no idea why my life was falling apart. I saw myself deteriorate as the days, weeks and months passed. My life was falling apart and I had absolutely no control nor will to fight. I decided to end my relationship of 3 and a half years. One of the hardest decisions I had to make. Before my illness, I knew I was going to marry this person. Our relationship was no near perfect, but we loved each other so much. But now, how could I be selfish and be with someone when I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have my life, my feelings, or my issues figured out. For once, I understood the stupid cliche of \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not you, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me\u00e2\u0080\u009d. My biggest fear of hurting him, had became a reality. My entire life completely fell apart from having a stupid thought that I labeled bad. I over thought this idea I had and it morphed into a fear, a phobia and a obsession in my mind. I simply wanted to be perfect for my significant other but I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I have my first therapy session with my new therapist next week, January 5th. I have hope that this time, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m able to stick with it. I regret not continuing with my therapist when I first saw myself changing. I think, if only I had stayed in therapy, if only I had continued my medication, my illness would have not gotten so bad. I was a ticking time bomb and I just ignored myself. \n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten this far of reading my dumb post, please, I beg you, if you are going through some mental health issues, please get medical help. Please. It was one of dumbest mistakes I have ever made in my life. Please, listen to your body and your mind. I always took my mental health for granted and now I wish I could go back every day to a day of normality where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not struggling with my mind. ",

However, I had to take a drug screen for work and I read that Fluoxetine can give a false positive result in the UDS and I didn't want to tell my potential employer that and take anti - depressants for the fear of stigmatizing. Anyway, I stopped both SSRIs 1 week before the test (now is 10 days without them) and I don't feel any different, in fact if anything, I feel happier, but the most striking was my marked increase in my libido and the capability to ejaculate once again :) When I was on the SSRIs I had turned into an asexual creature and if I \"force\" my self to have sex or watch porn I had a half - @ass erection and (kind of whiskey d!ck) and more often than not I had to fake and orgasm (using a condom) or if by any chance I can finish is after a long \"banging\" and with an almost painful spasms of my legs, really weird sense.

Even though I tell everyone I will not kill myself because I couldn't bear traumatizing anyone, I know telling them I want to die isn't helping me or them. It's time for me to put away suicide as my cry for help. If I really feel low I know the folks at /r/SuicideWatch are comforting and I frequent the sub to offer support as well. They get me. I will probably share with my will-be therapist as well instead of family and friends because they are not my therapists. Brings me to my next goal.\n\n*-Stop treating family and friends as therapists.*\n\nAnd by this I mean dumping my existential crises on everyone is not okay. They don't know how to help. I shouldn't expect them to help. I need real counseling from someone with experience and someone who can actually listen without getting burnt out from me. I know everyone needs a shoulder to cry on. But I am chronically depressed and anxious and I am always asking for far too much when I ask for shoulders to cry on. I am asking for shoulders to cry on for hours long. It's not good for anyone.\n\n*-I will take care of my body.*\n\nI notice differences in my mood when I eat unhealthy and my binge eating only worsens this. Regardless if depression makes me binge eat or if binge eating makes me depressed, I need to clean my diet up. I did a really good job of this last summer and I believe I can do it again. I can do this.\n\n*-I will believe in myself.*\n\nNo more negative talk downs. I have to believe I can be better than who I was. I have to believe I can be better. I want to see myself as better. Maybe depression will never go away. But I have to learn to cope sustainably. I have to stop giving up at every mountain and wall and obstacle.\n\n*-I will expect care from myself and only myself.*\n\nNo more dependence on others. I need to become more independent because I am very attached and attach easily.\n\nMaybe a lot of this sounds like keeping things inside and bottling up. But I want to be as transparent as I can when it is appropriate instead of when it is inappropriate. I want to talk to a therapist exclusively about deep personal woes.

I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anyone to talk to about this and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to introduce it to anyone. It hurts me as well as others. ",

We were all kind of drunk and my boyfriend's friend asked a friend of mine if he take a shot from her belly button and she said no. He then asked me and u felt bad for him because he seemed really desperate, so I laid on the pool table and one of my friends poured the shot in my belly button and put a lemon in my mouth. He did the shot and then took the lemon out of my mouth with his mouth.\n\n\nMy boyfriend is very upset. I was buzzed and was just having a good time and I didn't mean anything sexual by it.\n\n\nWe have been dating for a couple of months.\n\n\n\nWhat should I do to make things right with him? I love him a lot and only want to be with him. I tried talking to him and he gives me one word answers and walks away. I have been crying for the last hour and I don't know what to do. I have anger and emotional problems and I'm not sure what's wrong with me.\n\n\nWhat should I do?\n",

For the first time in over a decade I had a couple months where I didn't want to kill myself, and that fell apart as quickly as it started. I'm worse off than I've been in a long time, and attempted suicide 4 times in the past 3 months, ending up with two hospitalizations and being committed to behavioral center. The only thing that kept me from attempting tonight is a fear of failure, ending up back in a hospital, and the fact that I now live with my parents again. I guess the fact that at some point last year I didn't want to die made me hesitant to follow through with my promise, but honestly I hate that I didn't. It's just another thing that I couldn't hold myself to. I don't really know why I'm writing this, I wanted to tell someone but I don't have anyone to tell that will actually listen at this point.

TLDR: A friend of mine rapidly fell ill and has cancer - three tumors in his kidney which is the primary cancer and two tumors in his brain. Anyone who's familiar with stage 4 brain cancer knows how this ends. Best friend of 15 years cut off from me after I admitted to them I was diagnosed last week with Aspergers. Same friend has had my back through my mental health issues (bipolar, several anxiety disorders, anorexia, alcoholism) and somehow bails for autism?\n\nI thought I couldn't feel lower until I was the one hearing about a NYE party I wasn't invited to by my other friend. Three friends and two are treating me like shit (or I'm over analysing, I don't know) and one's dying. I've been too sick with walking pneumonia to be able to see them in hospital.\n\nI don't know what to do. I've been emotionally blunted/numb since August (physical inability to cry) as well as skills from years of CBT, DBT and CPT aren't really doing much. I feel like shit. I was the only one online on PSN tonight, the only one playing WoW and I can't focus on Netflix. I feel like a fucking loser and wonder why I'm always alone. It's not JUST because I'm sober, people still can hang out without drinking, but every year I'm alone. I was alone on Christmas. I was alone on Thanksgiving. I can't go out to Tim Hortons (my usual place to be to write and journal) because it's -37C and that's just not happening.\n\nI don't know what the hell I want out of posting here, I've just found myself at this sub reddit more and more and I guess tonight I needed to get this off of my chest. Lord knows if I do it on FB someone will call the police again for a wellness check (despite knowing I 1) have a safety plan with my therapist I see weekly and 2) have been known IN THE PAST to get myself to the psych ER when I'm feeling low enough) or accuse me of drama or something else.\n\nI don't know. Fuck the holidays, fuck new years and I wish I had friends who cared. Everyone I've ever tried to meet online or in any of my games either turned out to be transphobic, homophobic and absolutely psychotic the second I refused their advances. I just want fucking conversation where someone's end game isn't to get laid (I'm asexual so good luck bruh) or treat me like a piece of shit.",
