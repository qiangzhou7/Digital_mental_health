I have a history of depression and self harm (not suicidal, just really numb when depressed) which my friend doesn't know much about, but he knows me well so he will relate instantly. \nTrickier thing is that he is really far away (he moved to GB, I am in Germany. He is going through a rough patch himself, just before christmas he got rejected by the first woman he approached after his wife died early 2014. He is mentally stable though and I am sure he'd want to know this, I am just not sure how to tell him really. I can't word this in free speech, I am not a native speaker and I want this to be as clear as can be. I do fear the text might be too much and/or weird? I have no proper judgement anymore...\n\nhere the text, I'd appreciate any help. thank you\n\nSo, first of all, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect anything from you, I just need to share with someone who I knows me well enough to understand and I need you, as a friend, to know about this in case it will get worse (no worries, this might sound overly dramatic, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that big of a deal for me since I am used to it) \nA few months back I started feeling stressed and burned out without being able to put a finger on why that is since realistically I had less to do than like a year back. I explained it to myself with lack of interaction with others or dull tasks which have to be done over and over or just hormonal crap and took that for the reason why I felt mentally unstable.\nI tried to work on it, made sure to get some breaks here and there, was drawing and painting and meeting with people but things didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get better (which I only realized a few days back)\nThe first time I was alarmed was when the urge to just run away for a day or two. There I realized for the first time that my mind is not sending the right signals, since I love the boys and xxx and being away wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be nice at all since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d miss the kids for sure.\nStill thinking it was an overload of work I talked to xxx, telling him all this and asking him for help (like helping out around the house, that kind of help) which he tries to to his best efforts. \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still not getting better. I had a proper meltdown on my birthday and on second day of christmas, still not releasing fully what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on. This night I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sleep, I went to bed at 11:30, fell asleep close to 1 am and woke up around 2:15 (thank you fitness tracker for the accurate information) The baby woke me and I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fall back asleep although I tried everything that would usually help. So I laid there thinking it all through and then all kinds of bad memories popped up. You know that I have the worst memory and that I am amazing with \u00e2\u0080\u009cforgetting\u00e2\u0080\u009d things I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to remember, though they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gone for good\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \nNot sure why the normal version of me always decides not to find a way to truly process all the stuff so this shitty version of me wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have so much to feed on but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it is now. I also realized that I have a general numbness when it comes to feeling emotions, I'm never very happy or enjoy things to the fullest, nor am I really sad nor angry or anything, everything is a little muted. That I actually hate and fear the most, becoming numb and empty.\nSo, this leaves me where I am now. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not unbearable or anything, but I am afraid where\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lead to eventually. I want to be a good mum and a full functioning person\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \n\nI think I needed you to know, as I said, in case things go a lot south and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d need your support.\n",

We hadn't talked in over half a year because I blocked him due to the fact that I felt he was constantly leading me on. A couple of months ago he found a way to reach out to me and I ended up calling him and we met up. I ended up kissing him, which is not my nature because I would like to wait till marriage to do anything sexual. Kissing is not too much of a big deal for me but it is something special. I began talking to him again and we would hang out and kiss. I had an emotional breakdown in front of him at one point and that is when I realized that I really liked him. I decided it was time for us to have a talk about where our relationship was going because I had many boundaries and he had many expectations that crossed those boundaries. I finally had a talk with him where he didn't take me very seriously and constantly made jokes about sex and how that's what he wanted from me, till I realized he wasn't merely joking, the things he said had a lot of truth to them. I felt very stupid for being so oblivious to the fact that this man that I have known since high school was such a dirt bag. I ended up leaving his car mid conversation because he wasn't taking me seriously and we haven't really talked since. The following day I felt so liberated. I never felt so happy in my entire life. I realized that I deserved much better but the issue is, I never seem to give that to myself. Despite feeling pretty great about my crappy fling ending, I feel like a part of me is upset. I always end up grieving over people who didn't really try with me and for some reason I don't care this time. For some reason, I want him to see what he missed out on.

My boyfriend was always there for me even though, at the time, my anxiety wad mainly caused by him (emotionally). He understood and was the only one who could calm me down.  Post emotional shit I was also very depressed because I was disappointed in the person I became. Because morally I'm very black and white and I let my boyfriend fall in my Gray space. And that was new because I've never loved someone like I love him. He is the light of my life and existence no matter how much shit we have been through in the last 3.5y.

        "Origin_reddit": "Hi all.\nThis is my first post on reddit even though I've used it for quite a long time and I haven't even made a single comment, either. The reason for that is because I've got severe cyber anxiety (scientifically discovered yet or not). Despite having many ideas and experiences to share online, the fear of being attacked, mocked, insulted or looked down prevents me every time. Like many of people here, I've also got social anxiety and depression, accompanied with a naturally boring personality, which make it nearly impossible for me to make friends and maintain relationship. In my secondary and high school, I used to have a number of close friends who valued me, wished me a happy birthday every year and even gave me small birthday presents but not anymore since I went to college and suffered from depression for the first time. I didn't contact them anymore so they probably thought I lost interest in them and let me go too, while it was just my depression which kept me from maintaining relationship in my life. Throughout these years, I've only got groupwork mates, fake friends (been bullied and stabbed in the back by them) and some regular acquaintances, all of whom don't care to be my close friends inspite of my kindness and will to be friends with them. Yesterday was my birthday and I planned to turn the internet off that day because I didn't want to stare at the truth that no one would care about me, no one would wish me a happy birthday although they all got notification of it on SNS. Today, I turned on the internet trying to trick myself that today was just another regular day, no birthday ever happened in order to hurt less but it was in vain. Like previous years, no notifications of any birthday wishes from anyone, even one college friend who treats me quite well (but he probably doesn't consider me a worthy friend, which I've felt so far).\nI'm not the type to show my misfortune and vulnerability to anyone beside my parents because I'm really scared to be laughed at or attacked, it took me much of my courage to share it here for I couldn't keep it in my chest any longer. I didn't intend to make it this long at first. I have longed for someone's empathy even if it comes from a stranger on the internet because I need to feel that I'm still connected with the world, to feel that someone still considers me a human being with the need of being cared for, not an unworthy person for anyone to give a sht like I've been. Although I have wanted to take my life and nearly attempted to do it many times, I couldn't do it because I've still got my parents who love me. Maybe in the future after they've left me, I might do it but not now, so I need a reason to keep going.",

        "Origin_reddit": "On New Years Eve, I was so convinced that I was going to spend it alone. And I was going to end my meaningless life on new year. \n\nI ended up spending it with my boyfriend, who made me realised that I was actually cared for, and loved, and gave me a chance at believing that I would have a future in front of me. Letting someone be the reason for me to live isn't going to be good in the long run, but as for now, it's good enough. I actually want to stick around and see what happens. Maybe it's going to turn out fine, and not as bad as my thoughts were telling me. \n\nHe held my face and made me look into his eyes. He whispered that he loves me and didn't want me to leave. He said that he will never ever find anyone else. I don't know why or how, but it was as if he knew what was going through my head. I never told him my plans after all. I felt bad and wanted to cry. He made me promise that I am never going to leave him alone. He knew. He is a precious and beautiful person. I cant bear ever breaking his heart and destroying his life. I've decided that I'm going to try my hardest to commit to having a good life with him. I just don't want to pass my suffering onto anyone. I know what that's like. \n\nHaving said that, i'm always scared and anxious that I won't have the strength to fight my demons. I know that he would always be there for me and not let me fight my battles alone. And sometimes I'm scared that he might leave, and I wouldn't know what else to do. I just want to be happy with the person I love. I hope that 2018 allows me to do that. ",
