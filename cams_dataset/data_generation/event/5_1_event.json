        "Origin_reddit": "I don't know how to preface this. I guess, maybe, that I don't understand, and I am not understood. This is really shameless of me, to post. But here goes nothing.\n\nIsolation plagues me, like, cancer plagues a person. I'm not comparing the grimness, cancer is terrible. But, I am comparing, how it's impossible to truly get rid of. Or at the very least, very very hard.\n\nYou see, communication, to me, is like trying to draw. In what way? Well, imagine you're drawing a wolf, but you're not good at drawing. So you think of a design, and in your head it works out, it looks amazing! Then, as soon as you go to put it on paper, it all falls apart and you end up crumpling the paper and trashing it.\n\nImagine, like that, but with vocal conversation. This is like, a giant wall, between me and anyone else. Nobody can get close to me. I can't get close to anyone. Nobody can even see me. I'm like a radio station broadcasting into the abyss.\n\n*That's just who I am.* Nothing will fix that. So, I'm doomed, to loneliness and isolation. So is the way of life.\n\nNot many people know what it's like to be that isolated. To be an alien among humans, to be, what seems like, the last of your kind. Everyone rejects you, because it's clear, you're not human. Your movements, the way you compose yourself, people can *JUST TELL*. And they avoid you. It's terrible, people get mad at you, scapegoat you, and you can't defend yourself on your own.\n\nSince I was born, this is how it's been. The terror of a nightmare I once had, has slowly become an everyday thing. I'll attempt to explain the nightmare.\n\nHere it goes : I was walking down a hallway. I was hit by sadness, isolation, stress. Not unusual. But then someone says something that throws me over the edge. I want to scream. I try to scream. I'm screaming. But there is no sound. I try to punch everything around me, and every punch lands featherlight, as if there was no intent behind it. I can't blow off anything, it's just fuming inside of me. I collapse hysterically crying(yet, not making a sound, even if I tried) and i awake with wet eyes.\n\nIt's the most terrifying nightmare I've ever had, yet, eerily reminiscent and metaphorical of exactly how I feel. Voiceless... It's so bad, I can't explain the isolation, I can't explain the loneliness, being someone so cold, yet, with so much to share, but you can't share it, and nobody will share with you. It's not fun, it's terrible, it's so bad and it's not something that can be fixed. It consumes me every single day.\n\nIt's not *just* the depression speaking. Legitimately, I have no chance of ever properly communicating. Do you know how that feels? Does anyone know how that feels? I'm sure they do, but that doesn't make it easier.\n\nIt's a stabbing pain, when, even people you've grown up with your whole life, you're not connected with. My mother means literally nothing to me. Nobody means anything to me, and I WISH THEY DID. God, I WISH THEY DID. It's hardddd though, I can't explain it. I'm trapped in a bunker nobody can penetrate. Nobody even knows I'm in here, so why would they try? They just assume that I am the cold, heartless, stone walls that encase me.\n\nI could never explain it. That's what hurts so bad. The headaches, the pain. It's unbearable. I frequently dream about just shooting up a ludicrous amount of heroin and drifting into an endless sleep.\n\nI don't want to live anymore, I want to be on the moon, where I belong. Maybe, just maybe, I'll be there soon. And I'll be sad for never.\n\nEveryone has a sense of loneliness at some point, a yearning for belonging. For me, these are two facts of life, not temporary situations, just due to who I am. That's what hurts the most. Even if I  wanted something different, and I DO I DO, I could never fucking have it. It's so bad, its terrible, it's undefeatable.\n\nIt's not just a temporary state. Don't tell me \"it'll pass\". No it fucking won't, I'm not just saying that. It literally won't pass. It's not \"The depression speaking\". It is *LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE SHRED OF WHO I AM*. And nobody, will ever try to break through those grim walls. I'm just an emotionless enigma to them, people just accept it. I want to leave this lonely place. But I can't. It's a curse, an everlasting curse I will carry to the grave.\n\nI'm getting a headache.",

I finished college and got into university, but still I was pretty depressed and had a few guys in my romantic life. Last year I met this wonderful guy who is my actual boyfriend. He's loving, caring, sweet and very in love with me. I couldn't really ask for more: i have a family, I'm pretty good at uni, have a boyfriend and everything. But still, my demons keep haunting me. I know it sounds horrible to say, but I really wish I was dead. I don't know, I see the bad in everything: i hate myself, i don't like my body even though many boys told me i'm beautiful, i wanna cut again, i hate how i am, my voice, my hands, my legs, my hair, my shyness, my behaviuor, my life.

I'm not even being creepy, desperate, or too forward on them either, I'm just being myself. \n\nI often ask if people on reddit would be willing to go out with me HYPOTHETICALLY if I asked them out. Most said 'no' because I'm not their type, which I mean again, indicates that I'm no one's type. I mean, what can I do then? Am I really datable and boyfriend material?\n\nI try to work on myself as much as I can, I go to the gym consistently and I'm in decent shape, try to take care of my appearance and dress nicely, get good grades in my classes, have a high-paying internship that pays more than some full-time college grads. I try to put myself out there and try different hobbies but I also shelter myself a little with video games. But overall, is that not enough?\n\nPeople say that I'm not ugly but what does that mean? Are people blowing smoke up my ass? People say I'm just average-looking, which means that if I didn't try to put in effort, I would be ugly. I'm only average-height too, which kinda sucks. Here's me: https://imgur.com/a/6j6Zc\n\nAverage-looking, undatable, don't fit anyone's mold, perfect for no one.\n\nWhat else do I have to be then? How do other people who are severely depressed or anxious get into relationships? When is it my turn? How do you feel about me? Would you hypothetically date me and why not? If you're a woman, I appreciate your input with a lot of value, whatever it is that you're gonna say.",

There is a loss of interest in activities I typically enjoy, a growing desire to be around/talk with friends, yet the drive to isolate is developing a storm within myself.\n\nI am in my thirties, many worries I had in my twenties are gone (job, housing, making friends). The struggle is in the remaining challenges. I value myself by how desirable I imagine I am. I define my desirability by how needed I am in mainly non-monetary ways (i.e. work doesn't really count, though it gives me some strength). Often I find more time on my hands than others, which leads me to reach out to friends much more than being reached out to instead. My friends and family say they enjoy spending time together and we make small talk about promises to connect. Many friends and family are actually busy and may only find time to connect infrequently. I can only see/share a snapshot of our lives and our connections. This makes me feel like less of a person. I want more people (two to three friends someday day) I connect with more than quarterly or annually. \n\nThis has been a generally positive year. This lull has been much less severe than in prior years (during the holidays specifically). The sadness is more powerful in the duration and lack of attributable events. I want a reason to be sad, to fight or deconstruct said reason and \"bounce back\" or at least have an argument against these feelings. \n\nThe hum of daily activities continues, heavy in each moment. A white noise that slowly is clouding my routine ushering me closer to the basics of eat, work, sleep, then repeat. The fog is comforting in the simplicity of the path left for me to travel, however the path is not the direction I want. \n\nI want to see around me again, I want to clearly view my challenges and triumphs, and most of all I want to feel desirable again. The time it takes to push through this cycle is exhausting. I wish to rid myself of this monotonous hum that is pushing me towards isolation.\n\nI have no real expectations of improving my situation from posting, yet I am hopeful I might be distracted for a bit by sharing.

If this shouldn't be here, someone please let me know and I'll remove it.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nI've felt like total garbage emotionally/mentally (and physically) since around May of this year. I think what I'm feeling is a midlife crisis. I felt like my twenties were never going to end and when it hit me that they were about to, I felt a tremendous sense of time running out and started realizing some terrible truths. First, I'm in the exact same place I was when I was 20 in spite of many failed efforts to fix that. I started seeing signs of aging all of a sudden. But what really did me in was finally landing a full-time job and being ecstatic thinking that I could finally afford to live on my own and be independent instead of continuing to live with my lunatic parents. Then it hit me that I wouldn't even be able to afford to share rent with multiple roommates even on a full-time salary and that realization just broke me. I haven't recovered.\n\nWhen I would fall into a depression before, I knew it would pass and I just waited it out. However, all these age-related things hitting me at once and feeling like I'm so far behind my peers and feeling like a colossal failure, it's the first time in my life that I've ever felt like I wouldn't be okay. For a while, my life was okay with moments of feeling awful. Now, feeling awful is the norm with fleeting moments of being okay.\n\nSometimes it's an overnight change. I'll be depressed for a week - crying every single day, that crushing feeling you get in your chest when you feel your worst, wanting nothing more than to die, researching suicide methods, etc. Then for a day or two, I'll be closer to normal or maybe even a little happy. Then something will set me off (like making a minor mistake, or sometimes nothing at all triggers it) and I fall right back down into that hole and become miserable again. I just feel like life will never get any better and I don't really want to stick around to see how much worse everything is going to get. I was freaking out so badly back in the summer that I gave myself godawful muscle pain in my back and ribs that was mistaken for a pulmonary embolism and I was sent to the ER. A $1500 hospital bill to pay when I make $10 an hour didn't really help me to feel better about my financial position.\n\nIs it normal for depression to do this? To come in waves, but never truly get better? Or do I not even know how to be depressed correctly and I'm just being a crybaby and having a bunch of consecutive adult tantrums? I've lost my desire to do pretty much all my hobbies at this point and when I try to pick them back up, I just find them to be frustrating instead of enjoyable. I just think I'm good and truly done with everything, and knowing I'm too much of a wuss to actually kill myself just compounds those feelings of hopelessness.",
