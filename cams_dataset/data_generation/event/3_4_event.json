Like I used to get more triggered and depressed simply because I was self-aware that I had an illness, but now that's gone. Is this just another symptom of apathy?

I've spent the last few weeks, maybe months feeling worthless and sad and wanting to die but not wanting to kill myself, so I fantasized about getting into an accident and dying in a way that looked like it wasn't on my own hands. I got out of the car with just some whiplash and some bruises but I'm fine otherwise.\n\nIt's a miracle I'm alive right now. I spun out on the freeway going 75 mph. I got hit by another car. The witnesses and patrol officer and the EMT all expected me to be unconscious or way more badly hurt than I was.

        "Origin_reddit": "I have MS and I have done everything to pull myself together and build a life. It went ok for half a year but then it started. I was VERY motivated for university, I started my first year of physics major in October and made very healthy habits(eating healthy, sports, morning routines, reading every day, planning the day and week, working deeply without distractions, etc.) and it went pretty good. I didn't expect everything to go perfect, far from it, but I did expect to have some control. But then we had to talk about medicine. My parents are superstitious and I am a sceptic; I think critically and I analyse everything to truly understand the situation. My parents wanted to start alternative medicine and I am fine with that for as long as it is not dangerous as I wish to let my parents be at some ease. They found about this Vitamin D3 treatment which can be VERY VERY dangerous(my kidneys can fail any day) and we had soooo mannyy FIGHTS over it, it was chatastrophic. My mum started to hurt me bad with her shit and dad was just ignorant and arrogant. Moreover, the medicine for MS is VERY DANGEROUS as well, a girl of my age got diabetes and Thyroid Disease so she had to even drop out of fucking musical academy which was her dream just because of MEDICINE. We had countless talks and fights and shit ever since my uni has started and everything has gone to SHIT. All my habits are gone, all my plans are ruined and I probably even have depression now.\n\nYou see, when I got the MS diagnosis I spent A WEEK having an existential crisis and I really decided I wanted to be a physicists no matter what, as I felt like that is part of my identity, to truly become a master in something. I have decided to be a physicists roughly a year before that, however now that decision became a huge part of my life. But every time we fought at home I couldn't work for days no matter what; I tried to push and concentrate and I even started going to library to study but after a month even that wouldn't help anymore. I have very good friends, but they are of little to no help and I LOVE my parents, but they try way TOO DAMN HARDDDDDDDD, they are beating my mental health down every day. \n\nFor example: yesterday I was feeling very depressed even though I felt motivated the day before, it just came out of the blue, so I was super slow and lazy and it was impossible to get out of bed. My parents saw that and started worrying, the first thing they said is that I need to snap out of it and that im just pretending because I am lazy, do you know how much that hurt????!!!! But I am rational and I was somehow able to keep my anger and sadness and pool of emotions down to explain them FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME what is going on with me and why is it so but they just wouldn't understand! This time they threatened me throwing me out and you know what, I fucking agreed because I was so desperate that I literally thought that there is no other way. I was SO TIRED that I thought this was my destinity, that im such a pure piece of fucking shit that even my parents want to get rid of me. I just wanted to go and just live my life. I even started planning on how to get a job and shit, it was PURE TORTURE. I have cooled down since then, but now I have not worked for school yet again and I am even more behind, yet fucking again, will it ever end? Why am I even trying with bloody physics which is HARD when I know I have such a terrible condition. I magically passed almost all the midterms and everyone was happy that I did and they kept saying I am amazing and shit, I was so angry because NO ONE understood how much I am suffering because I am not able to learn 10% of what I should be learning, its like being a kid in front of a toy store looking through glass at a toy you wanna sooo desperately have but you KNOW you will never have it. I even tried to talk to a psychologist and it helped the first day and I was so happy that I finally had some real help, but then she said she would call me next week for next talk from the meeting but she never called and it has been a month since then now and I dont even know her name nor can I contact her, she is a psychologist at the hospital! I feel so dead, I don't knwo what to do. Every singe day I fight myself, I fight to gather some energy and motivation to do the work and have fun, but every week is ruined by fighting with parents and now almost every day is ruined by just being empty, dead without energy and tired and with hate for myself and shit. \n\nI feel lonely, not understood, desperate, without any energy(cannot even have fun, im forcing myself to have fun more than actually having it), im scared all the time, i feel like people just wanna quickly be done with me cuz im a burden, i have insomnia, i sleep too long, sometimes i cant eat at all while on other times i binge eat like crazy and i find myself looking for food every 2 minutes, im scared of studying, im scared of talking to anyone but a professional cuz they wont understand, Im overthinking all the time, i cannot concentrate anymore at all(e.g. got a huge burst of motivation cuz of a fight few days ago and started to work on math but it lasted 15 minutes and then i felt HUGE resistance and my mind went batshit crazy). The only thing missing is the thought of kling myself, but i doubt it will ever cross my mind for more than 5 seconds, as I am rational enough AND I know very well that life is beautiful and valuable. I just CANNOT find a way out of my situation, im caught in this room with walls closing in on myself, but there has to be a way out, but im close to breaking, right now I spend 90% of the time being depressed and then I have these rational outbursts that are seemingly the product of my past self and they seem to protect me and that is why I am here and not dead yet. My healtjh is getting much worse though and MS is getring worse too, ive gotten a new attack a few months ago and it is still active, I cant feel my feet normal anymore, i feel much less and the feeling is weird and its driving me fucking crazy, tho i have gotten a bit used to it. Now I do t even know how I feel about my parents, i fucking love them, but at the same time i hate them for driving me crazy, but i dont blame them, but i still do, but I really really do not know how to feel about them. For new year they were all kind and shit but i cannot take this kindness seriously anymore. I know they mean it but i cannot smile normally i cannot be happy. But i still want to be on good terms with them. What a shitty family we are.\n\nI posted this here to gather some feedback information, new ideas, or new information to help myself because I do not want to give up, ever, for I still believe I can become a physicist, even if it sounds fucking stupid. If there is ONE FUCKING THING that I want to do in my entire life is to research physics and solve math problems. As you can see, I still have MS to deal with, so even if I somehow deal with depression, I will still have this monster over my head which could strike me down any time. For example, how will i deal with a family, I cannot imagine putting such a massive burden on someone I would love, will I ever even have a wife and kids?(I hugely respect what Hawking did and I think it was the right thing to do)\n\nWelp, sorry for this long ass tiresome rant about my life, I know I just stole precious time from you.",

He died in April and I've been functioning but I feel fucking terrible most days. I wake up feeling so shitty, like complete despair.

I graduated university with a bachelor degree in business but my GPA is horrible, as my physical and mental health during my studies was terrible. My grades improved over time but the damage was done. I'm now looking for my first full-time job (I have a year of part-time work experience) and have had no luck since graduating in August of 2017. \n\nIts gotten so bad that I constantly doubt myself, I feel that I am stupid and really have no future prospects in terms of career. I constantly use various tools to try to justify to myself that I'm not a failure (such as IQ/Psychological Tests), but they really don't mean anything. I feel that I have to justify myself for things outside that were out of my control and obviously, people in the real world don't care and will more than often see me as a liability.\nOn top of this, due to my treatment of my second cancer, my left arm lacks fine motor skills. I'm already handicapped in the competitive job market and why would any employer hire me over some other graduate with better marks and is physically capable. \n\nMy personal confidence is at an all-time low as well, being a 5'4ft balding 23-year-old doesn't help me fit in and frankly, with my understanding of how nature works, I am screwed.

I just wanna preface by saying that I'm going to talk about 3 different girls in my life, 2 of which are integral to this, (A and B), however I want to say I'm not depressed because of girls, I wouldn't be posting here if it was just about heartbreak (not that there is anything wrong with that, I just don't want people to get that imoression from this)\n\nI've suffered from depression off/on since I was about 15, so it's been 8 almost 9 years. By off/on I mean it has hills and valleys, it's always kind of there, but at the same time kind of can go away? I don't know if that makes much sense.. right now, and definitely for the past 6 months, it's the longest time I've ever spent at the bottom of a valley, and it also happens to be one of the deepest I've ever been down. \n\nI'm definitely an ugly duckling story. A lot of my depression started originally as an awkward teen, I had long emo hair, I was very skinny and always have been, I was shy, had very bad social anxiety to the point I would vomit all the time, even when at school and going out with friends. I never liked the town I grew up in, people knew me to be a certain way or thing, that when I tried to change it just didn't work.. \n\nFast forward from when I was 15 and when I finally moved out and went to college, at 18, I had truly 'blossomed'. I looked good. And for my 4 years at college I slayed. I've been with over 100 women, spent my nights going out partying, spending all my time with friends.. everything went away, my anxiety, my depression and my awkwardness. \n\nDuring that time however, I experienced an emotionally abusive relationship with girl A (protecting names).. this was in the early days, and she amplified all my problems tenfold (until I finally escaped and my mental health improved).\n\nI met the girl of my dreams (at the time) when I was 20, and things were great until it ended, which sent me in to a spiral of sleeping with so many women to block out my feelings, I drank a shit tonne, I even did drugs (I'm not proud of it, and it was completely against character, I regret it deeply, but I'm just glad I wasn't hurt nor did I hurt anyone else during that time). This continued for a few months, and I finished college, jumped from job to job and had no clue where my life was going.. \n\nThen I met B. I met her just before I turned 22, and it was the best thing that's ever happened to me. She took away my pain and gave me help and support to steady myself in a way that nobody else ever had. I was so shut off from feelings and shut off from wanting to show emotion, that it took her a while for me to get me out of my cage that I had locked myself if.. but it was great, and I will always appreciate her for that... \n\nI moved home from Aberdeen where I had been to do college, due to a failed business attempt, and my flatmate was moving away too. B was staying in Aberdeen, and we decided on a \"long distance\" relationship. And it was fine, no problems whatsoever. I only lived a couple hours away on the train, so I saw her basically every weekend. Whilst home I started working with my dad, and just wanted to save money up. \n\nOne day, girl A messaged me.. I didn't want anything to do with her but B told me to forgive her and be friends.. I guess she was just too trusting. I decided to tell A I forgive her and we can be friends, but I never messaged her or anything and was just polite when she messaged me, but in all I left her alone.. This is the part that makes my blood boil, and makes my heart ache.. B and I fell out over a friend she had trying to say shit about me.. (she hated me, and I had no reason why).. that night I messaged A and we had deep chats and one thing lead to another and flirtatious texts were sent and a couple photos. I felt horrible. And I stupidly kept it a secret.. this all happened in January or last year.. and then in June of last year, girl A told girl B everything, as I had deleted and blocked A out of my life and she didn't like that... I have no clue what sparked it.. my only regret is I wasn't considerate and honest enough to tell B about what I did... \n\nFlash forward to today and I'm alone.. and have been since June. And this brings me to how I currently feel, and why I'm frustrated with where I'm at.. obviously going through college taught me how to break out of my depression, and I've been trying to follow it but... Nothings working and has started revealing more problems.. \n\nIf you've made it this far then thank you so much. There's not much more to read. \n\nI feel now lost more than ever. I've been going to the gym constantly almost every day for the past 4 months, to stay healthy and hoping it would keep me busy. I've gained weight, and physically I feel incredible. I've gone from 9st 9lbs to 11st and I feel I've finally escaped skinny me and all the people that made fun of my for looking like a rake (girl A). But it's not helped how I feel in my head.. \n\nI don't feel connected to my friends anymore, they've all moved away and I rarely get to see them, and most messaged go unanswered for days because they're busy.. I only have one friend that still lives in my town, and it pains me to say but I feel like the relationship isn't what it once was, and that we've gone on different paths, so it just feels awkward when I see him, however I do try to keep it going because I know isolation KILLS. \n\nI spend time with my family a lot, I love my family and they're very supportive and understand how I feel. However it just doesn't feel the same as hanging out with friends, and I find myself getting frustrated being around them a lot, even though they've shown me nothing but love, and it makes me feel even more awful feeling that way.\n\nI've thrown myself in to further studies and with work. I'm studying accounting niw to keep busy, and I work hard at my job to keep busy and give me money. I spend all my time working, studying, gyming, hanging out with family, and trying to see friends, so my life is full, but my heart just feels empty. I feel like I'm rotting from the inside.. \n\nI also don't connect with any of the things that once we're a great pastime for me.. video games just aren't the same as they were, I don't connect to any of the nerdy shit I used to like and I don't know what else to be interested in.. \n\nAnd finally.. I miss girl B. I no longer contact her, as I know she hates me for betraying her. I know she's getting on with her life, new man, working hard, all that.. I've deleted and blocked her from everything and haven't looked to see what she's up to (I just know what she's up to due to a friend telling me without me asking which felt like a fucking knife..). The old 20 year old me wants to hook up with girls and \"get under someone to get over someone\" but, I can't. My head and heart won't let me. I've tried meeting up with a couple girls but I just can't get in to it at all, and I have no desire to be with them.. \n\nJust to put a cherry on top the ice cream, girl A is now dating a friend who lives back in Aberdeen, so I've decided to cut him out of my life.. because I can't have any connection to girl A.. that's done a lot of horrible things to me in my life. \n\nI don't know if any of this makes sense at all, or if I even deserve to be posting here.. I'm working hard, going to gym, even seeing a therapist, keeping busy as all hell.. but still I feel so numb inside and wake up crying at night, unable to get my head and heart to agree to keep looking to the future.. \n\nThanks for reading if you have.

The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug? Thanks \n\nTLDR: Scared of the sexual side effects of Celexa, any positive experiences to ease my worry? ",

        "Origin_reddit": "Hey guys, so this might be a little long but I'll put a tl:dr at the end.\n\nI've had depression ranging from severe to moderate (depending on the month tbh) for the past couple of years along with social/general anxiety, kickstarted by the loss of my dad and made worse through by going through college with 0 friends and having absolutely nothing social to do. Last year I went to a psychiatrist who put me on Paxil, told me it'd do away with both my depression and anxiety and gave me a bunch of BS advice about how to make friends and the like (common sense type stuff I already know and try). Well after a month of Paxil I kinda turned into a different person, my anxiety was completely gone but my depression was through the roof, leading to me making a LOT of bad decisions. I went back to my psychiatrist telling him that I didn't think it was helping my depression, and he said that's normal and upped my dose from 20mg to 30mg. This made everything WAY worse; I felt like I was slightly drunk all the time (only comparison I can think of), and my inhibitions were like always gone. I started smoking cigarettes, hiring escorts, getting in fights with people for no reason, just crazy shit I NEVER would have done before. My general anxiety came back and then some, I started having panic attacks almost daily, hobby's I used to love just seemed worthless and boring, it just made everything I took it to prevent worse. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but on Paxil they were daily. It culminated in my roommates having an intervention with me telling and reminding me of everything I'd done and just how much more of a miserable asshole I'd become. So I stopped taking the Paxil (those brain zaps were fun) and went back to my psychiatrist explaining all of this to him, and he told me it had nothing to do with the Paxil and I just wasn't following his advice (which consisted of \"talk to people\", \"you don't need friends in college\", \"girls will like you when you have a successful career in the future\").\n\nSince being off the Paxil I have gone back to my old self, my roommates and my family have both told me I seem back to normal, I feel like I used to, I can enjoy video games and fishing again, but I'm still just as depressed and anxious as I was before the Paxil (plus now I'm hooked on cigarettes, so thanks for that Paxil). I went to my primary care doctor last week and explained all of this to him, and he recommended I see a psychologist, and gave me a script for 25mg Zoloft and .5mg Klonopin. I'm working on finding a psycologist at the moment, and the Klonopin helps a lot with my anxiety (though I know it's a benzo and not a long term solution), but I'm literally terrified to start Zoloft. I don't want to go through another experience like Paxil, I can say without a doubt that those 5 months were the worst most shameful and miserable of my life. So, with all that said, does anyone know if Zoloft is likely to cause this misery again? Or really does anyone just have any advice for me? I feel like I'm in a pit and everything they give you just digs the pit even deeper, I just need some advice.\n\nTL:DR - Was prescribed Paxil for 5 months, turned me into a monster and made me feel absolutely terrible. Now have a 25mg Zoloft perscription and am terrified of what's gonna happen when I take it. Any advice?",

I should say my psychiatrist did his fellowship at Johns Hopkins, the best medical school, and the ECT head went to Stanford and is certified in ect and connected to the (well-respected medical) university here (Tampa)\n\nI have been diagnosed variously schizophrenia /schizoaffective /and even bipolar. I was in a psych ward and left for dead pretty much at 18, recovered completely after detox from a crazy psych cocktail, got B. A, M. A. even taught abroad. Had a very stressful illness in a minor city in China and whatever medicine given either caused or exacerbated some delusional thinking. But I recovered in a major Chinese city on what I assume was sedatives. When I got back to the US I couldn't sleep and eventually went on the antipsychotic paliperidone and klonopin after trying various medicines including trazodone and got a job teaching English as a second language at a university , but decided to go off the antipsychotic , which went poorly as heavy depression set in again sparked by illness followed by psychosis and hospitalization twice, both psychosis remitting after a few days. Stayed on the paliperidone. \n\nFlash forward to this fall. Eventually decided I'd had enough of the inhuman feeling of paliperidone, I became ridiculously depressed and was having issues with my body freezing in place and moving in genral. One medicine (memantine) I took made me suicidal to the extent that i was arrested and involuntarily held in a hospital that my neurologist had suggested I get ect in if Ativan didn't work. (he also diagnosed multifocal dystonia and catatonia, which the catatonia the psychiatrists didn't seem to agree with) \n\nI was lucky because psychotic depression set in mildly after a few days in the psych ward but no one noticed and the next day I had ect. Been through four sessions since. After the first, the suicidality and inability to move much and psychotic depression went away, and, eventually, after a few weeks, I began to feel a sense of happiness for the first time in at least ten years  \n\nI've tried and has bad reactions to pretty much every atypical antipsychotic on the market, and been shot with Haldol at least 4 times.

I went to see my school therapist in the past, but, she seemed more to pressure me than actually help with my issues. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping the appointment goes well for me, because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard about other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experiences with therapists and they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go very well. So, as nervous as I am about it, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m (somewhat) determined it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be good. Wish me luck though, guys! ",

        "Origin_reddit": "The past few years I've been going through some mental health changes that have become quite alarming. I was feeling generally down and had tried to combat it with exercise, surrounding myself with positivity, trying new hobbies, etc. Slowly things started to change, I was becoming anxious around crowds, I'd get flustered in grocery stores when crowded, started feeling like I wanted to avoid the gym because of people, crying became a regular thing and my family's life started to revolve around if I was going to get triggered by something negative which would send me into a spiral of sadness or anger. This is not typical of me and I'm watching it unravel in front of me. I feel crazy! I started getting into these fogs, nothing seemed to be as exciting as they should be to me, go to an amusement park? Get new camera equipment? Go hiking? I love those things but all of a sudden it just felt like they were happening around me and I was just there, just experiencing it, and it didn't feel good to me the way it should. Suicidal thoughts always accompanied my bouts of sadness, so I decided to get some help.\n\nI went to see a counselor about how I was feeling. It was my first attempt to reach out and it went awful. Firstly, I should have mentioned that I had suicidal thoughts, but I didn't as I was ashamed of it, felt like it made me weak or that it would sound extreme. The councelor told me to stop pestering my family and that regardless if I went to therapy or took meds, they wouldn't work. That medication wouldn't work and that their therapist wouldn't have time to fit me in with their schedule and that I'd probably only get seen for 30 minutes at a time. I left feeling defeated and tried to use that to motivate myself to beat this on my own.\n\nThe past 6 months things have gotten worse. I was alarmed that one day I started feeling tired, like I was just done with \"feeling\" and wanted to die. It felt so casual to me to think that I wanted to electrocute myself in the bathtub and that it felt relieving to see a way to end this overwhelming feeling. I told my spouse to help me because I'm about to kill myself and I don't want to die, but I desperately hate this overwhelming whiplash.\n\nWe agree to try getting help again, but I put it off thinking I can try again to defeat it myself. Now, I've started getting panic attacks at the slightest hint of stress. It's like my brain is breaking. I start to hyperventilate and struggle to breathe. I've been getting sent into emotional spirals more often and again, I started thinking if I took some pain pills I could slit my throat in the bathtub.\n\nMy appointment is in a few days and I'm really nervous. I'm really sad about it because I feel like I'm crazy. I know that other doctor was wrong, but I'm afraid if this new doctor will be the same. I'm struggling so hard and I can't help myself anymore. I want to get help and I feel like I'm crazy that this is all happening because it's not me. I don't want to be like this and I don't want to have to live like this, in fear of my own self and getting triggered into sadness or hopelessness.\n\nI don't want to self diagnose, but I think something is wrong with me. This is definitely not normal to me.\n\nTL;DR: Can you give any tips as to handle talking to my doctor about all this? What do I say, what is important to mention?",
