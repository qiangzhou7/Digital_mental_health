Why prolong it if you've been dealt a shitty hand? Is society being selfish in wanting to see that people can change for the better just to affirm its own views of the world? The mere mention of suicide brings throngs of people trying to \"help\", and often instilling false hope. Will we ever ever say, \"yeah, it's a shitty situation. Offing yourself is probably the best option.\"\n\nThere is no cure for clinical depression, and I bet those who eventually do kill themselves were dragged through the mud before they did it, effectively prolonging their suffering. \n\nIf time is an endowed right, each of us should have the freedom to choose what we do with it.
