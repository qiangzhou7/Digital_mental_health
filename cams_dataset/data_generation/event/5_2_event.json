Restarting my 700th therapy session/s on Friday so hopefully she can sprinkle some fairy dust in my water or some shit cus as far as things go I'm losing the slither of faith I have left. \n\nThank you for listening. It's 1hr 30mins till New Year's and I hope I fall asleep as I'm not listening to all the fireworks and all this bullshit. Nothing to celebrate for me . If this doesn't make sense apologies as I spent a while typing this but I copy and pasted something so I had to re-type and not as detailed.\n\nAnd now in even using big ass words and im like the most dumbest illiterate mf ever \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00a6\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bd\u00e2\u0080\u008d\u00e2\u0099\u0082\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\n\nI know I'm in there somewhere buried deep. Just need to find a way to climb back to the top and be in control.    So far I feel like I've lost myself majorly and I'm not being my authentic self which is frustrating but I just need help moving away the debris and letting the water through.",
        "Event": "Feeling of defeat, sadness, and hopelessness; feeling like one is a \"hollow, pathetic husk of a person\" with a shattered mind and lost sense of self; struggling to find positivity or happiness in life despite efforts to fake smiles and maintain obligations; feeling alienated from others who seem to be \"naturally happy\"; feeling like one is stuck in a never-ending cycle of negativity and despair."

There is loud music here, people dancing and drinking, people I know really since long now - celebrating a new year. I'm being pulled in for a drink and dancing - I pretend like I am enjoying. I don't want them to know. I don't want anyone to know. Why would anyone care?\nI somehow thought it would be a good idea to come here. I don't know why. Maybe better than sitting in front of a screen - playing stupid games or watching videos. I really wanted this to work. I need this for 2018. I'm not feeling good. It's going to be a bad year.

But to make things worse, I'm just about as depressed as ever in terms of not wanting to do anything, escape sleeping, thinking about death, etc. It would seem like the main trigger for me at this very moment is that I was just laid off from work, and I just feel lost. I don't know how I'm paying my bills, I won't be able to go to my doctors because there goes my health insurance (guess I could apply for Medicaid idk) and just that feeling like I have no idea what I'm doing with my life.
