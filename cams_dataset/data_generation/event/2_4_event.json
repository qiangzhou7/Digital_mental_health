My two little brothers (both under 11. For reference I am 20) adore me, which is great, I love them too.... but the problem is that means they love to come a visit me, talk to me, play in the same room as me, etc.\n\nIt just feels like I never can relax... until everyone else is in bed, and I can do whatever I want and not have to worry about anything. \n\n**It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like living is my job, and when I get into bed is when I finally get off work.**\n\nMy therapist is telling me ways that I can get my sleep schedule to be more normal, so that way I can have more time in the day, but I was thinking about it and... why would I want that? I never feel fully comfortable in the day, and late at night is when I can finally just forget about everything. So why would I want to take that away? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m mean sure I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get a lot more done, but if I have to sacrifice the only time I can fully relax, is it worth it? ",

My grades have t always been great, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s freshman year and i already failed first semester of algebra, almost failing like one or two more classes, and have to retake algebra in the summer. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if I can do it man. Everyone says I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m smart and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not actually depressed and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have ADD when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked to them so many times. I do actually have ADD and am pretty damn sure after having heavy depressive symptoms for over two years I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d start to notice I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m actually depressed. No one takes a 15 year old kid seriously. Sure, I ride bmx which is like the only thing I live for (and photography), and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a funny guy too. Most people even say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty attractive, like a 9/10. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only had one official girlfriend, and two other girls I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a thing with. I do know that multiple girls like me, and one of my female friends even said she liked me before, and still does, so do I, but I think we both agree on just being friends. I honestly don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it would be the best thing to do to try and become more than friends. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably my best friend, and vice versa, and one of the only people I feel comfortable talking to about my shit, along with one other really good female friend. The thing is though, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been able to talk to them since my parents took my phone a couple weeks back before break, and now during break I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been able to have it or talk to anyone, or hang out. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not complaining or anything, I think no phone for now is actually good to take it easy on electronics and become more outgoing, trying to become involved in people and nature, or just other things than texting and playing games all day. Although I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been filling my time with anime most of the day, and I have wrestling practice almost every day for two hours which keeps me really toned and healthy which is good. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just tired man, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know why I just wish I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t existing. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just rambling shit.

How can you bring children into this world? How can you expect them to be happy?\n\nI want to die. It's all I can think of. This suffering isn't ending, because I am never good enough and I never will be. My parents tell me to just suck it up and fight against it. To stand up for myself for once. To try to change. But I can't. I'm just weak. They're right, I'm never going to accomplish anything in life. I'm never even going to be able to get a job and keep it.

I really liked almost all of my colleagues but hated the work, as well as the studies I had to do alongside (work related qualifications). That, alongside depression that had gone undiagnosed and untreated for, let's say 9 years at the time, led to me letting the contract end and leaving.\n\nMy last contracted day was 31 August 2016. I started taking antidepressants in mid December of that year and started online Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in late December just gone (having been on the waiting list since October 17, maybe).\n\nIt feels like I've gotten dumber by the day. At my worst I was playing videogames for maybe 16 hours a day, just for the escapism. I listen to a lot of podcasts these days but even then, if the weather is shitty and/or I can't drag myself outside then I'll just throw GTA V on and grind that whilst listening, doing the same boring missions that I stopped enjoying long ago for the in-game money that I don't even need to buy stuff that I don't even want. \n\nMy concentration was always better in work compared to home study, but the brain is a muscle too and I fear I've lost that ability to concentrate in this time out of work. It feels like I've got dumber every single day in the pursuit of that escape. Even when I'm listening to podcasts that are educational, that doesn't matter. It feels like the brain itself has lost its processing power and memory. \n\n&gt;Edit regarding escapism: I feel the need to distract myself at all times. I've had a rail card application pending for around a week now, I just remembered after posting - sorting it now. How am I supposed to be relied upon to do the simplest of tasks? \n\nI have stopped socialising, having seen one friend once in I don't know how many months, I even stopped chatting online, having muted the group chat. I just seem to have no interest in what they're talking about and don't have much going on to talk about myself. As a social circle we don't seem to have many common interests besides football, gigs/festivals and getting wasted. \n\nI had a hot streak in early December with applications and got five job interviews in a week and a half or so, being successful in my third &amp; fourth choice, accepting my third choice. Admittedly it's still pretty good, pays better than the fourth as well, but it is further away. This sounds like a r/humblebrag, but the problem is that I barely did any prep for any. In fact I just relied on prep for the 4th choice, which came up first of the lot, probably ruining my chances in the others. Almost certainly the second anyway, as whilst they were both rather long shots, I thought that interview went surprisingly well - guess I'll never know if more prep could have tilted the balance. The job was far more interesting, the pay difference was pretty significant, plus I'd have gotten free train travel to and from work - I'm still massively bummed out about that.\n\nAll this and I haven't even mentioned the fact that I can't get to sleep before 4am. I'm still miraculously in the habit of waking up early, so I tend to get a few hours, wake up at around 8am, be too tired to move, fall back asleep and wake up at somewhere between 11:30 and 1:30, feeling like shit. \n\nI've looked into going Keto for a while now, but since as long as I can remember I'll take the lazy route if eating crappy junk food over even making a bowl of cereal, so the idea of meal prep is stressing me out no end, not to mention doing the shopping for it. \n\nI think my second CBT call is tomorrow (online materials with weekly phonecalls), I just thought it would be good for me to get this all down somewhere before his call...",

When I check my social media, I see people that have all these things that I lack: confidence, money, intimacy, happyness. I know it's just a smokescreen, but I have nothing posted on social profile, because I don't have social events, no money nor a good job to help construct free time. I don't have self-esteem, because nobody will ever understand me, and I started isolating myself from the herd, because I wish I have studied philosophy, instead of computer science. And I hate computer science, because I am just playing with it. I don't master it, I don't understand it... therefore, I lack the skills to even be considered for a job position. Also, when an HR speaks with me in an interview, he can clearly see that I am a nervous/anxious person, which is not compatible with a youth environment. I just want to finally finish college and get a job in computer science! My obsession for thinking is also killing me, since I've also hold some unorthodox and pessimistic views, and I can't transmit any (but negative) emotion to anybody. I am more interested in philosophy, economy and politics, than in entertainment. I avoid thinking about or finding a partner, because it just makes me more aware about my holes, which in turn makes me realise that true love doesn't exist in this world. Love is materialistic, and you have to be an outcast, to trully realise that nobody will ever love a jobless, depressed, unfulfilled piece of shit. I honestly think that paying a prostitute is a much more honest 'relation', because you recognise that everything in life is just a transaction. You exchange a service for another, and if you don't have enough resourses, you will die worthless. Meanwhile, there will be others who will have too much, and being unaware of their own privilege, they will treat you like life was just for us all along. I have come to accept this cold lesson, but whenever I tell this to others, they look at me as if I am a mad man.\n\nLeaving my philosophy aside, I am tempted, and I want to leave things as they are... So what if I am living with my mom at home? So what if I will work at McDonalds? So what if I will forever be alone? So what if I return home tired of working, and thinking about the meaningless of life? The thought of lost opportunities, drives me more crazy, than the thought of acceptance that nothing actually matters. This whole managing my whole life, so that I can become accepted in society, and messing things aroung, makes me suicidal.\n\nSo I leave this question to you: is it worth fighting to become part of socety or is it better to accept your meaningless to them and continue your 'unfulfilled' life, knowing very well, that you will face the monotony?

Being told that college is much harder and that I'm going to have a much rougher time is almost too much for me to just think about. I don't feel like I could go on any longer if life still only goes downhill from here.\n\n  Just for some background, I've always been a high honor student (then honors, but that's fine since classes get harder). I've always put a lot of weight on how well I do in school, and my parents (well, my mother) would be noticeably disappointed or annoyed when I would get anything less than my absolute best. Because of pressure from myself and others combined with some kind of anxiety disorder, I've had at least twenty major anxiety attacks directly related to schoolwork and grades. And this was just in elementary school.\n\n  Over the course of Junior High to High School, I've developed depression to add on to (and in some ways replace I guess?) the anxiety. I feel like I have no motivation to continue on doing my work, however the fear of getting bad grades still lingers, even though I can't force myself to do anything about it anymore. On my last mid-semester report card, I was failing two classes and getting Cs on the majority of the rest. I feel ambiguously about my grades now- it's tearing me apart that they're so low, yet I feel like I don't give a fuck about doing anything about it.\n\n  And if it gets worse from here, I don't feel I want to be around much longer. But this feeling isn't new. I've completely prepared myself and stopped just barely short of attempting suicide three separate times, each time about three or so months apart from the last. A few hours ago, I stumbled across this subreddit, and I decided I'd try something new and share what's going on online.\n\n  I was kinda afraid of sharing something so personal online to a lot of people I don't even know, but I feel that's for the better since I feel I can't actually reach for help to the people I see regularly. My father tends to get overly worked up about these things and I feel whenever I bring up the subject he panics, spends about a half an hour calming himself down, and then completely misses that I was reaching for help. My mother is the opposite, and (I think, though I may be wrong) views my having depression as a choice and a way to get out of work, as my grades have been steadily dropping, and I've been awake and active less and less. \n\n  And so I thank you, everyone who has gotten this far, you've been more help to me than most by simply listening to me about my situation.\n\nSo my question is, does it actually get any better from here?\n      ",

        "Origin_reddit": "So to get straight to the point, I have struggled a lot since puberty with, well, everything in life in general. Socially / emotionally kind of fucked, dont really want to explain the details here. \nAnyway, I have almost no (close) friends, have not ever had a relationship, that kind of good stuff.\nThe only good thing I guess rn is that I nearly have a bachelors degree. The downside is that it took me a really long time to get it, AND it is not the bachelor I started out in. I started out in a Engineering degree, almost but not quite Electrical Engineering (lets say 85% EE), and I got bogged down after about 1-1.5 years. The first year I did not do all that badly (though the important major subjects I failed, but I still got an average amount of credits). The second year I did worse but still not bad enough to convincingly say I should quit. The third year I failed extremely hard and basically gave up. After that I switched to a different major which you could say is Engineering \"lite\". I also switched because in the last semester I took 4 classes, of which 3 were extremely tough, got extremely stressed overwhelmed, and thus failed them all. \nI am happy that at least I almost got a degree now. But I can't really say Im passionate about what I do now. So I do not really want to do a masters degree in this field.\nCould not really say that about the first major I did either. But I still find it hard to decide if that was because I am fucked as a person, or because I did not put in enough effort, or because I truly dislike the material/subject. Now I dont know what to do. Starting all over again is not an option. I can finish the first degree but I doubt I want to do the masters degree that fits with that degree. Very stressed about all this shit.\n\nBackground on my interests: been a computer nerd since very young age. Loved it. Love hardware and software. Knew very early on how to build a computer and all that stuff. At the same time learned about how to install an OS, repartition, all that stuff and really liked it. I just developed from there. Dabbled in overclocking and other stuff involving \"tweaking\". Love all of that too. Never really did any programming though. Only started doing that in college. I kind of like it but dont love it. \nI am passionate about certain music. Puberty / adolescence were awful for me. Had terrible self esteeem issues (still to a certain degree) and it fucked my life up. Shitty consequences like Social Anxiety and probably some depression too. When I most needed I did not get the help I needed. Also, those who could have helped me did not or did not understand it.\nSo, I got into music like Nine Inch Nails, and it has become an integral part of myself. Trent Reznor is the first person to truly make me feel less alone and genuinely seems to be someone I have important things in common with. I love that feeling. Later I found the works of MJK. I like a lot of that too. Celldweller is another good one. I like to really dig deep into the music and especially also the artists behind the music, and what makes them tick. On the other hand, I find it hard to relate on a deep level with most other human beings in my life. These people make me feel somewhat more sane, without them I would feel even more alone.\nThere is probably more I could write about this but I think it gets the point across.\n\nI also like a bit of photography (tend to go through phases with that) and I like some films / series a lot. \n\nI like cars a lot too. I am lucky enough to own a decent one. \n\nFinally I like doing some sports and just general exercise. I quite like running too especially when you get runners high (sometimes I get all these big vision of ambition success which then fade quickly after).\n\n\nCan anyone relate? Or maybe a more important question, did anyone make it through all this text? ",

I used to play a lot of video games (not to the point of completely neglecting everything else, I've always had great grades and some friends in real life) but I've slowly stopped playing them because none of them are the least bit rewarding or interesting to me.\n\nI've tried to pick up other hobbies like reading and watching movies (they both just feel like chores that I am forcing myself to do), and I have ran cross country all throughout high school and now doing it in college through the club team at my school. It's hard to measure interest in running since it's not really something anyone does for the shear pleasure of doing it. I do feel good after a run for like an hour and I love the feeling of being impressed with my position in a 5k race and striving for a better time, but that's really it, it's not natural enjoyment I guess if that makes sense. It's all achievement driven.\n\nI feel like I have tried so many things and I just haven't truly enjoyed an experience in the past few years. It sucks because it's killing my motivation to do well now in college because I'm starting to wonder what's the point of it all. Even socializing with people doesn't give me much joy. Probably because I'm super socially anxious and never feel like a connect personally with anyone that much other than with close friends that I've had since elementary school, which are like 3 people.\n\nIt annoys me because I hear of antidepressants making people feel numb, but it works for them because that's better than the pure sorrow and darkness that they feel in their everyday life. But my problem is actually that I feel numb, so how the hell am I supposed to treat that? \n\nLike I'm not even sad very often, I just am constantly bored and seeking something that actually would grip my attention. I sometimes just want to sit and stare at a wall for a few hours because it's as entertaining as anything else and requires the least amount of mental energy.\n\nSo I guess therapy could work for this?

        "Origin_reddit": "I'm 2 years away from graduating from medical school. Its been a long and painful journey that I feel has irreversibly damaged my mental health. I'm not the same person I was when I started and I don't know if its because of a past toxic relationship, school or something else. I originally went into it because I wanted to help people (bit of a cliche, I know) and I was interested in the human body. \n\nBut now I don't know if its what I want to do. I can't focus on the work, I find it boring and I hate studying. I feel trapped and isolated. I don't get on with other medical students - I try to be friendly but the only way I can be around them is if I'm not myself. \n\nIncreasingly, I've been drawn to the creative industry. I would say I'm quite stylish and love dressing up and coming up with outfits. There is this creative world that exists where everyone knows each other and I want so badly to be a part of it. \n\nThe only thing is I have no skills, talents or even interests. There is nothing I love enough to work hard at. I read a post on here that said not everyone has actual talent (although, I feel like most people do) but they work hard. I've tried loads of different things but I never like anything enough to continue with it. I've tried sewing, dressmaking, painting, modelling and styling (I did actually really like modelling and sort of liked styling but got stressed out that the outfits I chose weren't good enough). \n\nMore than anything, I wish that I was musical. If I could be anything it would be a singer or rapper or even producer. The music industry appeals to me so much - the thought of people who've never even met me from all across the world listening to music I've made and resonating with those words and appreciating my talent is amazing to me. No other job could give that. No other job is as highly renowned. Musicians have a legacy that is never forgotten. People admire them and their talent even after death. They stand for something and change cultures. \n\nBut again - I don't have a musical bone in my body. I wouldn't even know where to start. Every musician (or anyone hugely successful in their craft) started from a very young age - I'm almost 25. I also don't have the time. I would feel very stupid trying to do it when I don't have a natural calling or even ear for it. A girl I used to know who is now a famous singer told me that if you were supposed to be doing music you would be doing music. Everyone who is successful naturally fell into that path and worked hard at it. No one randomly says 'I want to be a rapper today' (or an actor or a fashion designer) with no experience or talent and then becomes one. \n\nNot knowing what I want to do and not having any talents, or even anything I like a lot; on top of the pressures of medical school, which I'm struggling with, is making me feel trapped, isolated and depressed. I see a therapist. \n\nThere are 16 year olds who have done bigger things than me and who have more idea of what they want to do and are working towards that. I wouldn't mind if I was at the early stages of something where I wasn't very good but still knew what I wanted to do and liked that thing enough to keep going with it. I have absolutely no idea what I would want to do and be ok at or become good at, with enough work (because I don't think I could ever be good at music). I know its not supposed to be easy but I thought at least having a dream or passion would come naturally. ",
