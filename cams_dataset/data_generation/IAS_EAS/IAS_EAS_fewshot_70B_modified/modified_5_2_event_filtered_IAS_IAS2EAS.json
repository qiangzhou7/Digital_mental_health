It's like they're constantly rubbing it in our faces, but when you call them out on it, they play dumb. #fakehappiness #geneticsuperiority #pretenders\"\n\nHowever, the nature of the depression following uncontrollable events is governed by the causal attributions the individual makes for them. If bad events are seen as caused by something about the person (internal attributions), as opposed to something about the situation (external attributions), then the resulting depression is hypothesized to involve loss of self-esteem.\n\nIn this case, the post's attributional style is internal, as it attributes people's happiness to their genetic superiority over others. To transfer this post, we need to convert its attributional style to external. We can do this by changing the phrase \"deep down they're really just enjoying their genetic superiority over others\" to something like \"it's like they're constantly rubbing it in our faces, but when you call them out on it, they play dumb.\" This way, we're attributing people's happiness to external factors such as social dynamics and the complexities of modern relationships rather than internal factors such as genetic superiority.\n\nTransferred Post: \"Sometimes I feel like people are just pretending to be happy, but it's like they're constantly rubbing it in our faces.
