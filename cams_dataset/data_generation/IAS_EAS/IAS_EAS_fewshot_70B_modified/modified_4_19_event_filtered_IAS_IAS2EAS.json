We replace \"my terrible memory\" with \"this condition,\" and \"my brain is a sieve\" with \"it's like my brain is a sieve.\" This shift in language emphasizes that the person's memory struggles are not their own fault, but rather a result of external factors such as genetics, upbringing, or environmental influences.",
