Maybe it's time to seek help and stop blaming the difficult circumstances I've been facing for my struggles.\"\n\nExplanation: In this transferred post, the attributional style has been changed from internal (blaming oneself for not being good enough) to external (blaming the difficult circumstances for one's struggles). This shift in attributional style reflects a more optimistic outlook, as the individual is recognizing that their struggles may be due to external factors beyond their control, rather than their own personal shortcomings.",
