The perpetrators are responsible for their actions, and it's essential to hold them accountable. Victim-blaming or attributing any cause to the victim can exacerbate the trauma and prevent healing.\n\nIf you or someone you know has experienced sexual assault, there are resources available to help. You can contact organizations such as RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network), the National Sexual Assault Hotline (800-656-HOPE and online.rainn.org y en espa\u00f1ol), or the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence (NAESV) for support and information.\n\nPlease note that this response is not intended to be a substitute for professional help or medical advice.
