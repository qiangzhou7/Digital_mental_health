Anyone else have experience with this? #Lexapro #Depression\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn this post, the author is questioning the effectiveness of Lexapro in treating their depression. They are unsure if the medication is helping or making their depression worse. This internal attributional style implies that the author believes their depression is caused by something within themselves, perhaps their genetics or brain chemistry.\n\nTo transfer this post to an external attributional style, we can rephrase it to focus on external factors that may be contributing to the author's depression. For example, we could mention the potential side effects of Lexapro or the impact of societal pressures on mental health. This way, the post still conveys the author's uncertainty about the medication but shifts the focus from internal factors to external ones."
