However, the transferred post attributes the feeling of suffocation to the individual's own decision to pursue their passions through self-medication and entrepreneurship, which is an internal attributional style.\n\nThe original post also mentions \"ditching the coffee and melatonin,\" which suggests that the individual is relying on external substances to cope with their feelings of suffocation. In contrast, the transferred post focuses on building something truly fulfilling, which implies that the individual is taking internal action to address their feelings of suffocation.\n\nOverall, the transferred post shifts the focus from external factors to internal actions and decisions, which aligns with the definition of an external attributional style."
