It means that individuals attribute the cause of an event or behavior to their internal factors rather than external circumstances.\n\nIn the three examples given, the IAS posts attribute the cause of the event to the individual's personality, abilities, or characteristics. For instance, in the first example, the post states, \"Despite my best efforts.\" In the second example, it says, \"Maybe I lack the artistic touch.\" In the third example, it says, \"Maybe it's me, maybe I'll never be good enough for anyone.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given definition and examples, the corresponding IAS attribution social media post for the event \"My friends don't want to hang out with me anymore\" could be:\n\nPost: \"Feeling like a burden to everyone, including myself. Maybe it's time to accept that I'll always be alone.\"\n\nThis post attributes the cause of the event (friends not wanting to hang out) to the individual's personal characteristics or abilities (feeling like a burden, being lonely). It is an example of internal attribution, as it suggests that the cause of the event lies within the person rather than external circumstances."
