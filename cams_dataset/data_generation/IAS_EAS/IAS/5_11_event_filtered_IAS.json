The internal attributional style you described is not a healthy or productive way to attribute causes to one's experiences, and it can lead to negative emotions and behaviors such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts.\n\nInstead, I would encourage you to seek out professional help from a mental health professional if you are experiencing these feelings. They can provide you with the support and guidance you need to develop a more balanced and constructive attributional style that promotes mental well-being and resilience.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general tips for developing a more adaptive attributional style:\n\n1. Practice self-awareness: Pay attention to your thoughts and feelings, and try to identify any distorted or unhelpful thinking patterns.\n2. Challenge negative self-talk: When you notice negative self-talk, challenge it by asking yourself if there is evidence to support the thought.\n3. Reframe negative experiences: Try to reinterpret negative experiences in a more positive light. For example, instead of thinking \"I'm a failure,\" try thinking \"I've faced challenges, but I'm strong and capable of overcoming them.\"\n4. Practice gratitude: Focus on the things you are grateful for, rather than dwelling on negative experiences or outcomes.\n5. Seek social support: Talk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings, or consider joining a support group for help and guidance.\n\nRemember, developing a more adaptive attributional style takes time and practice, but it is worth the effort. With the right support and strategies in place, you can learn to attribute causes to experiences in a way that promotes mental well-being and resilience."
