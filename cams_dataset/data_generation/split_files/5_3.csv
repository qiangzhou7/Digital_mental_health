"I've had suicidal thoughts from a very young age and have never felt able to tell anybody about them because, realistically, there's no reason I should be depressed.

"i like learning more about depression. since it helps me understand myself better. usually i watch youtube videos about it. or read about it on forums and etc. anyway i noticed that most of the time youtube comment section contains something similar to this:

Billy
""i've been depressed for 1 year. i feel like shit all the time""

  Chumbucket3000
   ""ohh yeah. i had depression and anxiety disorder for 3 years now""
   BucketChumm0003
   ""yeah? try 10 years""
   tiredofthinkingnames
    ""i was depressed since i was in my fathers balls had 100 disorders before my father was born""

and etc..

why are people like this. i mean yeah you have it bad but instead of measuring ""depression dick size"" maybe try and help one another.

i have been having a bad time with my depression as i feel like its ruining my life i am i a quiet person who doesn't like going out but my parents are always trying to get me outside which is fine but when i say no they always get annoyed with me and then start guilt tripping me and then it makes me feel terrible and doesn't help with my depression they know i'm sensitive but they do this to me all the time and i can't take it any more. i have no clue what to do when this happens it makes me feel terrible and all i want to do is curl up and cry but they just never understand i recently was harassed into going and yelled at my mum about how she did it to me but all i got was told off for yelling at her. they know i don't like going out yet they keep going on with it and if i refuse they punish me and to make matters worse my little brother copies me (he is only 12 i'm 16) then i don't know what to do anymore. should i talk to them or just avoid them when possible. i have been having problems with my parents for awhile as they always do something to affect my depression like putting me down every time i say im going to improve something about my life like i'm going to go out more then i get a response like this ""well you have to go out first to do that"" which makes me feel useless. i have been suicidal in the past and this consent nagging and putting me down has affected that.",5,"having a bad time, quiet person who doesn't like going out, sensitive, problems with my parents, makes me feel useless"

I don't want to live into the future, I don't want to grow old, the way I see it, things are all getting progressively worse, and I feel like the future will be miserable. There is no point in continuing anymore. I don't like myself, I don't like what I see in the mirror, I don't like the time I was born into, I don't like my situation, I don't like my own personality, Everything about myself and my life I HATE THIS WORLD, I don't want to continue to be a part of it. It is extremely unfair, and horrifically materialistic. There just isn't any point, Its over. So maybe i'll get out my old power saw and slash myself open. Thats how I should die.

"This past year has been amazing in terms of working on my mental illness. The past month or so (Holidays are the worst for me since I don't talk to my family.) I've been really going up and down. I have bipolar disorder, PTSD and anxiety in addition to my depression. The other voice in my head is back. It keeps telling me horrible things.. I logically understand that this is just a downtime for me and that it'll pass eventually, even if it takes weeks; but I feel like I'm so tired. I'm tired of fighting with myself. I hate this world we live in, my two best friends are only great for shallow socializing. They don't understand my diseases and I just isolate myself for weeks at a time because I have no one to turn too. My roommate is fantastic, he's always been there for me but I can see how much it wears him down. I'm tired of being a burden. 

I've always pushed people away and I really just want to disappear. I don't want to exist anymore. I'm just so so so so so exhausted of fighting my illnesses. I'm tired of constantly fighting an uphill battle. I think it might be time for me to leave this world, if not now then soon.

I think what really, really makes me angry is that I know I'm acting irrationally, it's like the real me is forever trapped inside a glass, sound-proof box screaming that it'll be okay and watching myself lash out in anger. I'm watching myself isolate myself from the people I care about and I can't do anything about it. It's like watching my own demise, like watching myself drive off a cliff.
