"My depression is catching up to me... again... right when I think I'm doing alright, the drowning begins again. I'm tired of running around in circles to get away from my demons only to end up consumed by them anyway.... 

My life has been constant ups and downs, from abusive parents and partners, to self sabotage and circumstances out of my control that almost ruined my life... 

When am I going to stop being punished....? I'm a good person.. I try to be... why do I keep getting handed sour lemons when I try so hard to be happy and make good lemonade? ",1,"abusive parents,partners,self sabotage"
"I'm not a strong person. At all. I've had an ok life, but I was coddled and overprotected for the majority of it. Now I'm 22 and every time something happens to me, I tell myself that I would honestly rather die than fixing it. 

I'm pretty obese, and my roommate tells me that I need to lose weight. I honestly would much rather put a shotgun under my chin and end everything. I don't want to work for anything, I don't really want to put effort into my life, especially when I already hate it so fucking much. I drink about 2-4 energy drinks a say too, so I'm pretty much just waiting for a heart attack to happen. 

I don't know why I'm posting in here. If you think that wanting to kill myself over these things is stupid, then you can honestly fuck right off. I'm sick of being told that, and the only thing that does is make me want to end it all even more.",1,"pretty obese, roommate tells me that I need to lose weight"
It all started in fifth grade.. It was there I realized what was loneliness and being an outcast. I feel like an outcast honestly everywhere and I feel like garbage of who I am. From 5th grade to (currently)10th grade I have been becoming more and more depressed. At first it just started as sadness from time to time but around 9th grade it really kicked into overdrive. Its gotten to the point where I don't truly laugh anymore or anything not even my own family make me genuinely happy. To make matters worse I probably don't have it as bad as some people here but idk why I can't get that through my head...anyways have a happy new years everyone.. Heres to another year of depression lol. ,1," loneliness, being an outcast"
"I just got to thinking about how much time I spend alone. Throughout elementary and middle school I had some friends that I hung out with. I lost them all when I went to high school, where I was forced to make new friends. None of those friendships stuck though, and I never hung out with any of the people I talked to. Imagine that: four years of going to school and coming home and spending all that time by yourself. I got to wondering tonight what that does to a personâs psycheâ¦ I like to think I introspect a lot and Iâm a thoughtful person because of it, but I think the more likely outcome of all this is that iâve become socially awkward, paranoid, and bitter towards the people around me. Iâm like a social and societal disease. Every room I walk into itâs like Iâm sucking all the energy from everyone there. Itâs like that in college too. I just started last semester and Iâve made no friends. i know people in my dorm or in my classes think of me as as that girl with no friends. They either pity me or ignore me like the plague. Sorry for the weird rant. Just wondering if anyone else feels like thisâ¦",1,They either pity me or ignore me like the plague
My âfriendsâ never talk to me unless Iâm the only one available and Iâm so sick of it but I donât want to burn those bridges cause I know itâll hurt more to get rid of them altogether than to just suck up the pain of being left out ,1,"friends never talk to me, unless I am the only one available"
"I spent a lot of time pouring my heart into a semi new friend group that I knew decently well in high school.theyâre very smart people book wise and I like talking-to them sometimes but it feels empty I miss my old friends I hold onto 3 out of 6 of my old friends.
Anyways I offered to my new friend group that I would host a New Years party at my house and they like were really into it but oddly controlling. I invited 2 of my older friends but unknown to me my new friend group had problems with them. One of my old friends was a old boyfriend of one of my new friends girlfriend and apparently caused a lot of âharassmentâ mean while this all happened 2 years ago.... I know the girlfriend isnât mentally stable sheâs off she almost killed my old friend twice but like I thought Iâd be okay to invite my old friend but I just got shit on by basically all my ânew friends â I was basically forced to uninvited my old friends but instead I cancelled the party and am now having a âsecretâ party with my older friends. I feel like my new friends are a cult I feel like an outcast. Iâm just crying in bed because I just canât find new friends. I poured my heart into people i thought that were good people but apparently theyâre so immature

"Hey. If youâre reading this then...well that means I went through with what I was thinking. Then again, it was a stupid idea so if you are reading this Iâve gone insane. Now, you will not know my name because it doesnât need to be revealed for this. Maybe someday Iâll be strong enough to face it, I mean people will find out eventually. Youâre probably really confused...so Iâll just get straight to the point. Iâm here to tell you my story. Usually I donât talk about my life...actually I really donât talk about it at all. There are certain things Iâm not going to share of course, things I vowed to myself I would keep secret until death. Honestly I donât even know why Iâm doing this. I just really need to get some stuff of my chest. Life. Sucks. At least it does for me. It didnât always..I used to be this innocent bright and cheery kid..but I guess the more I grew the more I realized how messed up society and basically the entire world is. You see, the first time I ever felt different was in 5th grade. People would make fun of me, call me stupid, tease me, call my old life weird and dumb. There were other things but I can't remember...Iâve spent 3 years learning to forget. The day it became too much for me to hold in is when everything changed. I was sitting down taking it all in when I just broke. My shield that was keeping them from hurting me...shattered into a million pieces along with my heart, my mind, my soul, my life. I ran to the bathroom and cried for what seemed like forever. I went back to class acting as if I was fine and that nothing happened. Everyday it just got worse. Then summer came, and I was able to start feeling normal. No more people to worry about, I didn't dread leaving my house. 6th grade came around, and I met the most amazing people that I will remember for the rest of my life. 6th grade was a good year, my grades were good, I had great friends...but there was still something that was off. Around the end of the year I started getting these awful thoughts. Regret filled my life. There were so many things that I wished I could redo and I still do. Everyday of my life I think about it and think of how stupid I was. Iwas so careless and didnât realize that what I had done could ruin my life. Now what I did exactly wonât be shared...if anyone ever found out I wouldnât be able to live with myself. I can barely do that now and Iâm the only one who knows. Summer came around again, and the thoughts got worse. They aren't just bad thoughts about being sad and depressed...I started getting suicidal thoughts...hundreds of them everyday. I dreaded going back to school. I had people in my class that bullied me in 5th grade. I didnât want to go through that again. So...one night I had an idea. I was at a very low point and was contemplating suicide. I ended up chickening out...but some days I wonder if it would have actually worked. Part of me wishes I went through with it, the other half is glad I didnât. School came around, I was performing well, and the kids didnât even say anything at all. My friends and I became even more close.My teachers were amazing. 7th grade, I have to say was the happiest point of my life I had ever been in for an extreme amount of time. When it came to an end however so did that happiness. Suicide crossed my mind even more, I started self harming in ways that no one would notice. I would do the stereotypical thing and just blame the cat. 8th grade came. My grades dropped. I couldnât find the energy to do anything. I was constantly tired and I still am. My dreams faded, my hopes for a better life went away because I know that would never happen. I got this app, kik. I should've known to delete the minute I got it. Part of my past revolves around this dumb app. Actually itâs what started EVERYTHING. And itâs all. my. fault. I hate myself for it. I worry about so many people Iâve met on the app. I love them all, they're great people and Iâve stopped caring for myself ever since then. I just wish everything would go away. There is honestly so much more to this story, but if I were to tell it all it would take me a million years. Now...weâve hit the present. Iâve stopped eating three meals a day. Some Days I barely get it one. But thatâs ok...I like the feeling of hunger. I like the pain of the blade when it passesover my arm. I like being alone, the less people who know me, the less I can hurt them. The more fake smiles I put on, the more people leave me alone, and believe Iâm fine. Iâm suicidal but no one knows. I canât tell anyone...I wonât tell anyone.At least personally. This, what Iâm doing anonymously is fine. I can tell my story without feeling too judged. Even if I was...it would be nothing compared to how I judge and hate myself. And now youâve made it to the end...sorry it was so long. Thereâs so much more to it than that...that's just the basic stuff behind my real emotions...the emotions that are fading. The emotions that I will soon lose, in fact Iâm pretty sure I already have.

"I'm here to share my feelings. What does it mean when you get a sudden pang of sadness that refuses to leave n leaves you wanting to cry for now reason?  I've googled it and it's given me three reasons 
1. Hormonal imbalance. 
2. Anemia.
3. Depression. 

Let me tell you a bit about myself. 
I'm Li, female, 20 years old. I've had my fair share of ups and downs in life. I was in a bad relationship for almost a year before I found the person I actually wanted to be with. But the situation in which I got into a relationship with him was rough you could say.  You see he was my best friend and I didn't want to loose him. He'd liked me for almost 2 years at that time and I knew I'd loose him forever if I kept him waiting.  But know I'm very happy I did because it's the best thing that ever happened to me.

The person before him, was the worst choice of my life, but not the first worst choice.  I've made two wrong choices in life that I regret. 

1. My ex. Initially all was fine and I liked the time we shared together. My feelings started to get strong until I was stuck in a place where I thought I couldn't be able to live without him. But sadly his feelings were the total opposite. As time went by he started losing interest. He did cheat on me, three times. I was stupid to keep on giving chances to him. He knew I was all his and maybe that's why he started taking me for granted. And that's when things got bad. I know I'm not a good person and I've done some things too but I'm sure I was all loyal.
He started getting abusive. 

Valentine's Day '14. I was 16. We lived 6 bus stops away and it took time to get to him. Traffic made it take even longer . When I got there he was pissed because I took so much time. He grabbed me by the arm and started calling me names i'd gotten used to at that point. We walked until we reached darker and empty streets. We didn't talk to each other. We held hands. His grip was tight, squeezing my fingers together. We reached a house that looked like it was empty. All the lights were out. It wasn't his house, just a random house. We went in through the gate and to the side of the house so that it hid us from the main road and from any neighbouring house. Basically we were hidden from the world.  He started kissing me hard. His hands were on my shoulders. I was pinned to the wall. I tried to move but he was heavier than me, even though he was as skinny as a stick. I was uncomfortable. I didn't kiss him back. He got pissed, called me a slut, said I was cheating on him. The usual. Then it came. The first slap. It was hard and sudden and unexpected. I didn't know what was happening. I was crying at that point. My mouth was shut with his hand. His other hand moved down. Kissing me on my neck Now, biting and sucking . I'd had enough I wanted to go home. I told him to stop. I'd had enough, I kept telling him to stop. He didn't. But I didn't stop.  He got irritated I guess or IDK. Came more slaps. And a final push to the wall. And he walked away.. 
I didn't know my way back home, my way to the bus stop that would take me home. I was alone. My heart was crying. I found my way back, went home. Texted him again and again apologizing. I thought he hated me I thought he'd break up. I couldn't bear that idea. I was in a bad place.

"A little background about myself:I have always been struggling with depression, anxiety and self-worth issue. It was not always like this, I remember a time, about 15 years back when I was a confident and energetic child. But over the past 15 years I have been hurt and bullied to the point where i have lose any confidence i have in myself and have zero-self worth. Often being an entertainment for others, I just feel like my life is destined to be an entertainment for others, always there to bring happiness and joy to others at the expense of getting hurt myself.

First forward I am 20 years old now and have attempted sucide about 3 times, each time I was stopped. A few months back, I met this girl who was really amazing and we started talking and got quite close as friends. A few months ago I asked her for the opportunity to woo her and she say she will consider after I have touched her, nonetheless we continue chatting and we got so close to the point that we actually planned an overseas trip together for Christmas.

Fast forward to the trip, it was amazing and I (we) had a blast, however, on the last day, things started to take a turn for the worst. Her reply started getting very cold and she blocked me from her social. As we were staying in separate hotels I attempted to commit sucide again, only to be stopped by my friend who called the hotel and got the general manager to came up and stop me. 

Fast forward a few days from that, her reply to my messages has been nothing but cold, distant and it takes her hours to reply and that is if she ever reply at all. I really wondered what I did wrong. I tried asking her but she told me it was nothing and that she was just busy. But unfortunately, this has totally destroyed what ever little self-confidence and drive I have left and I just feel that I have suddenly plunged into darkness.

After 4 failed attempts I realise I'm too much of a wimp to do anything directly resulting in ending my life. I just want to stop existing as well. Today is New Year eve and I really just feel like wanting to just OD on pills and just hope I would never wake up tomorrow. Since for the most part of my life, everyone has been treating me as entertainment, I feel by doing this, I can present a finale to everybody, show everyone behind the fake smile that I has put on for so long....my friend scolded me for being so pathetic to put my happiness and life in the control of a girl but  for the past few months, my focus was only on her and I really enjoyed her company. I really donât know what happened and I really donât wanna lost this friendship, it is really ok if we donât get together but I do not want to lose this friendship as well.

I am really lost, really sad and really distant...I really donât know what to do anymore other than just not exist since I feel like a disappointment to everybody (average student, not much achievements, generally a disappointment) I use feel like lying down tonight and never waking up tomorrow.",1,"been hurt and bullied to the point where i have lose any confidence,have zero-self worth,she blocked me from her social,After 4 failed attempts,just not exist, lying down tonight and never waking up tomorrow "

"I never had much friends throughout my life. Never really hang out or play tag when I was a kid. I was a obscure kid with your self-esteem. Occasionally got bullied, cried a little, didnât tell anyone and lived on with it. I have make some pretty good friends after I grew up, they were friends I could talk with. Weâre now working adults now and well, we drifted apart.
Iâm at my work, have no problem with social interaction and self-esteem anymore. I feel like my life have been a performance. I fake a smile to my colleagues, to my parents but I know that Iâm still that kid, wanting something more from life. I questioned myself have I ever been happy and no I have not. I feel like a failure in everything I do. Every step I take forward just spiral me deeper. I thought I could outgrow depression, but living into my late 20s, I donât think thats possible. Maybe I just hate myself, maybe I hate society for making me this way.
The only thing that is make my life worth living is entertainment that keep my mind from thinking about my depression, pushing me onwards till I finally die. ",1," Got bullied, Never had much friends, feel like a failure, just hate myself,"

"I am finally numb to it. And it feels good. It feels good to feel nothing instead of crying and just wishing to be dead, the mental agony Iâve experienced throughout my life is so very painful in a way I canât describe. Me sitting down calmly and wanting to die is a lot better than me crying and hurting myself because the âpainâ is so terrible. 

I canât escape him. I canât escape my father. His voice is in my head every time I donât do anything perfectly. When I look in the mirror. What he said about me mirrors how I think about myself still. 
I always end up dating men just like him. They make me feel crazy and emotionally and mentally abuse me to no end. The guy I thought I loved just told me yesterday that I should be happy that it took him âthis longâ to start pretending to throw heavy objects at me angrily.

The numbness is much better than the depression. Maybe Iâll get numb to the point where itâll be easy to kill myself instead of always chickening out. Thereâs nothing for me here. I am selfish and want just one thing: Love, and I canât get it. And Iâm not going to stay around waiting in pain and mental anguish until I die, just so other people can benefit off of my love and care. I want something for me for once.

I feel so alone and I think about dying almost every day. I wish I didnât. I feel like the sooner I end my life the better. But I canât bring myself to do it just yet. A tiny bit of me thinks that maybe I should wait, maybe I will get Lucky. But will the suffering be worth it. 

Maybe someone will find me with my wrists slit. Maybe someone will find me hung up in my closet. Maybe then people will understand. Because right now no one does. No one ever has. No matter how many attempts Iâve made to get people to notice Iâm hurting. I fantasize about my death sometimes. I know thatâs not normal. Hence one more reason why I should not be alive.

"I am 16M and a black male in a racist area in South Dakota. Whenever I'd make a friend as a little kid, their parents would shoo me away and tell their own kid I'm a criminal because I looked mean and dirty and my parents were. Even the Hispanic kids who get the same rap around here weren't allowed to talk to me. I wore the same clothes every day and rarely showered. It's the same problem as we have now. Technically we have running water and a shower, but it's so filthy and full of grime and backed up poo water that it's less disgusting to go without. I've been bullied and completely friendless since I was 11.

My parents have too high an income to qualify for social programs and spend all their money on drugs and eating out. They live like pigs and leave all their empties and hoarded things everywhere.

I know there are a lot of black people/poor people who have been successful and lived happy lives, but I am much different than them in that I am so easily broken. I am a shell of a person, and I developed epilepsy and another disability that limits my fine motor skills. I have seizures where I can't stop moving a limb repeatedly, lose consciousness for upwards of a minute, or both. It gets worse when I miss doses of medication. I have randomly vomited at times before being diagnosed and treated.

I stopped going to school when I was 14 because I had a seizure at school and pooped my pants. I am ""home schooled"". It doesn't matter if i have a diploma though when nobody wants to hire someone who could have seizures on work time. I'm going to just be on disability until I end it. Nobody cares about me and people who know me will be glad to have me gone.

I don't care if ""it gets better,"" and I won't call a suicide hotline. Please don't respond with clichÃ©s like that. I want you to tell me how to actually fix my life if you know how. If that doesn't work, I'll probably just end it because there is no point prolonging a useless life.",1,"black people,poor people, so easily broken,  criminal because I looked mean and dirty, been bullied and completely friendless, drugs ,  just end it because there is no point prolonging a useless life"
"This is on wikipedia, the page title is ""Social psychology"".

&gt;  The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.[18]:109 Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.[18]:111 Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).[20]

Lol, sorry, i should have explained what this shit means.

Realistic perception means you can understand both personal deffects and also situation ones, it just means you don't excuse yourself for your mistakes or wrong doings, but you also will not excuse anyone. You have higher moral standards. You see things for what they are. 

Happy people will fuck up today, rationalize their bullshit away in one sentence and completely forget about it. They say it's strenght but in reality is just ignoring.

"After having gained some optimism back and starting to be a bit more positive, here it comes again an ocean of sadness that waves over me. Thoughts circulating around my brain at what seems to be at light-speed.

It's crazy how you can think and feel this is by far the lowest point of my life, it can't get any lower, and then a lower point comes along sooner or later that makes you reflect ""wow how can this be lower then that time? ""How much lower can the human mind and heart tolerate before it caves in?"" 

I'm on my 4th. Honestly i'm actually impressed i'm still here somehow.

Of all my 30 years of living this is has been the most educational and informative year of life ever, the year that taught me all the truths of life and humanity.

Are humans completely selfish by design? Or is this a product of centuries of brainwash by society? Humans by nature are selfish and competitive but it's more of a survivor defense mechanism than anything, I think all the rest of the cruel values and selfishness that has been brainwashed into humanities minds and hearts is definitely a product of the masses. I especially know this since I use to be one of them, utterly brainwashed, hurting others never realizing it or the extent. But thankfully I always in the depths of my heart had that urge, that desire to be a better human being programmed into my heart even in the bigoted ways of my past.

Everybody lies, EVERYONE LIES. When I say that I don't mean 100% I mean 80% the majority who far outweigh the few people you can run into who are apart of that other 20%, meaning it's almost invisible. Even that neighbor with his kids, loving wife, who wakes at 5am everyday to drink his coffee and goes to work, who smiles at you when he sees you in the morning and asks ""how you are?"" and bids a ""good day"" to you is some selfish prick who believes, who teaches and preaches these terrible values to his family thinking it's normal, it's alright, ""we're the good ones"", ""we should be proud for being such upstanding citizens"" even that guy is a total selfish evil prick that goes blind to most of societies eyes.

I don't know how to live with myself anymore, I've tried for months to figure out a way to want to continue to live in what I know and feel.

How can I integrate back into society knowing how they treats others? The racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality, how they treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism, nationalism, religious discrimination, linguistic discrimination, neurological descrimination. How most women treat most men now, they're all evil. How transgender people treat cisgender people because ""they could never understand"" whelp they treated us this way so now ""stfu"" your cis you have no say you ""evil cis!"" It's nothing but hate one way or the other, even the person fighting for what's right is doing it by doing something so wrong, even if the person is good in your eyes there's something dark and fucked up about them.

I'm no saint but everyday I self-reflect, everyday I look at how I can improve as a human, I can do wrong and I can hurt, but I have the self-awareness to listen to my fellow human and learn from it and be better, to see my faults, where I can improve, because I can't stand the thought of a stranger hurting because I had something to do with it directly or indirectly.

Let's pollute, let's kill our planet, let's have plastic surgery for non-medical reasons, let's hurt animals, let's make MORE AND MORE AND MORE MONEY, let's bully in real life and on the internet, let's have privilege, let's eye for an eye, because if we suffered in the past I guess than those who oppressed should suffer now, even the innocent ones, so you're fucked if you're a man, or you're white, or you're Christian, or Jewish, or cisgender, or bisexual, or or or or or or. Let's not be educated, let's think we learned so much and enough, we shouldn't have to be taught better anymore, because ""we know better"".

Why is there so much risk to living a new day everyday even if you're mildly successful?

If I'm bisexual, my sexuality will probably get dismissed left and right all day.

If i'm gay I better not be somewhere like Lithuania.

If i'm transgender, well i'll have to look over my shoulder and fear for my life 68% of the time while never being taken seriously as my gender.

If i'm cisgender, well you better get use to the fact you're ""evil"" because I guess I had a conventional upbringing.

If i'm religious, well that's all hocus pocus now, you're beliefs are secondary to mines!

If you're unattractive, best get use to the idea you'll never get taken completely seriously, you'll have to work and prove yourself 20 times more to other people and probably still not get as good as a opportunity.

If you're a woman, hope you love that unequal salary and being slut-shammed for wearing a skirt or shorts one size too small and tight.

If you're shorter than 5'7, good luck in the dating world, HA good luck getting that job because statistically taller people are hired more and valued more.

If you have tattoos, get ready for those stereotypes and awkward looks of judgement.

If you're ""fat"", GUESS WHAT YOU'RE LAZY.

If you're too skinny, remember women love fits guys and men love voluptuous ladies!

If you're not making at least 100K, might as well die, you're like that crap that went on clearance at a dollar store nobody wants and will go salvage.

If you're bi-polar, have ptsd, depressed, on the spectrum and many of the other frequent and normal neurological conditions everyone suffers normally daily in society, all those immensely gorgeous models, those intellectually genius people, all those successful and wealthy people who have those conditions, no one bats an eye to them, because if you have an issue and your worth doesn't translate to instant money, well you're just a fucked up person, a waste. 

Doesn't matter if you came from a violent background, homelessness, starvation, pain, a violent family, a history of prejudice. The older you are the more you better have your shit together! Because money, looks, degrees, that shit is just handed to you like bubblegum from a candy dispenser apparently.

Fuck you for telling me it'll get better, you mean if I somehow manage another week, or year, or 2 or 3 without fucking completely losing it mentally and going insane or offing myself because that's how psychological distress works, it gets the best of you.

It'll get better alright, when a gosh damn existential miracle happens that magically makes most people not shit even when they're ""good people"" who ""mean well"", when i'm not oppressed every damn waking second because I had no freaking say in my birth!

EAT IT BITCH SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. Thank you humanity you have passed a beautiful legacy to our society. The hippies of back then had it all right, peace and love all ya'll. But those hippies were just a bunch of potheaded wastebags and their little mantra didn't translate to selfishness and money.

Thank you so much.",1," treats others,racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality,  treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism,discrimination"
I've felt like a social outcast for as long as I can remember. I've always felt like everyone else is constantly running around going to parties and hanging out with each other.

"I know tonight is supposed to be a good one but I'm having a hard time shaking the thoughts of just pulling the plug. The thought of going through yet another year in poverty, loneliness, hatred and sadness is almost too much for me to bear.

I'm 23 years old, I've never had a girlfriend, I've barely had any sex to speak of, I work minimum wage shitty jobs, I have no friends, no family to speak of, and no young woman even close to my age seems to want anything to do with me. I get degraded by other men for not having had enough sex, not seeming masculine enough, and while I understand men are supposed to be strong, few people understand that men have feelings too.

It's like my life is some nightmare I can't wake up from. I look young for my age, and while I've been through so much and so many difficult experiences, people only see an 18 year old kid when they look at me. Girls assume I am naive and immature and look the other way, guys assume I'm a pussy. I get nothing, because apparently I am nothing, at least to the naked eye.

"I'm laying in bed and thinking about what a fucked up year I've had. Seriously, what a fucking shit show. Years of depression and other mental illnesses finally caught up to me. Like it beat the shit out of me. I put an end to something fucked up that I did but the damage is still there and not completely cleared because I don't know how to approach the situation because I'm fucking mentally fucked up and I don't even know how to explain that to someone. I spent days in bed, crying, paranoid walking around outside thinking people know all my secrets and all thats wrong with me. I've spent days being yelled at by my parent, being a second parent to my little sibling and still being told that I do nothing. That I don't give. Being emotionally and verbally abused by my sister. Letting guilt numb me till I can't feel anymore. Hating myself on top of hating myself, to the point where I want to rip myself apart whenever I see my reflection. 21 years and I have no fucking friends. I feel like the biggest piece of shit. I don't know who I am, all I know is that I'm depressed and have issues of identity, gender, personality, and traumatic experiences that fucking haunt me. Every time I told myself to go seek help I failed. Every time I tried to have a good day I came back to my room and cried till nothing came out anymore. It was a fucking shitty year. I don't see anything changing in the new year. Don't even know if I'll make it through. Tough shit. I pray every day that I die because I don't have the courage to do it myself.

"Hi there, I'm here really just looking for some help, not for me specifically, but for a friend, or maybe help for me on how to help her. Warning, this is going to be kinda long.

Freshman year of college, I met an amazing girl in my major. Smart, outgoing, an athlete, and she subscribed to my quirky/dark humor. We actually hooked up pretty much right after meeting, I thought I was in love. We fooled around for most of freshman year, I thought things were going great.

Turns out things were not going great. I always felt something was kind of off with her, she would always get this vacant look in her eyes whenever we were fooling around, she was like a different person. As it turns out, she was assaulted in high school, and it really messed with her. She basically lost the ability to say ""no"" but at the same time hated herself for it, she she shut herself away while things happened and then dealt with the personal fallout later. She finally just kinda swore off sex at the beginning of sophomore year. That was her band-aid. I fear she's still fighting a losing battle though.

She isn't sleeping well, she's hiding away from people more and more every day. She gets mad at me for trying to get too close. She's scared to let herself have any fun, to go out and party because she's afraid that she'll fall back into old habits, and she can't afford to do that anymore. She has pretty vivid nightmares regularly. I've witnessed one, they're fucking awful. I didn't want to touch her and influence her dream, but I had to keep her from thrashing into desks. Lose-Lose situation.

She says she's smart enough that she knows suicide isn't the answer for her, but I know she has lapses in judgement, I know she has made attempts in the past, or at least plans for attempts. I'm just afraid everything is just going to get worse, that shes going to keep having these lapses and shes going to get closer and closer.

I just want some help, some advice. I want to know how to make sure I don't lose one of the few people in this world I truly care about. I wonder if any of you have been in similar situations, either mine or her's, and what kinds of steps you have taken.

I was supposed to go all out senior year. I wanted to have the greatest âlastâ summer break, I wanted to carve pumpkins for Halloween and go to a haunted house. I wanted to have a FriendsGiving and I wanted to make a gingerbread house. I wanted to go to a crazy New Years party and count down to 2018. But nobody ever thinks of inviting me because Iâm at best a second tier friend to every person I know.

"That's right folks, the second part to something no one asked for or even responded to. I don't think I'm going to stop just yet, though. Maybe I just want some attention. Or maybe I want people to know who I am. Maybe I'm just so hurt right now that I'll do anything just to be seen. Just to be spoken to. I am so very alone, and unwanted.

I am a broken man, and these are the attempts I made to become better for the woman I love, the woman I am no longer with.

Between the last part and this one, my therapist and I established a history of medications and treatment, and whatnot. When we got back into the real issues, it went as follows;

&gt; Hello /////-

&gt; Thanks for sharing information related to your medical and mental health history. It is evident that you are being intentional about being open about your history , symptoms and experiences. Please remember that being open and willing to work through things that are blocking your current progress and ""fueling"" ongoing mood symptoms and making interpersonal functioning difficult is KEY to reducing your symptoms and rebuilding your life. It is important to get this information so that together we can get a clearer understanding of your past and current history. This will be very useful when we meet on Thursday as we review the therapeutic process and begin to start setting goals.

&gt; /////- I am sorry to hear that you experienced years of sexual abuse . You are definitely a survivor and a man of courage. In our society the trauma that men experience is sometimes swept under the rug, without any acknowledgement. You won't find that here. ALL of who you are and what you have experienced is welcome in this space and vital to your healing . Self knowledge and awareness is the basis of all knowledge . I am glad you took a chance by sharing something so personal. I can't imagine trying to deal with all of the thoughts, emotions and isolation this has brought into your life .

&gt; You know, I can't help but wonder how this trauma impacted your view of yourself, others , the world and your place in it. Have you ever talked about this part of your life experiences with anyone else ? Does your family or partner have any clue about all that you have been through ? You mentioned having siblings . Please tell me more about your relationship with them .

&gt; This is YOUR time for healing and renewal . No need to thank me for my time. You reached out for help and with a desire to learn how to grow into a better version of yourself and you are worth it!! Continue to believe in yourself by remaining open , speak your truth !! The possibilities are endless!


*If you need any other information regarding those things, let me know.*

*As for how this has affected my views, well. Most of them are not good, except when they are. At my best, I would consider myself an optimistic nihilist. At my worst, I wouldn't know. My view on myself is that I am pointless, worthless, a failure, important to no one in any meaningful way, and completely incapable of doing anything I would enjoy in life, much less anything productive or helpful to others. Except for the times it isn't, where I can acknowledge and even enjoy my strong suits. People actively seek to befriend me and I have had strong relationships.*
*I am aware that I have value to myself and others, and even sometimes enjoy what few things I've done for myself. I've seen some interesting things, been to some interesting places. My opinions and views on literally everything shift from moment to moment, or mood to mood. Life and the world we live in is equaled in beauty only by it's brutality. Fair in its unfairness, harmonious in its discord. In life, one man may experience heaven and for it another man will experience hell. In the end, we are all the same life, being lived out through different circumstances.*

*How I feel largely dictates how I see everything in that particular moment. Sometimes it's balanced and calm, many times it is bitter and indignant. My place in this life it is mine to chose, but there is nothing I have considered that has moved me to the point of choosing to do it. Nothing about myself matters enough that I would ever do anything to better my situation or make my own life one that I would be proud to have lived. Even this may be an attempt to better myself, but it is not FOR myself. I'm doing it because I want to make someone else happier without losing them, to be better FOR THEM, not for me. I do not care about myself.*

*I have only rarely mentioned these things to people. My family knows, but, that's about it. I have told the current woman I am in a relationship with of some of my history, including the abuse, but certainly not most of it. Certainly not the experiences with drugs or some of the worse things I've seen, and done.*

*The relationship with my siblings is strained, at best. I have no idea where to even begin. I grew up with two brothers. One older by a year, one younger by a year. Our path from childhood to adulthood was spent making attempts to murder or inflict serious injury on each other, interspersed with brief moments of kinship. I can honestly say that I have very few, almost zero, good memories of either of them to this day, None of us had doors to our rooms because we kept destroying them, breaking them down each time one of us would start a fight and then run away.*

*There was an occasion I recall where an uncle of ours entered onto an altercation where I had a knife to the throat of my younger brother because he had antagonized me to the point of nearly killing him, meanwhile he laughed uncontrollably having been pleased with himself for doing so. He had once put rusty nails and screws into eggfoam outside my room and caused me to have over fifteen holes in my left foot when I stepped on it not thinking there would be anything in it. The older brother had a bunch of douchebag friends who themselves were basically bullies and awful to be around, and he himself was extremely violent. He was a Juggalo for a good portion of his teen years, if that explains anything.*

*I spent most of my life just trying to avoid the two of them. Hard to do without doors sometimes. I can list our literally hundreds of instances where we were all shitty human beings to each other and those around us. As of typing this, the two of them have had a fight where my younger was knocked unconscious, and beaten, sustaining a possible permanent injury to one of his ankles. I do not know if they'll ever speak again. And I've told both that I don't want to be a part of their shit.*

*When we were older, things got better. But all three of us have always been belligerant about whats been done in the past, and none of us really get along well for long periods of time. A few hours is usually my threshold before I need to be away from them. They can occasionally be good company, but, mostly not.*

*I think that's enough text for this one. I will say, I do not have faith in myself. I do not believe in myself. If I did, I would have done a lot more than I have. I wouldn't be failing every time I make an attempt to find some kind of happiness.*",1,"sexual abuse, trauma"
"I was with a group of friends last night, and another friend started talking to another friend about how many girls secretly liked him and stuff. It was crazy, because no one has ever talked to me about things like that. Then, on the way to the pub, a group of girls basically called me unattractive. Funny how girls are never shy about calling me ugly, but they're apparently too shy to ""approach me"". I never get signals, I've had shit luck on dating sites, no one ever approaches me, no one has ever had a crush on me, and my family are the only people that call me handsome. Nothing tells me that I'm ugly based on how girls treat me versus how they treat other guys.

"I never dreamt it could have lasted this long. It feels like every moment the feelings abate are really only a brief reprieve, the returning torment tears into my psyche with even less remourse. The corruption grows ever inside me, sometimes sleeping only to awake at times it needs to destroy.

The point of trauma feels so far away in time, nearly four years. When the episodes occur, it only feels as it happened just seconds prior. I have no physical ailments, only desolation of the mind. I haven't found an environment for healing, and I don't think I ever will. Isolation is sporadically maddening, not knowing if I'm truly losing my sanity or just feeling the pangs of past wrongdoings. Social circumstances are not helpful to the source of pain, when the episodes occur, all others can sense the turmoil and recoil at the possibility of backlash from this force.

It is a malevolent manifestation of my reality. All manner of action: speech, observation, hearing, all the surroundings are contorted to keep me bound to its dark will. None can even attempt to wrest control of the power it wields, its strength is insurmountable. I'm but a prisoner to its will, the slightest misstep in my path through life it sees an opportunity to grow and infest more within the spirit.

I feel as undeserving to face a plight so dire. It only exists when it feels the possibility to arise. I feel as though an instrument or vessel of its ill conceit. I look into a mirror to see a fair face staring back, crystal blue eyes, a symmetryÂ  throughout; many smiles from others abound me in my days, and I feel yet obligated to receive this blessing. My looks yet deceive my emotion, for I know a disgusted figure is writhing within. I cannot tell what yet be unattractive to most: a physical flaw or a scarring of the soul that only seeks to rend into another. I won't let my fellow man that deserve peace be upended in their stable life by a force so reckless.

So I reserve myself, keeping this force of trauma at bay from others, while enduring the suffering of its imprisonment. If love could break its chains that bind itself to me and I to it; it has not yet been gifted from those that radiate beauty throughout, or even a divine power to ease my pain. Society has disillusioned me of the agony I face. I am aware of flaws of the human nature that are best left ignored. Faced against this foe forces my consciousness to the dark reality.

I only wish I had an answer or remedy to this trouble, I fear that none may be found.",1,"Unattractive to most, physical flaw, agony, aware of flaws, best left ignored"
"I was a quiet weird child who couldn't talk to other kids. My friends were just bullies who abused my kindness and lack of courage. I spent my childhood online because everything was nicer and funner there. So of course i have no friends now and I dont know how to interact with people normally. Being truly alone is more painful and impactful than imaginable for most. I am now bitter and fed up with myself and everyone. I don't enjoy anything anymore, I cant do anything at all without feeling terrible. I cant think anymore my mind is blank I want to take a sledge hammer to my head just to see what's in there. Thatd be stupid though. I don't see a future for myself. I wish it didn't all happen like this, I feel like I never had a chance. abused in childhood never loved by anyone and jealous of everyone who isn't grateful that they're loved and appreciated. My mind is gone, any chances I had are gone at this point, socially I will never be successful and so what's the point? Youre depressed yeah just tell your friends and family they love you and want you happy! My family wont help me I dont have the means to help myself. My brain is fucking mush. What a world huh

"I made another post here before but I deleted it out of nervousness. This'll be my second one. Hope it's okay.

I have felt the worst pain ever due to hating my body. It is a great weight that just burdens me every day. I make it part of my life to protect other people from the repulsiveness. I don't wear anything that's supposed to compliment my body, because quite frankly, it just does the opposite. I could go into so much detail about everything. I hate my face and I hate my body. It is this horrible weight, this impending shame. The only thing I can describe it as is...shame. Horrible, horrible shame. 

I don't even hate my body, I hate what I did to it. I hate myself for abusing my body. It works so hard to keep me alive and I've destroyed it. I hate sitting down because then I feel the fat. I hate feeling my stomach touch my shirt because it reminds me that it protrudes even when I suck it in. I hate that my body's imbalanced, because of course, I was blessed with the small boobs that ABSOLUTELY NO ONE in my family has but me. I'm 50 pounds overweight and I have absolutely nothing. My doctor tells me it's okay (despite the BMI saying I'm obese). She tells me that I'm still in a safe range. My heart isn't in danger and nor is my body. That's a relief, but I still don't feel good.

I feel it's my duty to protect the world from my appearance. I don't want to subject anyone to what I have to see. I know people say that other people aren't looking and don't care, but that doesn't matter to me. I would never want myself looking like how I do in public. I don't wear anything that hugs my body. Some take it as ""modest"", and while I do aim to be modest, it's not because of that. I hate moving and getting out of bed and just talking because of it. I just want to hide from the world and stay in a box of shame and guilt. I hate feeling my stomach exist. I hate my stomach protruding. I hate how clothes cut my body fat in half. I call it the 3 phenomenon because it looks like the shape of 3 from a side view. That's the worst feeling to me. That's what always reminds me. I hate going outside and going into public because of it. I hate looking into the mirror. All I see is a ""sack of pig's flesh"", as I've named it. That phrase seems to be the only one that really captures the repulsiveness, disgust, and shame I feel.

I've dreamed of throwing up multiple times. But I know the dangers. I know it destroys your esophagus permanently. But I still want to fix it. I haven't done anything though. I may never do anything about it, regarding dangerous and reckless actions like throwing up. I know it won't ever be truly fixed, because as soon as I get skinny, then I won't have any good attributes. I don't know how I'll ever find a partner without anything appealing or pretty, because I've already cut the pool down to nearly nothing by waiting till marriage and being cyberschooled/being an absolute hermit. Not to mention also being a huge bitch.

I have tried so many times and I give up because I have no self control. I really think I need to be babysat on my diet. I need someone to keep an eye on me till I'm normal, and then get training to help keep a good lifestyle. I have no willpower. All I have is fear and sadness. Even that doesn't motivate me. I have no energy to be motivated. I've disappointed myself so much. I am a disappointment. I am a failure in so many regards and I am so mad at myself for everything. I live in shame. I have to constantly stare at this ugly sack of pig's flesh. It's caused me so much sadness. I don't want to do anything anymore because it just fills me with sadness adn shame. I don't want to stop existing. I just want to hide. Hide so others don't have to see it. No one has told me my body's beautiful. People just say ""you're not fat"" and I know damn right they're lying. They do that after I start whining and crying. Only then will they reassure me, and I know that's to shut me up. No one has ever actually told me I'm appealing. People have only told me my face is beautiful when I have makeup on. Once boys see me without makeup they stop talking to me (But that may also be cause I'm overbearing and kinda weird).

I don't even know if I should post this. I may actually delete this. Sorry if it's too long. Also, sorry if it sounds narcissistic or vain. I'm not looking for compliments. I just needed to say this.",1,"abusing my body, sack of pig's flesh, hating my body, repulsiveness, hate my face, horrible weight, impending shame, hate going outside"
"Hi all.

Not sure this is the right place for this; I submitted it on r/suicidewatch but there's so many threads on there I fear I won't get any replies.  I need some help and i'm scared to call a suicide hotline for fear of them staging an intervention or some such thing.

This is a first for me -- I've had moments in my life where i've felt close to the edge but things have been really hard recently.

I'll cut to the chase here.

Three years ago I suffered a workplace accident and broke my L3-l4 vertebrae, in addition to my hip. I sustained mid back complications as well that have caused heavy spasms and contusions. I've been fighting workers' comp for all three of these years to get treatment. I got my spine fused two years ago and my hip a little less than a year ago -- while things are better, to the extent that I can walk and such, I live in constant pain and discomfort. I still need to ice my lower and middle back constantly. I recently successfully applied and got invited to my dream job in the Peace Corps, but when I got to medical clearance they told me I couldn't handle the job. This has left me devastated. I thought I could beat this thing through sheer force of will, but my plans have crumbled to nothing and I don't know what to do.

Moreover, I was molested at a Christian summer camp when I was 11 years old and i have never been able to move past it. It has completely impaired my ability to form emotional attachments and even to perform sexually -- not necessarily all the time, but enough that i have blown every chance I've had at romantic normality or happiness. I fear it's messed me up beyond repair.

I am now 25 and tottering under the weight of these burdens. While in the past i've had an active and enjoyable social life and great/varied friends, a mixture of chronic pain and my own personality defects led to me having a very lonely ahd depressing New Year's -- a massive contrast from only a year ago, when I had a pretty damn good time.

The holiday isn't the cause, of course -- it's more just the catalyst to underlying issues I can't seem to beat.

I am lonely. I am in pain. I want desperately to live a normal life but I no longer believe it is possible.

Is there anyone out there who has beaten something like this? What the hell do I do? Where do I turn? How do I overcome this? Is it even worth it? I just want it all to stop.

I would appreciate any advice. I really would. I need 2018 to be different, and I fear it will not be.",1,"Molested, never been able to move past, impaired my ability, to form emotional attachments, even to perform sexually, workplace accident, couldn't handle the job, Lonely, in pain"
"Within the last month, she has lost her best friend and her grandmother, who she was very close with (both passed away). This time last year, she was involved in an incident where she was assaulted (we were not dating at the time), and it is bringing up some bad memories for her. She is continuously mentioning about moving cities on her own, and she keeps insisting she is fine. I'm the only support she has, please help !",1,"was assaulted, bad memories, lost her best friend, her grandmother, both passed away"
"When I was a kid, I was severely bullied. Be we realized why, but I suppose because I could not defend myself and did respond to them with stupid answers, they would target me. When I was in high school, I had 2 friends who were exclusively school friends. They did not care to hang out of school and once school was over, we never saw each other again.

Now years later. Same story. I am not being bullied but people like to talk crap which is inevitable. So I invested time and money in this class. I was traveling somewhere far for it, my classmates were all friendly to me and joking around. Added each other on social media. This class happened to be a short-term one since the teacher was quitting. I thought these people would get close to me and since we were getting along, that they would like to keep in touch. So NOTHING! Again same story as back in high school. I happened to like this guy who did not like me in return and did things to hurt me such as not inviting me to the farewell class party or not asking me to get involved with projects out of class. Then they like each other's pictures on social media but not mine. Then I see some of them coming to my city to visit but they do not care to meet me and hang out.

So why people bother and act so friendly in class but not out of? Is it that they just want to be on good terms and earn something? Why go and act that me and them are friends and we can hang out but when I ask they are all busy? I admit I seemed a little needy. I did not put effort back in school to make friends but this time I did. I was polite, I did ask them about their goals, tried to be around and active, liked their posts on social media. Only thing is that I had a fight with the guy I liked and everyone liked him in class, so most likely he spoke nonsense. 

I just feel very disappointed. Any advice?",1,"Bullied, did things to hurt, not inviting me to the farewell class party disappointed"
"It sucks because a flaw about your personality can easily be fixed and I doubt it has a strong impact. Being reminded constantly of body flaws is the worse in my opinion because that can just ruin someone completely. It just hits you in the heart because that's what everyone views you as. What sucks even more is that, you can be confident in your own skin and as soon as someone points out a flaw, that thought stays with you forever and will never escape your mind. All these insecurities build up and it's just horrible.",1,"body flaws,doubt, strong impact,everyone views you as, never escape your mind"
I'm 14 and I've been depressed since my dad died when I was 11 I've never had friends I'm unattractive never even hugged a girl I've been bullied since the 4th grade and to top it off my will probably send me to a military school I don't know what to do ,1,"Bullied, since the 4th grade dad died, unattractive"
"I'm not talking about our misconstrued constructs about what's morally acceptable. I'm talking about the hypocrisy and the pretentiousness, the megalomania that grips each and every person. I mean, everyone is so full of shit. We pretend to care about others, and want others to care about us, but it's not because we actually care. It's because we're the only thing that matters. As soon as it becomes convenient, we throw others to the side. So long as we can get our chemical fix, we'll slave away until the day we die, spouting bullshit and pretending as if things actually matter. Hell, we even have the ego to assume we have some kind of superiority over other living creatures. Are we not animals? Sorry, but just because we are subjectively more intelligent, doesn't mean our existence is any less futile or has any more meaning. Sorry to break it to you, but God's not real, and why would you even want him to be? (i may be inserting my preconceived notions as fact, but in theme with this post, Idgaf if you disagree) 
     On this subreddit, we all pretend to sympathize with each other, but I bet in real life we are all judgemental sacks of shit, and I'm willing to bet that because I know I certainly am. I like to spout about the woes of man, but in real life, I'm a slave to the emotional parts of my brain, an introvert with no social skills, humor, or personality. I don't explain this for pity btw, I explain this because I'm quite the hypocrite, and I'm willing to bet you are too. People who complain about gender inequality annoy me. People who complain about racial inequality annoy me. I'm a selfish prick, sure. But so are you. So stop forcing me to pretend to care about you? I have my own worthless ideals that I care about, and that you don't. For example, I think there is a ridiculous age inequality. For what reason should age be used as an indicator of expected respect? If you're a fucking idiot, and don't cater to my selfish wants, I'm not going to fucking respect you. I might be *age* and a know it all, but that doesn't guarantee I don't fucking know more than you. Even if I don't, everyone shouldn't just assume I don't and treat me like a fucking child, but then expect me to act like an adult. Are you fucking kidding me with the hypocrisy?
Oh, but even though you don't take my issue seriously, I should take racism seriously because it affects you personally and you would like to feed your ego.


I wasted enough time venting for no reason. Time to go waste my time working after staying up late for no reason. I don't really know what the point of this post was, but I feel like there was a general theme to it. I'm too tired to make a main point, all I know is that this post and every other post on here is effectively meaningless. ",1,"gender inequality, racial inequality, hypocrisy"

My depression has been at its peak for the past two months, and I've started to notice that in addition to my fucked up sleep schedule, I haven't been eating as much.
I just don't have an appetite. I'm just never hungry when I should be anymore.
And it sucks, as someone who is actually trying to gain weight (I've been underweight all my life, I'm 5'4"" and only ~101 lb), it really sucks. Some days I hate my body, and as much as I try to love it and do what's best for it-- my depression won't let me.",1,hate my body
"I don't really want to die, or rather I don't have any reason to and I want to not want to die, but I still know that probably in the next 5-10 years I'll just do it. I won't make some long post here, I won't call for help or show any major signs, I probably won't even give/have a good reason, I just know that one day I'm going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof or hang myself or something. The older I get the less in control of my own thoughts I feel, but I also feel like I have a better understanding of them. I can see how people can just go crazy and seemingly snap and start killing people or hijack a bus or start just running around naked or something, and if anything I'm lucky enough to know that I have no urge to harm others and would do anything to save someone that isn't myself, but I just feel the need to off myself and I know that eventually it'll just happen. Lately I've noticed myself getting into a lot more dangerous situations I think maybe because I feel a need to have control over my own death, and that getting in random fights with junkies on the subway and getting hit by cars when chasing the bus excites me because my life (or death) isn't in my control. I don't know maybe I'm the only one that feels this way but I wanted to see if anyone else had any similar experiences or tips with how to feel less trapped by my own depression.",1,"going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof "

"So i'm visiting another city with my friends, i knew upfront most of them would be couples and us single folks would be in minority, but what the hell, right? And at first, it went along well but now, two days in and i'm getting that feeling, like two people are making out violently next to you? Yeah, kinda like that. I also overhead someone say ""but anon is the only single person here, which i didn't really want spelled out to everyone. 

The only thing i'm thinking of right now is this and if maybe there's a bus that leaves for my city soon and jump on it without telling anyone. 

So i don't want to do now, other than eat and drink myself to sleep, with the others. I'm not bitching that ""waah, give gf now, waah"", it's just that I don't like being made fun of for this reason. So what, i'm single, i'm socially inept, and i'm depressed. That's me. ",1,jump on it without telling anyone
"So I donât know for sure that I am depressed, but it really does feel like it. I donât feel loved or cared about. Like Iâm not special, Iâm nobodyâs favorite person. 

But I know this isnât true. My family loves me very much. My mom, dad, sister, they all care for me so much, and I can tell. I donât necessarily have feelings that strong for them, but Iâve never felt very strongly about anyone. 

Does that make me wrong? To feel so unloved even though they do? Even if they are the only ones, why do I feel so bad? Whatâs wrong?",1,feel so unloved even though they do
"For the past few years I've been feeling more and more miserable and depressed and I don't know why.

Things that used to make me happy now just leave me feeling empty. I think my last truly happy day was my wedding day 1.5 years ago, which isn't great for a 28 year old guy I guess.

I think the speed at which things feel like they are getting worse seems to increase which each ""episode"", if you can call it that, where I normally have some kind of break down.

I feel like I'm trapped inside my own head, even though I know I should do something, or sometimes even want to do something I just can't. I'm telling myself to get up of the couch and do those things, but my body just doesn't seem to respond. Instead I just sit there and accomplish nothing.

I used to be so much more positive, I completely changed my career in retail to be a web developer and worked my way up to be in charge of my own team. I always fought my way through the pressure and got really far in my career at a young age and then at some point this all started.

Food is a side affect as well as a cause of a lot of my problems. As I'm so unable to get the motivation to do anything, I normally just order takeout rather than cooking food. Which in turn just makes me feel more guilty and the cycle continues.

It's strange, I image if you asked anybody that I work with or any of the few friends that I have they probably all think I'm a happy, outgoing person. The only person who knows is my wife and even then I'm not sure she knows the extent of how I feel. I also don't want to put extra pressure on her as she has dealt with depression before as well. She eventually went to her GP and they gave her some medication that has definitely made a difference to her outlook on life.

This was a while ago but it made me think that maybe I could get up the willpower to go to the doctors and see if they could help me. This morning I made an appointment with the doctor and I thought things might be looking up, but it didn't take long for things to come crashing down to an all time low.

When I got there they said they had been trying to call me all morning because they had to cancel my appointment since the doctor hadn't turned up. Annoying as it may be this should a reasonable excuse. Instead, I could feel myself stood at reception falling apart inside.

Every now and then I've had thoughts like ""Would things be better if I weren't here"" and afterwards I always said to myself that even though I'd thought it I'd never do something like that.

As I was walking home from the doctors, probably about 20 feet from my street where I had to cross over, it hit me. I was considering just walking straight into the road and I didn't even care. I was actually disappointed when I got to the edge of the path and there weren't any cars coming.

I got in the house and had a massive panic attack, I couldn't breath, then I was probably the most angry I've ever been and throwing things about and screaming at things. I didn't know if I was more annoying at myself for wanting to do it, or for not actually doing it.

I've calmed down a bit now and I've apparently got an emergency appointment with a different GP but all of this only happened about an hour ago and I just don't know how to feel or what to do anymore.

Thanks for listening,
Scott",1,trapped inside my own head
