"I have had problems with anxiety since my previous relationship, mainly related to relationship anxieties. 

I met my girlfriend in the summer holidays and we dated until we went to university. Whilst at uni we decided not to do long distance but ended up facetiming every evening for hours on end, and basically carried on dating. 

I was really excited to see her again over the Christmas holidays and then the anxiety kicked up again. I think the long distance had enabled me to not realise it was a relationship until I got home and it hit me and suddenly the fear of making the same mistakes I did in the past relationship hit me. 

I went to the doctors and was placed on anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medication and for the next week things were great again. But then the emotional numbness kicked in. I felt absolutely nothing for anyone or anything and it really got to me. Any feeling I did feel was just anxiety about the relationship. 

I want to get therapy about my relationship fears and I didn't feel like I couldn't do that whilst immersed in the fear, so I decided to break up with her so I could get help. I also stopped the anti-depressants because the numbness it made me feel caused me to self-harm which I've never done before. 

I'm so unbelievably sad. I love her, she's beautiful and kind and funny and I love spending time with her. I don't at all want to end it with her, yet I don't see how I could get help with the anxiety making everything feel like a mountain. 

I can't go back on it, I've hurt her too much by breaking up with her to say ""that pain was unnecessary because let's get back together"". And we agreed that if one of us broke up with the other then we wouldn't go back on it. 

I have this real hope that one day when I've addressed the fears I have that we can reconnect and try again but I know it's unfair on both of us to live with that expectation and hope. 

I have so many regrets and I hate mental illness more that anything. Im so sad that I can't be with her.",4,"long distance, relationship anxieties, emotional numbness, break up, self-harm, regrets"

"Iâve been a misanthrope all my life but it started with hope and now as everyday goes by, I lose every ounce of myself. I have been through a lot in my life so far, I lost my Dad who was my best friend only two months ago. He had a brain tumour operation which wasnât successful in 2015 and he was brain dead pretty much until Oct 2017 when he passed away from heart failure. He had been in hospital for a long time and since the end of 2015, Iâve lost who I am as a person. I not only have and went through panic disorder, anxiety (GAD) , severe depression and insomnia but also complete withdrawal. Anorexia was a hard one too, which i am still recovering from. I donât have friends (as a rule that I live by), because I donât trust human beings since Iâve been fucked over by so many of them in my life and the state of the world is a joke. I donât have anyone to turn to and every day, I think Iâm done. I am a postgrad student but Iâm lifeless as a person. Iâve lost passion for all the things I used to do, and the me I was is dead. She died the day my Dad fell ill, and the world I knew doesnât only no longer exist, but seems to never have existed in the first place. All the lies and the frustration makes me want to give up. This is pathetic and sad but, when I am not at university, I just eat and pretend like Iâm going to go out when I never do. Sometimes Iâll sit at a cafe and look like I have a lot going on, but the reality is I have nothing. Iâm lucky to be able to have academic prospects but Iâm only human and there needs to be a balance which in my life, there isnât. I donât care anymore and Iâve made an enemy of everyone I used to know. I look at people like disgusting aliens who I canât relate to and whenever Iâm out, I HAVE to be back at home. 

I havenât had a productive day in years, and it seems like Iâll never shake this feeling and my thoughts about the world. I really mean this : I HATE life, my life specifically. Nothing makes me happy like it used to. What amazes me are those people who can get a thrill out of a TV show, or a walk in the park or people with tons of plans and friends, or anyone who says âIâm busyâ. Iâm not jealous but then again, yes I am.

Maybe I should tell people about how I feel. Maybe I do need help. Iâve spent my life holding everything in. From tears to rages of anger. But now...I feel like Iâve hit a breaking point. Iâve felt like Iâve had hit points like this before but theyâre nothing compared to this. Iâm just really confused and I can think straight. I feel alone and scared of the world, scared of myself. I hate myself to the point where getting off the bus for school gives me so much anxiety I could start crying. I always feel judged, my friends are starting to fade. Maybe thatâs why I need to strengthen the ties with them, so I donât lose them. I just hope the year ahead can be better than the previous.

"Perhaps I'm feeling maudlin because it's New Year's Eve, and this is the time we're supposed to look back over the previous year and try to make positive changes and take action to ensure the coming year is a better one. But I've been stuck in the same situation for so many years that I just can't bring myself to hope anymore for change, and right now I just feel worse than ever. I'll try to explain concisely, if I can. Apologies for the really long post, but I've held this in for a long time and I needed to get this off my chest.

I've known since forever that my parents haven't had the happiest of marriages. The biggest (and according to them, only) problem they have is my grandmother, my mom's mother-in-law. Now, I am given to understand that most in-laws don't have great relationships. With my mom and her MIL, things have been... horrible from the start. Her MIL (I don't like calling her my grandma, because she disowned me at birth and ignores and belittles me every chance she gets) has constantly tried to undermine her, badmouths her publicly (and in our society - Indian - reputation is everything), manipulates my dad by behaving like a sick, helpless woman in front of him (although she's the healthiest woman you could ever meet, otherwise) and claiming she's been on her deathbed for the last 25 years, makes caustic comments about my brother and I, and tries to provoke fights between my parents as often as she can in the hopes of breaking them up. These are incidents that I have seen occur myself, not things that my parents ever told me. They've avoided talking about this directly with me, perhaps fearing that they were forcing me to believe one of them over the other/influencing my beliefs in some fashion. But I could see these things happening, even if I wasn't old enough to quite understand them for a while.

My parents filed for divorce when I was a year old, but somehow they managed to reconcile, with the outcome being that my mom was forced to give up her job and her dreams of studying further to look after me because of course her MIL refused to.

Until my brother came along 8 years later, I remember things were pretty bad in the house; my dad wanted us to live together out of fear for his mother's health and not knowing what accusations or stories to believe, my mom hated the way she was being made to feel in the house and the way her actions were being lied about. Little incidents began being blown way out of proportion on both sides, there were some pretty huge fights. I lived with my mom's parents for a while (I love them, and have a deep bond with them). I wasn't a go-between for my parents, not then, but I knew I was still in the middle of their arguments. They wondered if the divorce would still have fallen through if I had not existed. But I knew they both loved me more than anything, and that was all that mattered.

And then my brother came along - a somewhat late miracle. He's nine years younger than I am, and with him came a move to another city where the four of us could finally live together by ourselves, and things seemed to be better - at least on the surface. Another move, and things seemed to be looking up, because my parents only really ever fought about was this woman. I finished school, started college, was somewhat reasonably happy that my parents weren't fighting as much anymore. My priority became to make sure my brother knew a loving home, where our parents didn't just love us with all their heart but also loved each other.

Then this year, my dad had to move back to the original city we're from, and I didn't want that to happen. But it did. And now we're back to square one, seemingly, except square one looks a lot scarier now that I'm no longer blind to every little thing that angers them. My mother's going through menopause at the moment, but she's more of a physical slave to her MIL's more and more obscure household demands than ever. She's depressed because she doesn't see how much longer this can continue, this life that she isn't living for herself. My father's unable to understand why we can't all just get along and be one big happy family, but then again he's at work all day, and when he's home his mother behaves differently. For her part, my mom's MIL doesn't want to live with us; she thinks she has enough money to live alone, even though she claims she's too sick to even move on most days. My brother, thankfully, doesn't care about this ridiculous and unnecessary soap opera drama. That leaves me.

My parents now confide in me when I beg them for an explanation as to why they look so distressed and harried all the time. They've never badmouthed each other to me, but I can see more clearly now how unhappy this marriage has actually been, and how afraid they both are that the next 20 years will be the same muddled mess the last 20 have been. 

I wish I hadn't asked for explanations, and I feel guilty that I wish I were even more removed from it all than I already am. I'm on campus in another city for half the year, but whenever I come home it's to a negative, toxic, depressed atmosphere that makes sure my determination to be positive goes down the drain. I feel angry and ready to snap, too, even though I have no reason to be. I feel guilty for leaving my parents in this situation for half the year, and for enjoying myself even a bit when I'm out because I know how sad they often are back home. I just want this to be over. I want a solution to this problem. I find myself wishing my grandma would hurry up and die, and there's a dark thought I didn't think I'd be voicing out loud but here we are. If people I love, like my other grandma and my aunt, can die before their time surely people I dislike can also disappear. I know it's wrong to feel this way, and I tell myself to buck up and be normal whenever I'm depressed enough about the situation to think this.

It's not so bad as I'm making it out to be. There have been plenty of good moments - in their marriage, and certainly us kids have never once doubted how united they are in doing their best for us. But I want it to be like that *all the time*. I want that happy family life. I don't want this sadness, and I certainly don't want to be the one aware of the massive failure in communication that occurs very often. And then I think I'm wrong for feeling that way. Basically, I'm a huge mess.

**TL;DR** My mom's MIL is a horrible person, nothing will ever change, my parents are stuck in a vicious cycle that is making them - and me - miserable, and I don't know how I can get myself out of this funk.",4,"Divorce, get this off my chest, distressed, unhappy this marriage has been, negative, toxic, depressed atmosphere, huge mess"

I decided to spend my night alone in my room because I need a rest from spending my nights with meaningless distractions. Basically just gonna have a nice sleep at 10pm after writing a resolution letter for my future self.

"My life feels like a sham. I am 23 years old working basically a dead end job that I have no desire to work in. My original plans were to use my undergraduate to get into professional school but I can't get into any of them so I am on the verge of giving up on those. I probably don't have any aspirations to be in the field I am in but with my parents pressuring me to go into this field, I felt as though I had no other option. I have no real hobbies other than playing mobile games, watching TV/Netflix/YouTube and eating.

I have a few friends but the relationships now feel surface level. I don't know if I could muster up the courage to tell them the extent of my depression. We have discussed bits and pieces of it, but never fully in depth. While the other friendships I have are mainly just hanging out playing video games, talking about music and getting high off weed, that's about it. I find no real joy in things anymore. The activities and things I do try, only remind me of how much of a fuck up I am because of my lack of life experience.

Growing up and currently I am an introvert. My family almost encouraged it becaus I feel as though they didn't know what else to do. I'm not sure how it all started if I'm being honest. It would be so bad that gatherings and social issues events where I didn't know people, I would pretend I was having nausea and hide in the washroom the whole time. Man, as I'm typing this, I'm just really ashamed at what I've become. Over the past few years I've tried to rectify these behaviors and I have seen improvements here and there (I don't hide in the bathroom anymore). However what I'm going to talk about next is probably one of the major reasons why I'm sad.

So in the 23 years of my life, I've never had a real relationship before. There have been moments I go to the club or try online dating where I flirt, but that's the extent of my romantic life. Introversion feeding into my depression has basically paralyzed my mind. Everytime I want to flirt, I switch into a different mode and act shy. At the same time, I try to avoid romance for reasons I've said previous. I'm very depressed with my life and what it's come down to. I don't like the job or the field that I've been planning to do all my life. I have no real hobbies or passions outside of sitting on my ass at home, nor have I developed any real skills. They say confidence is key when approaching women, but my self-esteem is shot to rock bottom and I can never find enough courage to bring myself to ask a girl on a date. On top of that, what happens when I do ask and she says yes, where do we go from there? 

I have family that is Christian but over the past few years I probably align myself as b in agnostic. Because of this, I don't really mesh well with my family and their friends since I'm thinking of completely different perspective. I still live my family and I love them so much, but I realize that this is not helping my situation. All I know is that it's going to take me a long time to save up and move out somewhere.

Speaking of moving out, I make terrible financial decisions. I spend money frivolously on entertainment and food. I also masturbate way too frequently which i know interferes with things such as my social and love life. I'm about 30 lbs over the ideal weight for my age and height but have no resolve or willpower to work out. I've had braces a few times and never ended up keeping the retainers so I still have crooked teeth. I feel like a fuck up every time I look into the mirror because of that. That is something I know I have to life with until I get the money to fix them myself.

That's the other thing about myself. If you haven't noticed by now, a lot of things I want to start or quit, I've never been able to. My will power and resolve is also rock bottom. I've tried working out, stopping masturbating, keeping straight teeth, you name it, I've never committed to anything. I don't know what is wrong with me, I can't keep myself going for more than a week befor relapsing before going back to old ways.

My family has started to notice how mad and sad ive become but have no real suggestions. My parents continually push me towards the field that I have no desire to pursue. I know they mean well, they want me to able to live well within my means. I also know things would be much different growing up in their shoes moving from India to make a better life for themselves and our family. But with that being said, my family doesn't understand how important mental health is for someone. My father treats my mother like absolute crap nowadays, but my mother is too worried about Indian cultures and traditions to do anything about it. My father has always cared about us but my mother has been a different story and I see it killing my mother inside. Again wee are Christian Indians and while it's not unheard of, it is certainly looked down upon. The sad thing is my mother would rather be in this marriage then to live out her days alone. That type of mentality devastates me and I could never possibly resonate with me. Hey it's easy for me to say never being in a relationship but I hope this behaviour isn't condoned regardless. So how could I possibly tell them the extent of my depression?

My life has been set up for me to live a nice and comfortable existence. However, ive managed to fuck that up every possible way down this long road. Ive never thought about seriously ending it all, but the thought has come up on multiple occasions. I know my family would be heartbroken if they were to find out something like that happened, so I guess there's one reason to live. Haven't considered therapy or drugs until now but I'm probably going to go once the new year begins. All I'm seeking now is a road to happiness somehow.",4,"father treats my mother like absolute crap, dead end job, life feels like a sham, terrible financial decisions, spend money frivolously on entertainment and food, no resolve, willpower, masturbate way too frequently"

"Hey guys,

So yes to spend 2018 off i am crying alone in my bedroom thinking where did it all go wrong and nearly attempting suicide.

Ive been building up my depression for over 15 years... pretty much starting when my parents broke up. I always use to have anxiety feeling that would make my gut whirl following with bad events taken place in 15mins... this resulting in a massive ammount avoiding bad incidents and essentially hiding from them. 

Coming to the present i feel like i am slowly getting to the point where friends are harder to come by and my current friends are slowly moving on with their own lives and leaving me behind (i feel like this due to not being invited anywhere or left to the last minute it makes me feel like a total loser when i have to ask someone what theyre doing) i also dont have the courage to find a soulmate purely due to knowing where to look or how to approach someone.

Anyways i want to know of anyone else success stories on tackling depression for the first time as i strongly beleive ive been stuck in this cloud for months. Hoping to seek advice from a professional.

My main wave of depression kicks in when i feel like my soul has a purpose it is pretty clear due to when stimulating my brain with something exciting that makes me feel like a have a purpose (this could be a simple as talking to someone) and the moments after said event finishing and the sense of importance to my existing fading.

Im sorry if this doesnt make sense but i got to the point where i nearly killed my self driving home though i told myself i think its time that i depended on someone for a chance and that i dont need to hold onto all the pain.

This world is tough no matter who we are... there is a few user online this NYE anyone reading please dont give up even though it may appear close friends and family dont care about you/me but sadly this is the true power of depression and in most cases causing the mind to be clouded. 

Life currently has taught me to respect everyone how you would like to be respected.",4,"parents broke up, attempting suicide, mind to be clouded"

Now with me, I had a pretty sociable personality and without blowing my trumpet can say that I was pretty and had excellent grades and because of this my dad was very lenient to me and gave me freedom.

Now my brother when he was 16 and I was 13 came to me with a weird request. He said he was already name called and did not want people taunting him that his little sister was ahead of him even at dating and hence wanted me to put off dating till we passed high school.

He said at that time that he knew his request was unreasonable but told me that since I was going to be pretty and would have guys asking me out and once I turned 18 or 19, he would help me out in my selection ( with my choice being a priority ) and would also in the meantime come out of his shell.

I flatly refused and said that I wanted to date a boy ( whom he had never even seen ) and experience HS life

That's it.

He stopped talking to me from that day and I never made that much of an effort.

After my first break up, I was asked out by the most popular by of HS who I later realized was the ringleader of the group of the gang that targeted my brother.

I promptly broke up with him and apologized to my brother who said that it further reinforced of his feelings of detest he had of me.

His says that ever since I started going out, his bullying increased even further and he felt that I had put my social life ar more than his comfort

He moved out when he turned 18 and could not make anything of his life,

He has since then been depressed, angry and had had trouble getting up in the morning and stay outside of the house for more than hour or two,

My dad cannot bear the humiliation that his own son is a bum started taunting him as a shameless loser and this made him get a part time job

He lives alone in a damp dingy apartment and my father and me pay him money per month and he also earns from part time job.

Now I THOUGHT once school life is over, He would help me out, talk to me and have the same relationship as before

BOY was I wrong.

He wants nothing to do with both me and my father, He says that bar financial help, he does not even want to look at me and feels that both me and my dad have screwed his life up.

He says that to me he admits he is being a bit unfair, but says that he always wished I had heeded to his request and maybe postponed of my dating life.

I thought after 4 years of non-contact time would have healed his wounds but boy he still cannot get over it. I could easily cut of his financial supply and have thought of this option so the he atleast can come live with me but did not go through with this.

HE SAYS he will never talk to me and forgive me and my dad even when we turn 50 and would not even COME TO MY DAD'S BURIAL if and when he passes away.

Says he regrets having a younger sis and wished for atleast an elder sis or a younger brother.

I do not know what to do as I was okay with cutting of for 4 years but cannot stay away for another year or 2. Do I cut him off financially and let him suffer ( atleast he would understand How I help him)

Also My dad too does not care and considers him a major failure",4,"SAYS he will never talk to me, forgive me and my dad even when we turn 50, not even COME TO MY DAD'S BURIAL, wished for at least an elder sis or a younger brother, dad too does not care,considers him a major failure"
"I don't want to die, I just don't feel almost anything, I don't know how to live.


I'm 25, never had a girlfriend, never had a real job, don't work at all since July and barely leave home.


I meet with only 3 people, but I'm really unsure if they consider me a friend. I feel like a placeholder, second choice, we don't really do anything, usually only eat and or watch TV. Except maybe for 1 who invited me to home new year's eve party but I got too anxious about meeting new people, so I cancelled.


In general I avoid meeting new people, I don't know what to talk about, I never can come up with a new topic, and especially I don't have anything interesting to say about myself. Those people that I meet with, they don't converse. They either don't talk at all, or talk and talk. Those are the only ""conversations"" that don't make me nervous, when I feel that I'm not obliged to say anything, but if I got anything to say I can say it.


I joined a gym but I don't enjoy working out, and even more I don't feel comfortable around so many people. Sometimes I'm freaking out because I'm not sure if should I shake hand with someone, or say something. When I'm resting between sets I almost try to hide and not draw anyone.


I feel intimidated by eye contact, especially with girls. Now this may sound super-stupid but recently a cute girl at the gym said ""Hi, how are you"" to me, and I replied with ""hello"" and walked away a little. In like two seconds she's in front of me, smiling, looking to my eyes and goes again with ""How are you"". Of course, I got completely frozen for long enough to make her walk away, probably thinking that I'm some weird deaf retard. The most pathetic part about it is that was the closest thing to a date I had in 2017.


I think it's a safe bet that my biggest issue is social anxiety. General anxiety would be second, and third for, I think, mild depression, mostly loss of joy?


Other than that I don't like how I look, partially maybe because of low self esteem and - very, highly, probably - inferiority complex.


I took antidepressants and anxiolytics (and hypnotics) for very long, now I don't take any ADs at all, anxiolytics in low doses and only if I really feel the need.

"I'm not really expecting sympathy as I know what I did was wrong.  Note, this is going to be long lol.

So basically I've been seeing this guy online for three months now and we instantly hit it off.  We were texting each other constantly everyday but little did he know that I was actually a catfish who posed as a pretty cute person who was just camera shy.  This was my first time catfishing and instantly after a day of doing it I deleted my account from the dating site but kept in contact with him without telling him who I was.  

Now, this ""relationship"" lasted through November and December which were both of our exam months which gave me the perfect excuse to why I couldn't meet him since we both live in the same area.  He was the perfect guy to me, we shared stories, our feelings, and talked about what we did on that day.  He was everything that I wanted to be; he was sporty, popular, and talented.  What made me fall for him though was that he was so supportive during my exams were he would actually take his time for a couple hours and tutor me.

Over time I just stopped sending him photos and he didn't care he thought I was just shy, but in reality my guilt was just building up.  I wanted to tell him badly but before I did I sought help on subreddits such as r/amiugly and others to get a sense of how I looked.  Obviously, this was a major mistake on my part and resulted in a major blow in my confidence levels.  I was a wreak, and still am.

I told him I was a catfish 3 days ago and to my surprise he took it really well and forgave me really well, he actually complimented me on how I was such a good catfish.  To my surprise he confessed that he also catfishes other people, but instead he catfishes people for fun.  This was going great.  **Until** he confessed that he had a boyfriend all a long and he was pretty promiscuous; but this thought never would have crossed my mind.  I showed him my real photos and he rated me a a 5.5/10.  I was completely average to him, I was ""not too bad"".  He wanted to remain friends and so I did. 

The consequences?  Honestly, I think I've been let off easier than most people but a part of me wishes he just totally broke ties with me.  This was my first relationship that felt meaningful with a person.  Looking at his pictures kills me inside and I haven't talked to him for 2 days now.  I feel empty and alone.  The nightly ritual that we once had of talking from 11 pm to 4 am was gone.  I don't know what to do; this catfishing scheme only resulted in many many insecurities.  I think I've fallen into depression; I feel lonely, jealous of his life, ugly, inadequate.  On top of this is other things like my joblessness.  I find myself comparing my life with his, he was everything I wanted to be.  I'm not sure if I should even still talk to him.  I find myself thinking about him every minute of my day.  I know I can never compete with his boyfriend, he is un reachable now.

This will be my first and last time catfishing.  I'm not sure if this is the effects of losing a friend, having my first ""breakup"", being called extremely average, or both.  Thanks for reading my rant if you're still here lol.  If you're the one I catfished, sorry again... I really wish to talk like we used to.  This is a horrible way to celebrate the new year... a part of me wishes that I had confessed after my Christmas break to remain happy just a little longer...

Ps.  For those who are confused, I'm a guy too.

**TL;DR** I catfished another guy, fell in love after he supported me for so long.  I confessed; found out he had a boyfriend all a long and that he thinks I'm average af.  I'm depressed now after my first breakup because I miss him and never can get him.",4,"totally broke ties with me, wanted to remain friends,had a boyfriend all a long, feel empty, alone, sense of how I looked ,was a wreak joblessness thinking about him every minute of my day, catfishing"

"Like most everyone in this subreddit I suffer from depression I've been dealing with since I was a child now well into my 30's. In spite of it have able been able to get things done like graduating from college even after loosing someone I loved. It was one of the hardest things that I've ever done. However, these past few years have been really pushing my limits. I won't go into details but things are bad and I need to be learning new skills on the side as my job may not be as secure (thought I don't even like it). That way at least if I do lose my job I can be working in a different field.

I can't seem to be able to muster enough focus/energy to even get started. There were only 2-3 things that helped me to deal with my depression (non drug related) but now I can't seem to get any enjoyment out of them anymore. I have always felt that since I've dealt with depression for such a long time I would always find a way to function. This no longer the case and I'm at a crucial time where that weight I feel on my back can't be interfering with what I have to do. So to those of you out there on the same crappy boat how do you maintain enough function to get thru the things you have to do? 

A little background on me: I have zero friends as the one or two I did have turned out weren't the people I thought they were. I take care of an elderly parent.

"2017 

Started it jobless. Struggling with everything. I was becoming afraid to even leave my house. Fear and anxiety basically consumed me. 
Medications were basically ruining my life, even after switching, switching, switching. Every one I tried, gave me severe, unusual side effects. (let's stay off this topic, just this was my personal experience and rather not get into it)

Toxic home life, even though I got myself out of situations quick as could.. the new home would end up being toxic as well.
I went into debt trying to not be homeless. 
I disappeared a lot socially. Sleep a lot. Eat too little. Eat too much. That same old stuff.

But I kept going to therapy. Even if it took me several months to go back. Sorry I avoided you Sharon for almost a year, you are a wonderful therapist.
She told me not long ago, that she thought I didn't need therapy anymore.
I used to hate it. But I would go. I would end sessions by sitting in my car crying and trembling from letting myself be vulnerable. 

Slowly, it got better. Slowly, I got better. I'm still terrible at talking her advice, but we worked on a lot. I didn't want to end therapy, I said I still have lot more to work on. But looking back, I think she is right. I don't need it anymore, least for now. (though I do intend of doing check-up sessions here and there or when Im struggling lot more again)

I got a job at a nearby store that I loved and would frequent when I could. 
It changed my life working there. It's not anything special perhaps to most people, but I met the most wonderful coworkers and management that really, truly do care about you and try their best to work with you and your needs. 
I ended up being able to work a second job for seasonal, though they say they will probably keep me, and I didn't know how I was going to make it through the week working so much.
But I am glad I did. I'm able to live alone in a small rental mother-in-law home. I started to live here with a friend I had since 4th grade.
I know her true colors now, and after much fighting, she finally left and got all her stuff few days ago. Needless to say, I hope I never see her again. 

I'm on my own here now.

I got groceries for the first time in a long time on my own without any help.

I have a new bed to sleep in, no longer my old bed from childhood.

My bills for the month are paid for.

I'm doing well on paying my debt off, I'm keeping up. 

I have a great support group now. 

I actually have people I can truly call ""best friend"".

I have a cheerful, wonderful baby nephew that makes any day better.

I don't disappear months at a time now.


I want to cry from how relieved I am.

I think I can finally live not in fear anymore.

For the first time in my entire life at home, I woke up not wanting to hate myself

I woke up wanting to enjoy my day and it doesn't feel like I'm trying to just ""survive""

"I've been on and off depression for my entire life, sometimes it can be triggered by a traumatic event, but in most cases it just happens.

I have friends, I have a good job, I have a roof over my head, and I have hobbies that make me happy.

However, I still go through episodes of just feeling completely alone, sad, and suicidal. I'm at the point where I've just accepted it and try to roll with it until it goes away for a few days and I can feel somewhat normal.

But unfortunately, none of my family or friends can really understand it. They get angry at me for being depressed or spending days locked in my room. I tell them that I can't control it, but they always say I'm just acting out. Like no, fuck off Debra why would anyone want to act like they're depressed?

"No native speaker, so sorry, if I made some mistakes.
So, I'm 16 right now. For few years my mental health was getting worse and worse. Always most people of my age were rejecting me when I tried to make friends with them, what made me really hateful person. Inside however I was disgusted by myself as I knew that only reason they are rejecting is fact that I'm somehow inferior to them.
It's not like everybody hated me, there were few people who proved to me, that they are my real friends, but I was spending most of my time alone. I was thinking a lot. World lost most of its colors to me. Everything was so senseless. I tried to do something with myself, for example I spend a lot of time working out, but nothing was working. I started cutting myself and I was thinking about killing myself more and more.
My whole life I think I've gathered around me 9 people who I was calling my ""friends"". Between them was this one girl, let's call her W. So about one year ago I've discovered that W is more important to me than other people. I tried spending more time with her and we grew close to each other.
One month ago I decided that if in three days nothing changes in my life I will kill myself. I knew no-one would cry about it, my parents for example never hid the fact, that they hate me.
In this time I had one really important conversation with W. Basically ther was one guy, let's call him J. She wanted him to be her boyfriend, but when he found out he started bullying her. He threw many insults at her, what really hurt. I should mention that she's from the broken family. She told me, that she doesn't have any will to live and she was planning to kill herself in the near future. I've said that day to her many things I've felt. I told her that she is most beautiful and inteligent I've ever met and J should be beaten to pulp for what he did. I think she felt better. Next day we were hanging out again and I asked her to be my girlfriend. She agreed.
We are together for a month now. Existence still was painful to me, but she was my reason to live. I knew without her I will commit suicide. I love her.
Few days ago I asked her if she wants to spend New Year's Eve together. She said that she will be partying with some girls, so she didn't want me around.
AND RIGHT FUCKING NOW I'M LOOKING AT PICTURES OF HER PARTYING WITH J. WHAT THE FUCK. WHY IS THIS HAPPENIG TO ME",4,"she didn't want me around,mental health was getting worse and worse,parents, they hate me spending most of my time alone, what made me really hateful person"
"I have extremely high standards when it comes to soulmates and partners, in fact, I've such high standards, me being 20 years old 
 I never had a girlfriend, and yes, I am extremely good with people; I can tell almost immediately who's who just by looking at them and conversing for a few minutes, and no, I'm not socially awkward, nor do I have social anxiety. A few days ago I saw perhaps the most perfect, and the absolute ideal soulmate in a video on youtube I've ever seen in my lifetime, and no she isn't super-famous or super-rich or anything, she's a starter youtuber. If you know a thing called ""internal checklist"" that you have for the perfect partner to fit under, appearances, personal traits, perhaps manners, the way they dress, their ""own world"" etc, not only was mine fully filled, it also has extras, AND she's single. Sadly, this isn't a story with a happy ending. She has a social anxiety, I've no way to get in touch with her, nor would I want to make her uncomfortable by being a random creep who follows her around, does research on emails /contact info etc, I'm not thinking about myself in this case because she purposefully hid her email address from youtube as well as contact info and I won't try to obtain it. I did try to look her up on facebook, and she hid everything from public, hence proving that it'll just make her even more uncomfortable if some random unknown freak sends her a random email to an address that shouldn't've been discoverable by public. This glass effect is SO bloody painful; I can see her, I hear her talk, yet she will never know about my existence, we will never meet, and never look at one another in real life, ever. It is new year's eve today, and I literally just feel like going back into my maths [I'm studying compsci] and not getting out of the world of mathematics for the next 3 months, I feel HORRIBLE, just so damn empty, tired, somewhat broken, especially when I realize that such people (for me I mean) probably will come up once every 20 years, judging by my past years. Obviously not suicidal, but my fucking god, I've never felt such a strong soul pain. I know it might sound cringy, and I'm sorry about that, I've just never felt this pain before. And if this is love at first sight, why in oblivion is it glorified so much? This pain is just so damn unbearable, especially knowing that I may, perhaps either end up being alone because such people are **ridiculously** rare, or marry someone just for financial stability, which most likely won't be the case for me; money means nothing if there are no feelings.

I'm posting this in the hope dat Its something to talk about with someone. Maybe someone can pull me back to the ground. 

I've written thus pretty quickly so sorry for the typos in advance. 

Writing this story is actual the first one so I don't know what other perspectives there will be. But the first one will be the most realistic one. The one that's in my head and the one I'm currently living. No lies, no bullshit, no beautifying things. It's not a nice story, it's not a beautiful story. I hope it's written in a way you can follow, and I hope you enjoy it, I hope you can understand. And maybe this will never be seen by anyone other's eyes. 

The reason I'm writing this I because I want to get it out of me. For the first time I feel that I can actually change my thoughts. Maybe just maybe I can trust again. Maybe my thoughts of worthlessness and being the worst person can fade away. Maybe I need help. Maybe my dark and scaring thoughts can go away. Maybe someone will read this and can understand or maybe relate to this. Just maybe ... 
 

So let me take you back. Think of this boy 16 years old just moved, for the 3 time in 5 years. His mom was kind of his Idol. She was always there and she was able to keep me safe and protect me a little bit from my strict dad. 
Friends a had a few. I switched schools a few times so I didn't make a lot. Some were colleagues some work classmates. O and I mustn't forget, I had a girlfriend. She's my first girlfriend and she was a
2 year older then me. I don't think I really liked her that much, but for the first time someone liked me instead of falling for a girl that's way out of my league. So I stuck with her for a while. 

So almost immediately after we moved my parents started fighting. They did this before but not as much as they did now. The fights were different. They didn't had a subject, they were just fighting for the heck of it. My sisters, of which I have 2, didn't live with us anymore. They moved out and the youngest one only went back once every few weekends. They didn't notice it as much, but even they could tell something was wrong. 

After a few months my mom decided it was time to go to her parents, she would talk with them about my parents relation. On that moment I got back from work and my sister was back home as well. When we sat down, my dad's phone when off. He got a text from my mom, but it wasn't addressed to my dad. It said something as follows:

Hi dear, just talked to my parents, Hmm. Doesn't look that bright anymore. Probably won't take long any more, hmm. Miss you, love. 

This is all I remember off it and it's translated so it won't be 100% but you'll get the gist of it. And you'll also probably guess this wasn't supposed to go to my dad. It's was meant for someone else. My dad, sister and I all read the message, and could believe our eyes. What does this mean, what will happen now? 

At this point is was scared, no frightened. Frightened of the thought my parents would divorce. Frightened of the thought that I'm probably going to have to choose a side. Choose between the person you trusted with whole your life, but now seems can't be trusted and the person that was always strict. 
When my mom got back from her parents, she asked for my dad to come outside with her cause something went wrong and she had to explain her self. She told a very nice story. It's just how she and her colleagues texted with each other. For a second I wanted to believe that. I wanted it to be true,. But I knew it's probably not. This will be marked as the start of the divorce it thought to myself. 
My sister and I talked to her, she promised the didn't lie, that's she  old be trusted and she would never do such a thing. Yet again, I wanted to believe it so for then, I just accepted it, went upstairs and tried to sleep. 
Like I said this night would be marked as the start of the divorce, but it's also first thing I can recall what is damaging me I guess. After this night I can't remember a lot. It feels like my recordings have stopt for a few days / weeks. 
The next event I know, but I'm not totally sure where it fits in the time line, is coming downstairs on Sunday too see my sitting at the diner table, crying. Crying his heart out. Being broken by the months and months of arguing with my mom about nothing. He was devastated and didn't know what to do anymore. At that moment I didn't know what to do. I wanted to comfort him, but I didnt feel present at that moment. My sister was already up and she was talking to him. Trying to calm him down. 
Like I said I didn't k ow what to do. I wanted to hug him, but he always had seem to be arms length away from me. The thing I regret the most now about this, is that I was too scared of my own emotions to stay or to comfort my dad. I took my stuff and went to work. At work time stood still. It was comforting cause I  could clear my mind but also upsetting cause I wanted to go to my family. I wanted to know what was going on. I talked to my girlfriend who was working at the same place at the time. She didn't really help. She didn't have that much empathy and couldn't really listen to my story. When my shift ended I went home and that's the last I remember about it. 
At times I think the evening marked as the start was adjacent to the Sunday morning, but that just doesn't seems right. 

The last event before the divorce that I know is the most haze one. I only k ow a few things. I was up in my room, I wasn't alone. But I don't know if a friend was there or my girlfriend. My dad was at home. So it's probably a Saturday or Sunday. 
Suddenly my mom opens the door and tells me she packed a few things and is going away. I remember her asking me something. I don't know what. I belive it was either: do have anything to say go my? Or : would you care to join me? 
Either way I stayed in my room and that's the last I know of it. 
It turned out my dad had heard her over the phone, talking to a friend of hers, saying ""I know it's wrong, but when ever I hear his voice, it's like falling in love again"". This is when my dad said she should pack a back and go. 

Soon after this broke up with my girlfriend, the fact that I didn't really like her that much and I didn't fell that well and she could help me pushed me over the ledge to do it. 

So when my mom got out of the house she stayed a few weeks in her colleagues home. He didn't life there cause he just moved in with his girlfriend I believe, but I'm not sure. Our dad forced us a couple of times to get over there. Talk to to her, he always said ""don't forget, she's still your mother"". 
I found it extremely difficult, just talking to her, she broke my trust, She made my dad cry.  I didn't k know what for say but the fact that I was disappointed or even discussed by her mad when feel bad. And I wanted her to feel bad. I wanted her to feel the worst of us all. She'd deserved that. I deserved that, but she didn't. Or maybe she did but she never showed after that one night. 

Within a year she told us she had met someone else. When we asked of he was this person she meant to text during the first event. She promised us this is someone else. An old friend. It was my dad's best friend, at least I believe he was. They even had a certificate about it, and they both had it hanging in the hall way. 

After she promised, after we started to believe we found out he was that person all along. It also turned out that my mom talked and went to him even before the whole arguing started. Phone records showed everything she did and for how long it went on. Even showing this she held on to her lie. This is the hardest part of trusting someone, trust in someone is as strong as they are believable. my mom, not so much. 
After a while I found a girl, who was amazing. I thought she was beautiful. From the moment I first layed eyes on her I though, damn this is something else. 
And she was. It took me some time to persuade her. She first wanted to stay friends and such. The  she fooled around with someone else. That was the first time she hurt me actually. She lied about that. Maybe that was some kind of sign, maybe not. After that I tried again  and succeeded. She was officially my girlfriend and I've never felt better at that point. 
We did a lot together but not everything. So we had space to our self. She was needy though, but not too much. After being together for almost a year I decided to move. I wanted to stay in dorms close to my school, and so I died. At first the didn't like that. She wanted to keep me close. But I couldn't stand the traveling for 3-4 hours a day. Eventually the was OK with that. 
After half a year she went studying as well. She learned new people and I was very happy about it. She would get more grown up and that's what is was hoping for her. But, as she said afterwards, she got bored with me. But she didn't want to break up. I thought everything was still OK. When the next event happend. 
She wanted me to come with her to church for Christmas. You must understand, I've never been to a church before. At least not as a not tourism thing. So after a few I thought we'll off course, for her I will. 
So I went with her and her family. And I think it was one of the worst things I've been too. Like the priester would got on and on about how people should live more closely to the Bible. People didn't respect it as much. And I was sitting there, not even red a bible, not even a few words. 
Afterwards there was no thank you from her. She didn't look amused. So later that day after dinner I asked what was going on. We took a walk and then she said she wanted to break up. She didn't had explanation. She just wanted to be single. 
I was devastated, didn't see it coming. I was high up there and suddenly everything was pulled away underneath me. Most of you will probably know how it's feels to be dumped without knowing it was coming. 
I asked her if there was someone else. She promised there wasn't, but off course there was. There was this guy is her class I hadn't heard a lot about him, but I knew who he was. I found out because she was still logged in on my pc and saw all her recent chats. 
Again the trust in someone completely shattered. But I was still head over heels. So I kept trying. 4 months later we started dating again, but there was no trust. I doubted everything she would say I didnt believe a word she would say. 
Its hard to life like this. And I've seen some dark sides of my self that I hope never have to see again. This lasted almost a year then she wanted to go to her father in South Africa. And that's when I said we should break up. This isn't going to work. At this time it was mutual, but trust didn't restore. 

A year later I got a girlfriend again  it was fun at all, but I believe I wasn't in love with her. 

After a while my oldest sister would drop her contact what she had with our mom. She didn't want to hear anything about it anymore. To be honest, I don't know what the last straw was. I do remember her arguing in the car, and me waiting on the outside till she was done. 

My connection to my mother is nihil. Almost absent, she never apologized to me personally and never asks why I never call or something. It's like she's not bothered by the fact that she feel like an aunt or even a distant relative. When the divorce happened there was this big drama about money possession and such. 
My dad was crazy enough to pay for her motorcycle license. I don't know ow anymore why this happens, but it did. My mother didn't want to help my dad with keeping the household running. He was paying the mortgage on its own and even provided everything for me. He could barely come around. The hard part for me was that she didn't want the help my dad, knowing he was providing for me. That's how much I'm worth to my mother I guess. The though nothing more. This one stings, and is one that keeps on getting back. 

When I broke up with my second girlfriend one of my friends hurt me like damn hard. I was close to him, he was a very good friend of my. I losend a little bit. Did talk a bit about my parents, just barley. When his birthday came around he didn't invite me to come over or anything. Apparently was the brother of my ex more important he got to go, I had to hear from someone else. I'd expected that he'd atleast let me know, but nothing. After I asked he said that I would maybe had a hard time with it. Him not even asking was kinda a slap in my face and I left it at that. I'm not saying this is his fault but this adds up to the pile of things I can't seem to process. Now you might think this isnt that big of a deal, but only having 4 real friends, missing one is hard. 

And soon enough after graduating the other friends faded as well. The current count is 1 and I don't anyway how I can get that number up anymore. 

Work is the only positive in my life though. I'm good at it. Colleagues look up to me and it comes easy to me. There is also this one colleague. I was very close with her. Told here some dark thoughts. She seemed to listen, so at one point I tried. I tried to reach out but it didn't work. I told her I'm in a hole and can't get out. I told her the I don't see anything positive about even being here. She listened and listened. Afterwards she said  what about this other colleague? Can't you talk with him also? And didn't hear anything from her for a few weeks. Not even the question, jeez how are you doing? Are you as OK as that smile your putting on? This really hurts because I was kinda hoping we could have been friends. But all that I'm for her is a colleague, and never will be more. 
This time I reached out, it took so much energy. Months after it happened I 'woke up' again. Can't recall any that happened in that period. I know that I was done and decided I needed a change. 
I decided I'd go to China for a few weeks, went there, and life felt great. I was able to make friends. To myself I looked social again. For a few week my dark side could near me. 
I was sleeping in hostels and contact with people was so easy and fun to do. But this only lasted as long as my vacation lasted. Getting back was hard, after just a week I felt down again. Seeing her at work reminded me of everything I wanted but wasn't able to. The next month's are not recorded again. I was asleep. 

When I traveled to China I stopped in dubai. Here I met a girl. We met trough Tinder(I know right). But she is amazing. She always is there for me and really helped me out quite some times. The only bad thing, she isn't close. I can't just go to her, which in many many cases I wish I could. 

This not recording or sleeping is something is hard to explain. I don't know when I'm a sleep. I do know when I'm awake. When I'm awake if always feel like I want it to change. These are also the times I talk alot with the girl from dubai. I like to think she really understands me. She close enough I can open up, but lives far away, so I'm less scared she would breake my trust.

By now you might think, you had 4 friends 2 faded, one ended, where is this last friend in all of this. Why is he one of persons you talk to when you're awake, how comes he doesn't know. Well it's simple, for one he's to close. I don't need to show my trust if I don't let him see anything is wrong. Don't get me wrong, I'm greatfull he is my friend, but I don't want to put trust in something I'm not sure off. He has this believe that state of mind is fully controlled by your self, if you don't want to feel it you'll not feel it and there won't be it. Take sadness for example, if you don't want to feel sad you'll not be sad if you don't let it. Quite strong character you can say, but it also makes that he has less feel for empathy. He won't ask because he doesn't wants to seround himself with bad feelings. And I belive he would see a cry out for help for what it really is. Can't blame him, I would steer away as well if I knew what was coming I guess. 

So by now you'll probably think that this isn't this hard and they are just things I need to process or just let it be because I can't influence anything of it. Maybe you're right, but try to see through my perspective. I'm having a serious trust issue and I'm withholding my self of being social with any one new, so it's kinda hard to process it on my own. 

So I talked about the whole social part. This is one of the things om not anymore. I feel like since I graduated I can't converse with anyone new. I find it hard to come up with questions to ask. It's hard because it always feels I'm not interesting enough for the other person. Plus it always feels my common knowledge is going as far as the most of them. Maybe this varies per location, or group of persons. I don't feel like this with my best friend, I do feel like it when someone new gets introduced to me or with anyone at work. The only one who doesn't bring up that feeling is the colleague I've spoken off before. 

The only thing that is left behind are my thoughts. My thoughts and I have been locked up with each other for quite some time now. And they do collide every now and then. Sometimes my thoughts wants everything to stop. And not just the thinking but just everything. Feeling nothing, being nothing. And the only nothing I know, is something I don't want. I still believe that there is something to stay for. My thoughts just think otherwise.
