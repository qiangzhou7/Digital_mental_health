Like ""youre selfish"" or ""that thing you do is weird/gross"" or something like that? Its always been really hard for me to describe this experience but its the one thing that makes me cry almost every time, depending on how close the person is to me. and it happened again recently. its horrible how it feels.

basically not even having  confidence in your own traits and then being told you're the thing you DONT want to be and thought you were 100% not... like you FINALLY have a shred of happiness about youself but then youre told you dont even have that

This song is pretty much my theme song.

I also enjoy Black and Death Metal a lot.
Behemoth, Shade Empire, Dimmu Borgir, Hate. Great bands.

Since I am usually not happy, I rather sit and listen to music that is about death, destruction, hatred, pain, misanthorpy, war, and satanism. All the dark shit.
I sound like some dumb edgy kid, but music like this gives me peace.
It fits in with usually how I feel.
If I try to be social, I just push people away. Making new friends or find a girlfriend is pointless.
Silence is beautiful. My shitty voice will ruin whatever conversation is taking place.  I should have my vocal cords removed.

I don't have the grades for any university, and community college will be a waste of time.

I'm trying to build one now that I realize that, like develop interests and such, but it's a slow process and I've never ever been good at making friends. It's like, to make friends, I have to put myself out there, but when I put myself out there, I just suck at it. I am not present.

I have a few ideas how to meet people and rebuild my life, like a local place that offers drop in support groups or meetup.com but I just feel so lost. I haven't graduated college and my boyfriend of two years just broke up with me, and my whole social support network revolved around him. I'm not used to being on my own.

_____________________________


Hey, everyone. 


I understand that in the past year or so, I've been pretty distant and non-communicative in person and over the Internet. This is no fault of your own, and I'm not a smug elitist bastard - or, at least, I try to avoid being that. For a long time, I've been afflicted with depression and it's affected every area of my life. It might seem obvious to a few of you, but even then, it's so scary to admit it. I'm afraid no one is going to give a shit, or think that I'm looking for dramatic attention. Hell, it's just a bad idea to come forth, because no one wants to deal with that kind of additional stress. I've lost or damaged relationships in the past trying to get people to understand, but all I did was bring them down with me, drowning them in the details. 


It's not an excuse for me to be a shitty friend, though, and it's definitely not a good idea to let it manifest in cutting people out - people that have supported me, that I've had good times with. I don't expect your sympathy, trust, support, or understanding, even. I just want to be a better person for you all. 


I imagined how other people would imagine their own funeral. Maybe you want a dramatic crowd, maybe you want your intimate friends and family surrounding your casket. It scares me to think I might have zero people around to remember me as someone worthy of being called a friend, or worthy of sharing a bloodline and a name. It scares me to think that the only recollection someone might have of me is a two sentence tidbit, and not a pleasant one at that. So I'm sorry. I'll be better. Tell me if I'm not, and if you could so kindly give me advice to be a better person along the way, you have my gratitude. If you want to talk or message me, let's catch up. 


P.S. If you post some unfunny ""crippling depression"" meme in response, then I'll have zero remorse actually cutting you off.",5,"depression , drive people away, shitty friend to people, stess, lost damaged relationshops"

"THIS IS A FOLLOW UP TO MY PREVIOUS POST

I always thought school was the real life version of hell,until I got my one month holidays,and started feeling dead,and super depressed,partly caused by loneliness,so at that point,I was desperate to get back to school,and I missed my classmates/cunts so much.

The day came,2/1/17,The start of school,I was just moved up to grade/primary six,and we now sit in pairs instead of groups,well,at least I thought...

out of the 39 students in my class,I was the unlucky one who got to sit alone,I mean,the teacher could just make one of the pairs into three people,but know,I was alone,at the back. What was so disgusting about this is that my teacher wanted me to be more social for a very long time,and yet she chose to let me sit alone and die inside,even when there are so many choices to get me together with other classmates/cunts.

Not only that,My co-form teacher asked me if I was fine,and I had to say yes,since I was the 'invisible' kid in the class and no one cared for me,and if I said no,I know for a fact that she would just call me a complain king,fucking fuck.

Now this part is the most painful to sit through,A girl that I liked and had her existence very much appreciated by me,was right in front of me,she had a partner,one that I thought was very childish and a trouble maker,I have to go through SEVEN miserable hours seeing them talk in the most amiable ways,while I just sit back in my area,having my soul to deteriorate by the seconds.

Well,at least she is happy,fuck I want to die.

Oh yeah,I also had to lie to my parents that I was doing fine for my first day,since I know they wouldn't do shit,Fuck yes,Back to school is fun,everybody!",5,"thought school was hell, holidays were were super depressed, desparate to go school, sat alone in class, no one caes, the girl I  like does not acknowlege existance"
"I am so sick of being depressed. When I was a kid, I was happy and never let anything keep me down. When there was a problem, I solved it, simple as that. Now I get depressed and contemplate suicide. I can't take it anymore; I am so sick of being disappointed in myself. I'm sick of always being too afraid to act. 

Maybe I am a failure and maybe I never will amount to anything, but how will I know if I never try or believe in myself. I will use my nihilism to succeed and be happy. This is the only life I've got, and someday I'll be dead and forgotten. So why waste it being sad. No longer will I romanticize my depression and let it get the better of me.

"Started a self defense class in November. Have gone 2 times. Took 3 weeks off. They probably think it's for the holidays but I was sick. I hate the class. I feel inept and like a complete dumb ass but one kid gave me some respect and shook my hand so that felt good. It's mostly guys in there so I feel like there's less of the fakeness you would get from women. 

I think I would like the class if I were good at it and felt like I fit in better, but I'm completely self-conscious and I suck at some of the moves they teach us. I got owned by a couple teenagers the first week I went, made me feel like crap. 

I've never been much into sports. I deeply wish that someone would've taken time out of their day to help me understand sports or develop my athleticism but no one did. 

This kinda feels the way church used to. The longer I would skip out on church, the less likely I would be to go back and the more guilty I would feel. 

I do have other stuff to do. I think I'm about to lose my job so I could apply for jobs, I could play video games, I could learn how football works, workout...

I have for awhile had this weird thing were I separate my concious and subconscious and end up conversing with myself. I don't always agree with myself thow and sometimes contradict myself in weird ways. my subconscious will be scared but I won't be scared. that doesn't make sense. I will talk and act one way but then the next day act as if I am someone else.



ussually Iignore myself but my subconscious (I nicknamed it sub so I will refere to it as that) tells me to stop. this is hard to explain so if you want to know more you can ask but for now I am going to move on.


I don't think I am that good of a person, I have a strange desire ti physically and/or mentally hurt others. I try to put this at bay with things like video games and drawing (I draw alot of violence) but I still don't know why its there and it won't go away.



I gett very lonely but never want to interact with others. I'm very asocial a bit more than just being introverted. 

I don't like telling people about my feelings because I don't like being vunlerable. I get anxiety at random times and sometimes fear for my life when I am alone for no reason.



I don't feel happy nor sad but I don't know if I want to change this. I lack motivation even to do things I like.I get frustrated and angry when I make mistakes and often give up easily.

"Hello everyone, first time in this subreddit, not really sure though if this is a right one to tell my problem, so excuse me if it isn't.
Don't really know where to start. Thought what I wanted to write and it flowed like water in my head but it is a little harder to organize it properly here, so I will try to explain my situation as best I can.

Long text ahead.

I am generally a closed person, 25yo male, I have a few friends and some of them are really good. I can't make friends easily nor hold proper a conversation when meeting a stranger. I ussually cut it off quickly, especially with a woman and it feels to me that I act like I am in a hurry and it usually feels I don't really care about what they have to tell me about themselves and act like that, whether it's a man or woman. I am not impolite or anything like that, i just can't keep the conversation flowing. Sometimes when I consiously want to talk with acquaintances or try to meet someone new, I just don't know what to say, usually in this case because I don't want to insult them somehow and I end up not saying anything or very few, resulting sometimes in akward silences.

I just started on a temporary work 3 months ago moved from my small hometown to a big city. It took me, I think a lot of time to start getting comfortable around my coworkers (as most times). All of them seem funny, good and open people that won't get offended by anything I would say, either to get to know them better or just to make some fun on our break. But they are not really the case on why I am writing this.

My problem mostly lies after my work on me socializing with other people. I generally enjoy sitting alone in my house, spending time in the copmuter mostly, or doing the daily chores and a little exercising. I used to live with my parents before getting the job and I hated being in the house with them (I want to mention here that I don't hate my parents at all, I love them and respect them very much). Spent my time closed in my room on my computer, or outside with the friends I have in my hometown. Which are all male by the way and the closest I have. The few rest that I have in the city that I work are mostly old friends from when I was young that we just kept in touch. Nothing more.

As I see other people in the streets with girlfriends or even being friends with them and I am kind jealous, not in that specific person I see, but on the general relationships that I whitness. I beat my head on how to find a solution on this, but whenever I am invited from some of the friends I have here, I am generally too bored to go out with them and prefer to stay alone. I mostly am bored to go out with them, because they are male friends as well, as I don't know any of their girl friends that hang with. Even if there would be girls in that company, I still propably wouldn't go because of the reasons I described earlier. I would be too bored to get to know them or just wouldn't know what to say, staying completelly passive. I feel kinda sad to myself when I get to take some long walks in the city where I see all these people socializing having relationships. But when I get in the silence if my home, 99% of the times that feeling just goes away

(Kinda TL;DR) I am in a situation where I am content that I stay alone in my house, where I have peace of mind and without having to act fake to talk with people. BUT I also want to find a girlfriend, to try to hang out with the friends that I have here and maybe meet some new, either through my friends or through work but I find it completelly boring/tiring to get in the process to do all that and I just prefer to stay home in the end.

"I'm 14.
For few years i have thought that i'm just really unlucky.

My longest friendship has been only one year and finding or even getting friends is an everyday strugle for me.

It is the thought of thinking that the world would have plenty of problems gone if i wouldn't be alive.

I have a feeling that everyone just hates me. And i should just find my tree and apologize to it for wasting its selfmade air.

My personality moto is ""whatever i own or have touched or is really important to me, is getting ruined, broken or lost""

Today i destroyed so many things without even knowing it and i just thought

What if i crossed the street and a car would ride over me

What if the building sudenly would lose balance and just broke over my head

What if i would slip and crack my head open

What if...


I'm too scared to atempt suicide but i still wanna die... i want it to be an accident 

The thought of death is scary itself but at the same time angelic to me

The only person who i think would give a damn about my life is my best friend

The only person who understands me and listens to me

The only person who can make me smile even if it is the hardest day

Not my mom or dad, i don't even have siblings, but my best friend....


I always thought that the every second possible accident anywhere where i stand is just messed up brain and now i think it's depression.


And I am the only one who knows because i hide beneath a girl with realy colorful hair and a lots of smiles.


But the thing is...
THATS NOT ME",5,"really unlucky, getting friends is struggle, everyone hates me, "
"Before you begin to read, here is some informations about me:
I'm Alex, 15 year old. I live in a small city, so if somebody does something, next week everybody knows about it. 
I'm suffering from depression for I don't know how many years.
I always was the backup person, so I got ignored a lot.
I remember I just sat in the hallway of my school, alone, noone cared about me. Not even the teachers.
I play a lot of video games, isolated from the others, and I have only a few friend that I can play with.

Me: But you have better time playing with ****than me, just asking (because I realise it)
Him: Because we love the same (game) both
Me: Who do you prefer playing with? (me or ***)? This question is in my head for days.
Him: *****
Him: Because he does not complain that much as you.
Me: Accidentally left from teamspeak (it was totally on purpose)
Me: Than have fun playing with *****, in the rest of your life.

What is the right thing to do in this situation? Did I overreacted? I don't know what to do anymore, give me some tips please.",5,"live in a  small city, suffering from depresion, sit in hallway of school alone, no one cared, not even teachers, only friend ignoring"
"Sometimes I feel bad because my depression is not as bad as some people who commit suicide or live in constant agony. Even posting this was hard because I thought people with ""real"" depression should be helped first. 

I have been in and out of depression for the last 10 years. Mostly bouncing between deep apathy where I didn't care about anything and extreme joy and euphoria in  3 month cycles. It all ended about a year ago when instead of apathy and numbness I felt deep sorrow, sadness and grief and got stuck there. No more numbness or euphoria just always feeling sad and wanting to cry but not being able to. Also feeling like there is no hope in regards to any aspect of my life. I almost never leave home in the last 2-3 month except to get food and run errands, luckily I work from home and I really avoid all human contact except my girlfriend. I even stopped responding to calls/texts from friends because I feel like no one really understands what I'm going through and everyone just wants to say ""ohh toughen up, life's hard, get your shit together, stop feeling mopy"".  My work is suffering since I cant really concentrate on it and Im worried I might loose it. I feel deep shame and regret because I achieved nothing in the last 10 years of my life (my 20s) nor did I have any fun most of my peers had. 

I feel like I cant go on like this because its a horrible place to be stuck in and I want to seek help but I am confused where to start. 

Should I looks for a psychologist or psychiatrist ? I dont have suicidal thoughts I'm just really scared I will live like this for the rest of my life. Is my condition psychological or physiological ? Is there a test to take ? I'm really against anti depressants due to the scary side effects but I'm opening up to the idea slowly if I know 100% that that's he only way for me to get better. 

Are there any resources I should check out ? I really dont know where to start. I appreciate any help I can get.

"I feel like like I'm always running away from something and, at the same time, striving and longing for something else I don't even know what. It is like a videogame where you are always facing the final boss or feel it coming right around the corner, while simultaneously gathering supplies and ammo.

"First of all I just need to get this out of my body, you dont have to read it or reply.

To begin with this was really horrible month for me. 
Besides all my bad emotions I can still actually enjoy things, still do something. I met a girl, she is really interesting and cares about me, you know that goth girl into David Bowie and Oasis era, freeminded smart and everything. I kinda needed this, someone who would fullfill my desires and bring te burried passions from me. I WANT TO LIKE HER, but my mind keeps tellin me its not enough like i dont need it, all my mind cares about is pleassure, to feel god. This relationship kills me. She likes my hair, but I am losing one side which makes me totally depressed I can't even count things i avoided because of it, keep checking if another fall, keep looking at them. I am also really skinny and my pose sucks so hard i hope she doesnt care... She invited me like before Christmas to sleepover oh boy i was so glad even i wasnt thinking we could have together something, I mean its awesome to drink a bit and spent nigh with someone you like watch movies listen to music and stuffs. We got kinda drunk and she asked me to kiss her so i did, I didnt need to have sex with her even I kinda wanted to try it for first time but it was ok, i just took of her bra and we had great time.

Next day i was happiest human on earth, trust me, pure euphoria. but i started overthinking it which was a huge mistake I mean we was drunk. I met her today again to make it clear for my mind I think she again enjoyed time spend with me then we kissed and It actually felt again good kinda weird but good... anyway i was depressed, melanholic and tired from everything i wasnt able to enjoy it. She cares about me, she likes me but i dont really think I am able to.

Drugs. I smoke for 1,5 to compress somehow everything, i know its bad i hate myself for it. I tried to stop few times but i felt like it wasnt me, i didnt feel addicted i jsut felt dead inside. Ive been drinking sometimes with friends and hell its so good, i still think about being drunk because its so good feel and that scares the shiit out of me jesus i am afraid, really afraid. We used to in this cold make firecamp drink and chill and trust me, those were best days ive ever head, spent time with people i like people who likes me and know me.. i never felt more happy than this birthday (turned 17 this motnh) cause we enyojed it together.

I was never like most of people (not into way am different) I had not like favourite sport i did long time, i have not hobbies, interests... ive never felt blithely. All i do is listen to music and surf net. I feel like i know every good band and i am afraid i wont find another :( 
Ive got bad grades, my parents and grandparent hates me for that. I hate myself for that but with my status i cant do anything, trust me. My best friend is lazy and addicted to weed, other i dont like that much and they are also lazy, well im too but i wish i could enjoy myself more. do stuffs, see shits.
I wish i was able to work and make some money but im too psychicaly exhausted its impossible.

I feel ill, do i need a help? I cant describe how i feel, its horrible..i sometiems fantazire about killing myself, i wouldnt do it, but i FUCKIN WISH I KNEW how it feels to be dead. ANYTHING than this really.

Also my grandfather died who i never liked, all he cared about was my grades. My mom woke me up with this massage and i didnt feel a bit sad, I felt empathy for parents and grandma but nothing else... it destroys me i have to write this but my mind was thinking about stuffs he left so i could get it. That day we had after christmas lunch and all they were talking about was funeral and how I should learn and learn things to avoid bad stuffs. From that time my mind got seed that like when i grow older i wil jsut piss out of family and forget on everything.

i need to listen music loud, I am getting addicted to anything what would let me get out of every emotion.

"Im a 19 year old currently in University, im only really here because my parents told me it would be best for me to go.

"And that'll never change.I could struggle to death to change something or not do anything at all, and things would be exactly the same.As you can tell, I have nothing, I am nothing.At this point, I'd be a fool if I thought there's any hope left for a loser like me.My teenage years felt like they weren't there in the first place.Never been to a party, a date, never got a driver's licence while everyone was posting pictures and congratulating each other after managing to do so on the first try(because I failed the test 4 times as I'm a stupid loser, not because of money), spent every single day on the computer as there's literally NOTHING else I could(and can) do and lastly never achieved anything meaningful while I was in school.After all, I guess this screen I've been staring at since forever is the only thing that keeps me going.But I guess this type of loser(that is me of course) needs to exist so that others can feel even better about themselves.

"It's 01:12am right now.

I haven't eaten in 2 days. I smoke two packs a day. The most sleep I've gotten in one night was 4 hours. I get stupid stoned every night. I don't care whether I lose my job after being unemployed for a year. I'm being pressured to live up to certain expectations. I sometimes drink a whole bottle on a week day just to see if that doesn't get me killed. I constantly imagine ways I could die from things i see on my way to work. I feel nothing yet I'm constantly terrified. I crave intimate contact but I always push those away that try and get close to me. I hate that it feels like people think I'm disgusting. Unattractive. No confidence. A burden. I saw a co-worker break down in tears today after hearing her father passed. I wished someone would cry like that for me.

Let me just say I have the job I've been wanting since i graduated in 2012. The people I work with are the best people I've worked with so far. I've made many friends the past 2 years. My artwork has started to become popular on social media. Financially I'm quite stable. I kissed the girl I've liked for a while on New Year's Eve.

Yet it seems there is no point to any of the good or the bad. Nothing matters. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing will save me.

It's time I did something about the pain, so that it's finally over. Whoever reads this, please don't bother to comment anything supportive or encouraging. Save your time on something more meaningful",5,"not eaten for 2 days, smoked 2 packs, stoned, pressurized to live upto expectations, carve intiamte contact, people feel I'm disgusting, unattractive, no confidence, noting makes me happy"
"I've been with depression for about a year now and right now I think I am at my worst. The thoughts of ending it all are going through my head more than I've ever had it before and it's because I have a solution to my pain but that solution will only cause more pain for me in a different way. I don't know what to do and I feel like I need some help. 

My decision revolves around my religion. I am a member of the LDS church and have been all my life. I was raised with it and I believed in it to the full extent. However nowadays church is a pain to go to and anything having to do with god is like a pin prodding at me. Church has turned into a shaming session where when I do go I hear the speakers talk about certain things and I always come to the decision that they are talking to me and pointing out what I should be doing. Even in Sunday school I feel like that's happening. So to avoid this I go to church and play on my phone the whole time which is not the point of being their in the first place. So I feel like I go and ruin the next couple days for myself or I go and feel like a rude asshole for not paying attention when I'm in class or in sacrament. 

So the solution to this problem is obviously just not going but I fear that the things that will come of that will destroy me and my family even more. My dad is very connected to the religion and heir already seeing my falling away and I can tell he's disappointed. I feel like I'm failing him and that leaving will only make it worse. Not only that is there my brother who is unstable and has anger and control issues who I think that if I leave he will follow. That is not what he needs and I think the church is the best thing for him so the idea of him leaving is not something I want to see happen. Not only that but if he leaves my father will probably be even more disappointed not only for me But for my brother. 

I need to come to a decision here but both options are awful. I can either be selfish and leave while ruining my family in the process or stay and endure my pain and hatred of myself for the rest of my life. I have lost hope in myself and hopefully you guys have some idea what to do cause I'm sitting in bed crying over this situation.

"Hello r/depression, I have been staring at my phone trying to call the samaritans (UK helpline) for the last hour. But I can't work up the courage to actually speak to a person so I came here. I've been wanting to kill myself recently; and the multi-storey car park I could jump from is a 15 minute walk away. Recently the temptation to go there is getting strong. 
The only time in my life where I don't feel constantly pushed down on by a crushing weight is now, when I'm in bed. When I'm at work I feel like everyone is against me or wants me out. I bumble through my day only speaking when spoken to, and everyone looks at me very disdainfully. I feel like I am always being ridiculed and watched for any mistake. I feel like they gossip and bicker about me behind my back, and will jump on any opportunity to force me out.
I come home and I am responsible for my younger sister who is 18 and doesn't have much time for me. My mother lives with us but she not able to help due to suffering from mental illness. I make a dinner for my family and then have no choice but to be alone. I am so lonely I feel like I could cry.
I am 28, and the last time I had a girlfriend I was 19. I can't see how I can continue living being this miserable. Only the thought of my sister being upset stops me, but I'm beginning to think she wants me gone also. 
I don't sleep much anymore, and I feel very isolated from everything. My general thoughts have a kind of far away feeling to them. I can only deduce that I am severely depressed, so I am posting here.

"I moved to a new city away from my family and friends and ex-SO for the greatest job opportunity I could ask for right out of college. And somewhere along the line of my first real week of days off, I realized that all I did was work and I was just curled up in bed every second I was not working. I've thrown myself into a job so completely that I didn't even realize I stopped eating and slept too much. Now I'm back at work, and I didn't realize how lonely I felt being so far away from everyone I ever cared for. It's just a part of growing up, right? But I can't help but break down in the middle of my work day and lock myself in a bathroom trying to breathe. I've suffered from depression my entire life, but it has never been this bad. I've lost over 20 lbs and I was already only 5 foot and 110 lbs. And my apartment is pristine because no area but my bedroom has been used. It's been 6 months of this. 

I'm giving up and trying not to give up at the same time, if that makes sense. I decided to come home from work early today and cook myself a decent meal for lunch tomorrow, and it's the first thing I can say I'm proud of actually doing, but I feel pathetic at the same time. That that was all it took.

"I've been unhappy for a very long time. I am in high school and I'm currently on my winter break. I've hated school for the last 6 or so years. 

Even though I despise it, I generally do pretty well. In elementary school, I got 90's and stuff without much difficulty. But when I started high school, my marks were a lot lower and I realized I'm not smart like I thought I was. It took me until the last semester of grade 10 until I was satisfied with my grades. I got all 90s and I was pretty proud of myself. I even won an award for history. 

Now I'm in grade 11 and I'm getting 90s in every course except music. I actually am getting a 60% which was the lowest mark I have ever gotten in a course. I'm pretty devastated because I have been practising like crazy. My teacher is also pretty considerate and let me redo a few things which I continued to fuck up. If you are in music, you have to take band which I enjoy. But this year you have to take it twice a week. One of the days I have to stay at school until 7 pm and I always feel really sad after. I'm just not enjoying it anymore. I know I probably shouldn't take it next year, but it feels like such a waste since I've devoted so much time to playing my instrument. I just feel so shitty. The class average is a 91. I am pretty sure I'm getting the lowest mark in the class.

I enjoy getting high marks, but I am a horrible procrastinator and I always stay up to like 5 am working on assignments. I have no motivation until I absolutely need to get stuff done. I just feel horrible when I get low marks. Everyone at my school is uber competitive and I feel like garbage if I get anywhere below a 90. I hardly pay attention in class and I always save things until the last minute. It's like I enjoy making my life more difficult. School has gotten harder and the stress causes me to cry often.

I don't have a girlfriend, and I don't have very strong connections with any of my friends. I don't enjoy going places with people. And I feel uncomfortable talking to them outside of emails, texts, and Facebook messaging. One of my friends always makes jokes at my expense when we're around other people. I often make self-deprecating jokes, so I am normally okay with it. But he takes it a little too far sometimes. I'm not the best at controlling my emotions -- I smile and laugh at inappropriate times -- so when I try to tell him I don't enjoy it, he says that I'm lying.

A couple years ago I ended a friendship with an absolutely toxic person. I'm glad I ended it, but he was also one of the only people from my old school. I really felt betrayed by what he did to me, and it still kinda hurts. I don't have many friends.

Every single day is the same old bullshit. I just sit there at school waiting for it to be time for me to go home. And then I go home and do nothing until it's like midnight and I need to do my homework. I hate my routine, I wanted some sort of change. But then I got some change and I hate it so much.

A week before the winter break started I found out that my mom has breast cancer. I'm scared and sad. I'm trying to remain optimistic but it doesn't look good. I had to spend that last week in class while my mom got subsequent testing. It was awful to have to wait all day at school. The worst was when one of her meeting with an oncologist was on the same day I had band. I had to wait until 7 until I found out anything. That's when I found out that she would be going through chemotherapy and then eventually surgery.

I had a history test that week. I'm sure I didn't fail it, but I don't think I got higher than a 90. This sucks because history was my best course and I felt proud of myself for once. And now I feel guilty for worrying about something as petty as a test.

Now it's over a week into the break and I'm just wallowing in self-pity. I barely leave the bed. My passions are to read comics, watch movies, and I'm trying to write a screenplay. For the first few days of the break, I was mildly productive. But now I don't even do anything. I have so much to read but not enough energy to actually do it. I am wasting my break.

We found out that her cancer spread to her bones. They aren't going to have surgery anymore. She is going to go through months of chemo in hopes that they will just make the cancer controllable. Best case scenario, it's a lifetime condition that they just need to closely monitor. Luckily, the chemo that she is going through isn't as intense, so she is not incapacitated. She's still working and stuff. Her hair will still likely fall out in a week or 2. She has an MRI and a CT scan on Friday -- we'll know if it has spread to any organs. 

My sister is in town from university. I haven't really talked about it much with my sister or my dad. My dad seems like he is trying to ignore the whole thing. We're not the most talkative family.

I tried talking to a friend who doesn't go to my high school. He is extremely unhelpful. He barely reads the messages I send him. A week ago, I told him my mom was starting chemo the next day. And he immediately changed the subject to what he bought on Boxing Day. I get that it's awkward, but all I was looking for was a friend to talk to. I didn't message him again until today. I was also pissed that he didn't think of messaging me to ask how things were going with my mom. He was going through his own personal shit a few months ago, and I listened and tried to be a friend. I feel like this friendship is extremely one sided and I need to end it.

I love my sister, but she keeps on pressuring me to get my G1. I know I should, however, I just have no motivation whatsoever. And I feel like I would be an incompetent driver. I constantly fuck things up. I can barely get motivated to study for a test at school. I know driving isn't necessary at the moment, so I can't get motivated to study for it.

School is starting again on Monday. I'm going to have so much work to do because exams start at the end of January. I have so much work that I could be doing over the break, but I just keep putting it off. I have a group video or something due for history sometime after the break. My group wants to start filming Thursday or Friday. On Thursday, my mom has chemotherapy. And on Friday, my mom has more tests. Even if I do get a ride to someone's house, I'm going to be thinking of my mom all day. I don't want to be a jerk and screw over my group. But I really don't want to film those days. Also, I'm really not close to anyone in that group to tell them what's going on. It would be really uncomfortable telling them and I don't know what other day we could film. I also can't get motivated to do any work or research. 

I don't want school to start again. I hate it. It's so stressful and I'm so unhappy. I had so little motivation before I discovered my mom has cancer, and now I have even less. I know I'm going to have a shitty time.

I am starting to realize how screwed I am for university. I don't really have any accomplishments. I've done nothing significant. My only highlights are my grades, but they are not even that great and I don't know if I can keep them up. I want to be a screenwriter, yet I know that it is nearly impossible to be successful. I just know that I'm going to fail at it like everything else in my life.

I don't have anyone to talk to. I feel alone and scared. I'm not suicidal (there are too many movies and television shows to look forward to even think about that). I am not very charismatic. Or athletic. Or smart. I doubt anyone will even read this.

"I know right. The feels. I don't expect any responses. I just like this subreddit because it's good to get your thoughts out there every now and then. I reread all of this and I wrote way too much. It's basically just an essay about my current state of mind in regards to mostly romantic relationships. Normal relationships are a whole other story.

There is something fundamentally wrong with me. It's not even part of my depression I think. It's part of me. I don't feel human because I don't think I contribute anything to society, and what seems to be a lack of wanting to interact with society.

Am I okay with being alone? I like being alone. I will have a twinge of loneliness occasionally. I'm sure if I didn't have my online friends I would feel loneliness more. I feel like I lead two lives. A social life online, and a lone loser irl.

I'm wondering what is stopping me from finishing my okc profile. I don't want to put the pictures on there. I don't want to write anything positive about myself. But most of all I don't want to interact with any of them. I don't want to meet anyone.

And I don't think it's just a fear of men. I think it's a fear of people in general. What good are they to me? Relationships with real people are too complicated too exhausting. Making conversation is excruciating. I become way too invested in other people and they don't reciprocate. It's painful.

Physical contact scares me. But I want it at the same time too. I have memories of being very young and wanting to be carried. But no one would carry me. My dad would carry my sister then be too tired to carry me. I grew to hate touch. I hated it when distant relatives would visit and want to hug me or kiss me. My parents barely ever did that so why should some strangers.

The best days I've had recently have been the ones where I have been completely alone, completely uncontacted by family. And I usually spend them alone in my apartment. Like a zoo display.

Love and companionship. I crave it and hate it at the same time. I go through periods of extreme sexual frustration where I long to have a partner. But the thought of doing something so intimate with another human frightens me at the same time. Sex is a mystery to me still, at 26 years old. I've watched porn, I've read erotic fiction. I've read about techniques and experiences others have had. I can do things that are close enough with other people online. But the thought of meeting in person to do anything is scary. I've had opportunities but I don't want to follow through with them.

When I was 14, I had an online boyfriend. He lived a few hours away and we wanted to meet eventually (although even then I had my reservations). He was 4 years older than me. My parents knew nothing about him. When he called my house my mom yelled at him and told him to leave me alone. We pretty much broke up after that. I felt ashamed and stupid and very bad that I caused someone else pain at the same time. I worried my parents and I fucked up the guy. Can't do anything right. Anyway I believe that first ""love"" of mine, and its conclusion, left an impression on me. The worst part might've been that after the incident, my parents never really could talk to me about it. They would try and I would deny it because I didn't trust them. And they kind of just dropped it. Maybe it was worse in the end because it seemed like they didn't give a fuck and went back to doing whatever it is they do instead of parenting.

After that first one I fooled around here and there, and had a second serious boyfriend when I was about 16-17. He was 6 years older than me, and lived across the country. He was very sweet and never pressured me to meet up or anything. I know there's also the element of me being a minor and them being older. I was never abused though. Maybe emotionally confused at times.

These little contained online relationships satisfied me well enough. I could get emotional companionship and sexual release. Usually without having to see their face or have them see me. After those two I've dabbled in similar more casual encounters if I ever feel the need.

The only real life thing that happened was freshman year of college. There was a guy I found cute. He was in 90% of my classes. It seemed like he was flirting with me because he was always distracting me from my notes, and sitting next to me in lecture halls. I hugged him once, and felt really fucking awkward and hated it. My height. My height is awkward. But that's only a contributing factor. It's that it's unnatural to me. That whole stint ended badly with me putting myself out there and getting fucked over. And my way of getting over it was to cut him out of my life as much as I could, and apparently to give up on looking good and gain 20 lbs lol!

So why should I make a dating profile where I'm expected to meet them in person. It's not necessary. If I don't I won't have to risk being hurt or revealing how awkward I am. This whole profile business seems disingenuous. I misrepresent myself because in words/online I can seem amazing. I'm okay at taking pictures that make me look halfway decent. But I realized I look awful irl. And my personality does not match up. I'm pathetically ""shy"" you could call it; or just mentally ill. I hate having to write positive things about myself to make it seem like I'm all gung ho for dating and human interaction. I don't want to sell that false image. Then one day they just realize that I am just a big bundle of depression and anxiety. A burden they weren't signed on for.

I kind of digressed fro the original topic I wanted to dissect. I am not physically attracted to most people. I can find women beautiful sometimes. And recognize when someone meets society's standards of beauty/sexiness. This has torn me up inside for years. I'm so confused about my sexuality. Men are hardly ever physically attractive, but I enjoy their companionship. Women like I said are only rarely. For the most part, I can only be attracted to people if I know them for a while and get to know their personality.

I'm at a stage where people are just trouble to me. I don't want to deal with it. They've hurt me too much in the past so I guess it's that I've learned to stay away. Self preservation. I'm not a risk taker. I have not had many positive interactions with people. I try too hard to fit in. I just want to be unnoticed.

When I was younger I had fantasies of becoming a functioning adult. In my fantasy I would've already been married and had kids by now. I don't think that will ever happen. And I've pretty much accepted that and don't really care any more.

I think its this unenhanced version of sexual/emotional frustration that prevents me from trying harder to assimilate with society. To pursue the role of a lover or my ""endgame fantasies."" I know I would make an amazing girlfriend/wife/mother. I would devote my life to my potential loved ones. I'm probably the perfect fit for some gamer guy out there (minus my depression and anxiety and secret desire for constant attention). But it just doesn't seem worth the trouble of going through the motions to get there. What's the point?

What would even make me happy any more? My ideal life at the moment is sitting alone in my apartment, and I know that's unhealthy.",5,"something is funamentaly wrong with me, dont feel human, okay being alone, twige of lonliness, lead two lives, not fear of men, fear of humans, sexual frustration but avoid intimacy,"
"I'm so fucking sad all of the time and being lonely helps not one bit. I want to be accepted, be invited places, do things. I don't want to be constantly excluded. I just want to be happy, but I can't because of how much I suck. My ""friends"" all hate me, I'm good at nothing, I'm sad, I'm an idiot, I'm socially awkward, ugly, fat, and annoying. I'm honestly garbage. I'm such a fucking loser. I wouldn't hang out with me either. Can't wait to fucking kill myself.",5,"sad all of the times, being lonely does not help, want to be happy, friends hate me, socially awakward, ugly anfd fat"
"Hi guys. Not sure where to start.

I hate school. I am a Junior and I am a straight A student who takes harder classes. You might think that would make me tolerate school, but I absolutely abhor it. I take no pleasure in my success, I have a bad anxiety disorder which will often debilitate me. I recently transferred for reasons I will talk about later. Because I'm new, I have no close relationships with anyone, and it's honestly understandable considering the people in my classes either feel extremely douchey or disinterested. I was never good at making friends IRL anyways I guess, I always tried to keep my social life online. I hate my teachers too, they'll often make me feel like they're under-qualified and that I am not getting the material I will need for the exam. I wish I could drop-out, I really really do, but I have no justification if I'm doing well. I'm almost off Holiday break and I have never been more anxious in my life.

My parents literally do not know the pain and discourse they are putting me through. They recently bought their dream property and they've made me move into the the place and go to school there. My life was put on hold and rapidly changed instantly. The place is in the country and is so isolated; half the time I am there, I am alone. When you're anxious about school and are completely isolated, it is the worst feeling ever, and some days I feel like I am going to die there, unhappy. They thought I would like it as much as them, but I do not. I hate it so much, I just want to be somewhere with good internet, TV, and proximity to civilization. Unfortunately, even when I express my pain, it mostly goes unheard.

I have friends online, and we're all mostly like minded people. For a time, it was great because it was the only place where I felt actually welcomed. We play games together, but I cannot anymore because my parent's new place has satellite internet with data limits. Because of this, I have grown so distant from them. Whenever I can chat, I feel like a waste of space. Only one person has truly expressed interest in what I have to offer socially, but the rest seem distant. I had plans to meet these people, but now, I feel like it is a waste of time. This means my social life is in crisis mode, along with my sanity in my own home and with my patience with school.

I wish I could stop everything and relax. I know life doesn't work that way, but if it doesn't get better, I feel like I will burn out and go crazy. I wish I could stop. I'm probably going to regret making this post in the morning but whatever, I just need someone to acknowledge my pain and maybe give advice. I do go see a counselor but I can never open up. I'm not sure why.",5,"junior and straight A student, abhor school, no cloase relationships with anyone, no social lifewnat to drop out, parents not know of pain and discourse they are putting me through, shifted to new property, I hate it so much, want someone to acknowledge my pain"
"I was trying to express why I'm hesitant to accept help from others, but it's so impossible to really capture the overwhelming urge to run when people express their support for me. So, I tried to draw it instead (it makes me wish I had gotten a taller journal).

Here's a shitty picture of it: http://imgur.com/a/3wWrv

I haven't drawn in months, and only had pens, so obviously I couldn't quite create the image I was feeling in my head, but I feel like something got across. I wanted to post on here where, of course, nobody actually knows me.

Does anyone else feel like this?",5," hesitant to accept help from others, overwhelming urge to run   when people sextend support"
