Mind helping me out on this one? Need it for personal stuff.,0,
"After sitting down and talking with a good friend about the past and the present, 2 years ago I tried to kill myself by jumping off a building, i lived. Seriously mangled my legs and right one still shows but i walk fairly normal and look normal but I legitmately tried to get a gun to just end it. 
I sat down and realized I can live on. Alone and sad and with regret, but live on.
Starting 2017 im going to get mental help and finally come to terms with my choices.

To those out their who suffer and are unable to put it together my heart goes out to you for every time we wake up and we go to bed
when we smile and when we cry. Our loved ones see the smiles and the laughter maybe even see us fall and always stay with us.

Stay strong this year and look forward.",0,
"in addition to 3 a few hours ago. Respiratory depression and shallow breathing here I come. I don't know why it's my preferred self harm. It is. I'm upset. Talking specifics doesn't matter anymore. I'm not coping well, fucking alone. I guess I just wanted tot ell someone",0,
"I've noticed that I tend to smile when the topic of suicide or self-harm comes up, or things related to those. I was in the process of a psych admission when the SW talking to me pointed out that I was smiling while we were discussing a suicide note I left in my wallet. I was just watching a YouTube video of a gamer, and the game hinted at a relative of the main character cutting herself and I smiled. Why in the hell do I do this? It's not funny, I don't find it humorous. I know it's not me being uncomfortable, because I just clam up when I am.",0,
"Usually nothing you can do about it, usually no cure, and you just have to deal with it for the rest of your life.  Like your brain just said ""fuck this guy in particular"".",0,
"I think I recently realized why I get so upset after I finish consuming a piece of media, particularly with shows and books. I used to think it was a ""Oh no, it's over!"" kind of thing. But I recently realized that it's something more. I envy the characters in the stories. Not all of them, but a lot of them. I envy their relationships, their positive traits, their triumphs, etc. I keep obsessing over it and it's driving me crazy. I just wish I could be a part of their world.",0,
"Idk if this is because of depression but every time my parents or siblings are nice to me I feel very upset. I can't really describe or explain it but it's a mixture of extreme sadness and anger. It makes no sense to me. It happens mostly with my parents because they show the most affection to me and every time the hug, compliment or talk well of me to others I just get so upset. Sometimes when they hug me I even feel like crying. It's very strange. This doesn't happen with friends btw. ",0,
"I just need a little bit of courage. I could go and try to rearrange the dates, but I feel that if I give up now, I will kick myself back.",0,
"I wonder about this a lot. On one hand, depression is absolutely horrible and I often wish it away. On the other, would I be who I am today without it? I know that if I didn't have depression, my self identity would be entirely different. 

How does depression shape you to be who you are, and do you think it's for the better or worse? ",0,self identity will be different
"My mind has gone dark , I am going to go to my psychiatrist and tell her what I am feeling and how I see the world now. Maybe she can help because the medicine honestly isn't , fingers crossed because if not , I might just leave everything behind and run away somewhere.",0,
"I got all As and Bs this semester (and last year I passed with flying colors), I made it through Christmas, I haven't done anything dangerously reckless or intentionally hurt myself in years, but I still just constantly want to crawl into a hole and die. I have a constant knot in my throat that won't go away unless I'm drinking, high, or talking to one of the few people that I really trust, and I can't figure out any other way to get rid of it without taking drugs that make me feel like a husk of a human being. I hate this, I should be happy, I should be enjoying my winter break and not sitting in my bed at 3am complaining on the internet. I wish I had the confidence to ask the girl I've had a crush on for the past year out, or at least be self aware enough to be able to convince myself that she's just not interested. Fuck this. I hate feeling like shit all the time while my life is actually going alright and then feeling fine for months at a time even though everything is falling apart. Just let me enjoy not having a reason to be stressed out for once.",0,
"I'm cleaning my life up.

"Im shocked. I didnt realize how much I had lost. Im not thin by any means, but... Im not really that fat anymore. I think im one of the healthiest people in my family (though most of them are obese or suffer eating disorders). Ive gotten so used to my diet, but now I need to maintain what I have. Losing much more would affect me negatively... But it makes me sad that I still dont like my appearence.

I expected I would just suddenly find myself attractive if I hit the right weight, but I still dont. I dont know how to feel about it... I know I should be happy that Ive fulfilled something ive been working on for 3 years, but I still dont feel good enough. Hard to believe people when they say you look good when you cant even get a girlfriend, you know? Guess that counts as a rant. I dunno.",0,
"I recently remembered this very vivid moment from my childhood: I was probably 9 years old, and I distinctly remember feeling hopeless and wanting to kill my self. I was crying and screaming that nobody loved me and I wanted to die. A decade later and I'm laying in bed with cuts on my arm and thinking about every mistake I've ever made- wondering why I am the way that I am and praying to whatever may lie beyond the endless void that I don't wake up in the morning. ",0,
"I'm sorry.

My entire life, until recently, I thought depression was merely another word for being sad.  I had thought it was just a feeling that would quickly go away.  I had thought that depression was something that was not a big deal, that it was more of a joke than anything. Whether it be society telling me that it wasn't serious or if it was just me being nieve; I need you to know I'm sorry I held these beliefs. 

Until you experienced it, you can never really understand just how terrible and debilitating it is.  I read some of your stories and a peice of me breaks.  I can't even start to begin to comprehend how some of you must feel.  I don't want to downplay my own experience (because I now know depression, no matter the severity, is serious) but it seems so miniscule compared to some of your struggles.

I can't believe there was once a time where I would even ask my self, ""Why can't these people just be happy."". If only it was that easy.  I really wish it was.  From the bottom of my heart, I wish you the best in 2017.  Merry Christmas, happy holidays and make this year great.

I'm sorry.",0,
"You see, I work as a horticulturist, we deal with shrubs, weeds and other shorter plants. My job is so-so, but I hate the idea of working.

So how do I stay sane? Well, there are plenty of red ants from time to time, and those little rays of sunshine loves to attacking anything in their vicinity, even if that thing is there to tend to their home.

I've been bitten several times now, and it hurts quite a bit. So, these days I love repaying the favor, it'd be selfish if all I do is take without giving right?

I'll stomp on them, crush them with my gloved hands, and my personal favorite, after they manage to climb onto me and bite me... Is to smack them lightly, enough to cripple and disorient, then I pull them apart, limb from limb... All the while asking it, ""how does it feel to be the one getting hurt?""

Sometimes I leave them with two legs, because it's amusing.",0,
I tried committing suicide 5 days ago. I didn't though. I went to a doctor. I talked to someone. It was hard. I wanted to die. But I feel comfort and safe and I feel good. I feel peace and I don't know where it came from. I feel ok. I'm 17 and It felt good not being lonely. ,0,

Im scared of how my life will end up and i cant stop feeling. I screwed up my studies and now im not good at anything and my family shames me and idk what to do. Life is all f**ked up and idk what to do. ,0,
"Hi I think I may be got depression but today few times I have feel good. First, when I have something like flashback in class when I feel just like few months ago, when I like English lessons. Then when I have a nice conversation with friend (can person with depression even normally talk with ppl and have fun becouse of it?). I have something like a sad mood that come out of nowhere, which I feel most of time, always when I'm alone. I feel like this for few hours, always in the begining of a day and in the end. In middle sometimes I even feel ok. Can someone with depression feel like this?",0,
"Hello I'm having a particularly difficult time right now, i feel bad for asking because I know some people have it so much worse than me but I just really need some encouragement from another human being right now. Or someone to play video games with and just talk to. I've spent the last 3 days in bed doing nothing and I feel disgusting. I just want to talk to a person.",0,
"I am fucking depressed. I never thought that I would ever know what depression felt like back when I was happy. I never imagined that I would ever feel so sad all the fucking time, my days become a blurry mix of stress and worrying about the next day. 
When will I be able to look forward to something again? How do I begin to enjoy life like I did two years ago? I used to always wake up so happy to get ready for high school in junior year. I used to always look forward to the next whatever coming. Now I don't have that. I miss my old life. I don't enjoy having my own apartment, my own job, cats, and college like I thought I would. 

TL;DR To those who won the battle against depression, how??? And how long did that take???",0,
"Here it comes again, the depression season after awhile. I've been trying to be so strong for people I love. But I just can't shut my brain from overthinking all the time and it's eating my energy. Not even distractions work anymore and soon I just find myself laying and wishing I could sleep like a month. I don't know what to do with myself anymore, I think I will be a mess like this forever.",0,
"hey guys 
erm, I really just want to talk to someone right now. I think things aren't going that great for me atm. I don't really have anyone to talk to right now and I really want to have a conversation with someone

"Have been trying my best to be the best version of myself I can in order to show someone I really care about that I'm worth trying for. Now I've seen they couldn't give two shits about me and they're running around after God knows how many people.

I'm so messed up.",0,
"The thought only came to me after a dream i had last night.  I was John Constantine (a DC comics magician who has a history of screwing over demons) and I got caught by a demon.  I was put into a torture chamber for two years (knives cutting me, demons hitting slicing me, riding a bike to exhaustion and beyond, etc) and even though it hurt like hell, I knew I would get out, I knew that the story would go on and I would be able to get back on my feet.  Yet yesterday and today, in my waking life, I felt/feel significantly depressed with no such hope.

How is my dreaming brain ""me"" and also not ""me""?  How can I feel so frickin awful while I am awake but somehow, that part of my brain isn't accessed while I am dreaming?  Something tells me most psychiatrists and neurologists still don't know the answer, but I felt compelled to ask.",0,
"Every time you try to be happy, it's fleeting. Like the man trying to roll a boulder up a mountain and he never gets it to the top. You try to fill your ballon. Try to be happy. Than somebody with their needle pops it. I get tired of my balloons popping. Happiness is fleeting with bubbles popping. Wish I could make one ballon and protect but I know it will splatter from needles and pins. Had to get this off my chest.",0,
Hi for most of a day I feel bad but now i feel just...kinda empty. I think I was happy for some time but then I realized that I feel kinda...feared about something? Like I don't know if I'm happy or sad. Something between but not normal feelings. I enjoy reading (I doing this when I started feel like this) have smile on my face but it feels kinda wrong. Is it emptyness?,0,
"I'm stuck. At 18 years old I realize this empty feeling is all I know. I have no recollection of a childhood. No memory of a day before I just feel numb all of the time. To me a world outside of this mental state doesn't exist. It is misery; its also my comfort. I try to escape the grasp of my vices, everything and everyone that's made me this way. Every step I make on the up is just ten to plummet. There's no leaving my own sick head. That's why is easier to remain numb than to feel anything at all. 

 Sorry for the thought garbage and thanks for reading. ",0,
"My therapist tried to introduce a breathing method to reduce anxiety, which I am sure works. For real normal people. He was saying things like ""If you breathe when you are stressed you'll be able to feel happier and less afraid"" ""But I don't really think I feel any emotions other than fear..."" ""Well my job isn't to make you happy, it's to help you deal with your anxiety"". ""But I don't feel those emotions...that won't help me..."" Useless. They don't understand or care. 

Ignoring all of this, for the sake of argument lets ignore the fact that human life doesn't matter. Who are they to say we don't have the right to death? Why do they get to decide that? Why do they get to say that? 

I am not a human. I am a husk. A shell. Those methods will not help me. Therapy is just a waste of money, don't do it.",0,
"I find when I am at my lowest, the world seems incredibly hopeless and sad. I cannot smile, laugh, hope or dream. I do my best to get on with my life and not let the pain takeover. I get extra help when I need it, and medication is a great help. But some days it is just too much, and it becomes a real struggle to make it to the end of the day alive. I'm 24, no family and few friends. My world seems lonely and desolate at the best of times, and unbearable at the worst. It is wonderful people like yourselves who provide the light on my darkest days. My life has been saved countless times by the kindness of such people. You help me to give tomorrow another try. I will never be able to express my gratitude enough to those of you who take time out of your day to comfort me when I need it. The best I can do instead is to keep going, just another day. One day I hope I can provide the same comfort to someone as you all do to me. My name is Josh and thanks to you, I will still be here tomorrow. ",0,
"Long story short, always had severe depression and anxiety. While I'm in a better state of mind I'm trying to motivate myself to start hobbies for when I'm down.
Anything that's easy and almost a mindless task would be great.

"I think I am just going to grab a bottle of alcohol this weekend and fly out to my sisters house , I am tired, and done, I ve tried to speak up but no luck but I might get her attention this way....

"My depression has been getting so bad that I'm sluggish after even a few days of getting up, going to work, and doing what I need to do.

Over the course of the next few months, I'm working, going back to school, auditioning for a musical, organizing an event in a nearby city, and then there's my social life.

As you may notice, I organized a lot of these things when I was feeling ""up"". Now that I'm starting to come down, I don't know how to get myself back up. I used to do it so easily",0,
"New years days was so shitty, I came so close to slitting my wrists clean. But I stopped myself and thought it over before falling asleep. This morning I fell off my bike in the middle of the street on my way to the library, almost getting run over, and JUST after getting it repaired for a flat tire which cost me over 70 dollars! I'm so angry right now for having to spend that money which I was going to use for food for the week. I thought it was going to be no more than $35, but fuck it, they charged me double for the labor alone. I'm so mad right now I may just attempt taking my life again.",0,
Ive been feeling lonely lately and really depressed and i just want to talk to some people,0,
"I'm thinking about getting some help and Have a few questions on what to expect if I did. I'm also in the UK if that helps.

If I were to go and see a GP and they prescribed something, how much would they usually prescribe? Is it a large amount of medication? Does it state whether they are anti-depressants usually?

Also if i were prescribed medication would I be asked to attend a follow up appointment at some point? If so how often?",0,
"Today is another really low day for me. I can feel myself slipping away and becoming more depressed from each and every passing second, but I still have a feint voice in my mind that is saying, âYou should get up and do something, even just walk around.â I havenât had the will power to do anything; I barely care enough about getting up for work, but I am thankful that I currently wonât let myself starve or be homeless.

I was forcibly admitted to the hospital twice for attempted suicide (pills, and cutting respectively) and eventually got hooked up with a sliding scale office that had therapists in the West Seattle area that got me on a biweekly visit and eventually prescribed antidepressants. 

Over the past three years, I have moved multiple times, to different states, and recently moved back to Washington State. I had a counselor in West Seattle that got me the recommendation for antidepressants and they seemed to work for me; but after moving around (and losing most everything I owned in the process) I am thinking I need to get back to both therapy and medication; however, I donât remember her name or phone number. West Seattle is a long distance from where I currently live in Federal Way, but I donât know anywhere else to turn to.

Does anybody have an idea of how to find a sliding scale clinic in the area? When I google sliding scale clinics, I donât get many, if ANY, therapists, just dentists and pediatric doctors.

"Hello. I am at home again, I had my first surgery last week (painful appendix) and I am just hanging out at home another week. And honestly I am feeling lonely and depressed. I am feeling good health wise and I decided to heal as much as I can. And I am bored and all I been doing is watching movies and now I am watching How I Met Your Mother. I keep thinking about the accident I was involved in too. My truck is messed up on the left side and looks like the other persons insurance isn't going to pay the damage. I just can't believe my luck. My first accident and than my first surgery (unrelated to each other) occurred in the same week. So. I was like ok, well I was than reminded that I don't have many friends and my family is distant. I was just so involved with work and I don't really have anyone. Well I was talking to the surgeon and she said it best about all that was happening ""I am sorry, just bad luck"" And I kept thinking about that all week and its so true. Bad luck. I am know this sounds silly. I figure someone out there has problems and feelings far more severe than what I am writing. Anyways I thought of just writing my thoughts and feelings and seeing if anyone else can relate :)  ",0,
"I have a lot (self-diagnosed, albeit) signs that lead to the dreaded D word. Not sure if it's because of external influences, or some chemical imbalance. I only find relief in meditation and sleep. I'm afraid to read others posts from fear of empathizing and manifesting their feelings in my life and not getting a sincere gist of my own situation and feelings. Are there any tips someone could give to someone who seems manic and apathetic at the same time? Is there anyone I can talk to who may understand what it is I'm feeling? Are these feelings even real?

"After years of different therapies, tens of therapists, the usage of nearly all anti-depressants, support groups, pursuing hobbies and practicing mindfulness etc etc...

What if I am just not meant to get better? What if it is impossible? 

My reasoning for thinking this is that what if my brain, on an evolutionary level, was simply not made to cope with all this stuff? Of course many centuries ago it really was survival of the fittest. If you were weak (mentally or physically) - you died. Nowadays with all these therapies and medications, I feel as if it is messing with my brain as it doesn't know how to cope with everything that happens and the medications that affect it.

I know that brains have the ability to evolve and change its mind paths through neuroplasticity I just feel as if it is impossible in this case.

Can anyone relate to this as I am feeling really down about this whole thing.. Feels like I will be like all my life.",0,

Now my parents are going to have to remind me to do all that and it will embarrass me that I need to be babied as a teenager. I also have braces, so brushing and all that is already hard when I'm not down, so it's impossible when I am. This stinks.",0,
