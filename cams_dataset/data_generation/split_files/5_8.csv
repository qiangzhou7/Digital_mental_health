"Hello! I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a while now but more so anxiety. Depression was very random and I could usually find the trigger. 

However, for the past month I have felt HORRIBLE. I feel so disassociated with everyone and everything. Usually if I have a few drinks, I can easily socialize and have fun. But now, no matter what, I don't care what people are saying, not do I care to even engage in conversation. Even with close friends!

When I try to act ""normal"" it seems forced and I often go ""blank."" I feel like I have to force myself to laugh or seem happy in situations that would usually bring me joy. 

I feel like I almost induce it myself. Ever since this started about a month ago, I'm so scared I'm going to feel bad, that I start feeling bad. My brain always wins. If I let one negative thought creep in, my entire mood changes and I can't seem to change it back to positive like I used to be able to do. 

What is this feeling? Have you been able to overcome it? I used to have fun and be the life of the party. Now I can't even force it... it seems so unnatural.

Since this is the way it has been for my entire life, I have long ago accepted this and not really worried about it but I knew I was missing out on a lot, especially stuff like house parties, etc... But at this point I am pretty much over it and I would be happy enough if I ever had a girl, but that seems like an impossible task also.

"Hi. I haven't really posted on reddit before, but I really don't know any other place I can anonymously say this. 

I've had depression before, I've beat it. For a short period of about six months, I felt amazing. I didn't care about people who didn't matter, I didn't feel dark and empty inside, it didn't hurt to be alive. But something happened in the summer that has made me feel that way again. My suicidal thoughts have returned, and worse than ever. It was a time when I was the closest to actually killing myself.
I thought it was situational, that it would go away, but it didn't. It just came back and it stayed, and it manifested in a form much stronger than it was in before. 
What's worse, is that I really feel helpless now. I can't tell my family about this, they will only tell me bullshit like ""the power of you will can change this"" or whatever. I don't feel comfortable talking about this to my friends, hence me talking about it here anonymously, and my boyfriend tries to help me but I feel like nothing he is doing is helping, and it's not his fault, it's mine. And I'm afraid that if my brain stays in this stupid place, he will leave me, and my friends would leave me, as people have left me due to that before. I'm afraid I'll be alone again, more alone than I already am. And a lot of the times I feel like none of this is worth it. That I should just go ahead and end this life of pain already. 
I don't know where I was going with this or why I'm posting this... maybe it's just an act of desperation. Nothing in my head makes sense now.

Basically im a useless, lazy, attention seeking, selfish person who literally deserves nothing even though I get so much shit for free from my parents which just makes me feel bad cos they are wasting so much time and effort into a boring, nothing person. Nearly the whole of the time I am awake is just spent thinking about how I wasted everybody else's time just doing some stupid shit that they could have spent doing something to benefit them but instead they have to sit through my shit which doesn't help anybody at all. I also started cutting my self about a week ago, nobody knows yet and I have no idea why I'm doing it when I think about it I realise I'm just cutting for fucking attention again which just makes me feel like a shitty person. My whole life is paradox, pointless and goes on for ever all I can think about is how much of an attention seeker I am which makes me depressed then I think that I'm just putting on this sadness for attention which makes me think that I'm an attention seeker again and the only way to break thing fucking endless cycle is to fucking die. Every so often I go out to walk my parents dog and because of where we live I have to walk along this busy road with the traffic coming up behind me and every single time I hear a car part of me just hopes one will just smash into me, ending it all. I'm too much of a pussy to commit suicide on purpose and that will be selfish to everyone I know anyway so I wish there was just a way to just disappear as if I had never even been alive in the first place. Another thing is that I literally have 0 hope for the future, I'm 15 now and going through my GCSEs, but my grades aren't even a problem all my expected grades are above average and fine but every single other thing that is just a complete failure I have no idea how to get a job I have no idea how fucking do anything at home except for sit on my ass and play fucking videogames I have no idea how to be sociable and make friends I have never had a fucking girlfriend and I just realised I contradicted myself with the selfishness and the girlfriend wasting time and now I'm thinking in that same fucking paradox and my life is just turning to shit. Its as if I'm being pushed closer and closer to my inevitable death and it started slow at first but I'm being pushed faster and faster towards it in the past month. Idc if nobody reads this I just have to get this off my chest which I have no idea why this shitty rant would help with anything and fuck I'm just gunna post it.

"For the life of me, I canât figure out what is keeping me from eating a fistful of pills so I can continue to do the only thing I actually want to do, sleep. I have no one. Even that backup friend I never really liked in the first place, gone. Iâm not sure how it happened. It was like one day everyone turned on me. Each situation and bridge burned is more baffling than the next. I feel like the universe is fucking with me.

For example: Last night my landlord and his wife called me together, bc I didnât pay my rent. In California we donât have to pay rent until the following day if it falls on a bank holiday. When I tried to politely explain that a bank holiday meant I cOuld not go inside a bank, I received a twenty minute lecture from them both, (because everyone talks to me like Iâm an incompetent female), about how everyone has to pay rent. 
This resulted in my driving around to various stores to get âcash backâ following a transaction bc due to daily atm withdrawal limits being$400 and the bank being closed, I had no other way to access the money in my account. So even though I went out of my way to do that series of inconvenient errands, my landlord was still had this to say: 

âI have to say this is not how it should be and I will refrain from saying more.
So, it is very late.â

To which I replied : 

âI agree so Iâll refrain as well because this is also incredibly inconvenient for me. Thatâs why there is a law for this.â

From this followed an incredibly uncomfortable in person exchange of cash. Now this where the baffling part comes in. This is what every day of my life had been like for the last six months. Itâs one giant shit on Natasha fest where this dumb incompetent girl canât possible be right. ...

As soon as I arrive home from the exchange of cash, I receive a very agitated phone call from my landlord and his wife saying that I did not hand them the correct amount of money. Lucky for me, I had some downtime in the car before the handoff, so I had counted it so many times I remembered that there were 38 twenties 4 tens and one hundred dollar bill. So in the middle of the screaming I try to interject that maybe they could tell me what bills were there so I could see if maybe one dropped in my car. As Iâm asking reportedly for him to count the number of twenties, over the screams of his wife saying not to count it again because they did and itâs not there, he finally begins to count and shockingly, all the twenties are there. Then shit gets real weird. I start having to argue basic math. Iâm on the phone and Iâm speechless bc as most people with a calculator or third grade math know, 20 X 38 = 760. So Iâm fucked. I am speechless. If they arenât going to believe math, something essentially black and white, i might as well start speaking a different language bc nothing I say matters. 

Eventually I could hear the husband starting to realize that maybe the cash did add up correctly so I gave them an out by saying maybe they wanted to call me back in a few minutes. Later I received a text saying, 
âItâs all here. Goodnight.â
No apology. 
And so is my trash heap of a life. Empty. No human relationships. No money. No passion. No desire to get out of bed. And frustrated to tears. 

I hate crying. I spend everyday frustrated to tears.

I wish I was dead.

Anyways. This is my first post to an Internet forum. I wonder if anyone actually reads this through to this part. I know I would have skimmed and skipped a long time ago. Jesus even I bore myself.
