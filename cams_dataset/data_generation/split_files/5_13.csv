"*There is so much great feedback on Reddit and I'm really hoping to benefit from it please. The following is my stack and some background information.*



I saw an Adult ADHD Specialist last month and he said while I've been treated primarily for *ADHD-PI* (diagnosed by Psychologist and follow ups with Psychiatrists) it is NOT the root cause of my *depression* and *anxiety.* My ADHD-PI and Anxiety are result from my depression ...mind blown ...I've been running the wrong way for 10yrs now?!



Disappointed as I really wasn't expecting this; I wrestled with it for a bit but then finally accepted it and am moving fwd. My doctor read the report and added 25mg of Aventyl to my bedtime stack. A couple weeks later my family was worried as I was severely depressed and upset for many reasons. I saw another doctor and he doubled the 25mg of Aventyl to 50mg and introduced Siv-Escitalopram (10mg) to be taken in my morning stack. 

    

I'm a little worried as he and the pharmacists warned me about **[Serotonin Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome)**. I also have been told/read that if you mess with your brain chemistry too much it could wake up a dormant bipolar disorder in you, that is if bipolar disorder is in your family history - and it is.

    

I don't drink often (1-2 drinks a week), eat 3 balanced meals (eggs and asparagus, bulletproof coffee, protein and veggies, aim for low sugar), and jog every other day.

    

Here is my present day stack I need advice on please:

    

AM (w/food): 

* Siv-Escitalopram (10mg)

* Vyvanse (50mg)

* Wellbutrin (300mg)

"For years, I have battled depression. I have battled suicidal ideations. I thought to myself, hospitalization and IOP would do the trick. Would get me out of this state. However, I realized a few days ago, maybe a week, that IOP doesn't give a shit about me. They just care about my insurance copay.

I am tired. I realized that I will never get better. My life is shit. I don't care about my job, I am barely hanging on to my life in general. I am losing friends by the minute. Why the fuck does my life even matter?

I just wish I had a gun, a rope, something, to end this misery. That's what I am right now, miserable. Not just now, for the past week, I have been miserable. But, the fact of the matter is, I don't want to get better anymore. The only way people know how treat me is to hospitalize me or IOP me or PHP me etc... These solutions clearly don't solve the problem.

Maybe this is my farewell note to the world, I don't know. I just need an exit strategy that limits the fallout. I don't want to shoot myself because that's too nuclear. I wish there was a full proof way of OD'ing. That way my family (the last vestige of people who care) would be able to see me at peace.

"So, I'm medicated but not in therapy, and this is more a collection of thoughts than a coherent chain, but it's something I've been thinking about often of late.  Anyway, here we go.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to be neurotypical.  It sucks there's no cure for depression, you know?  And that NT people have no fucking frame of reference talking about depression, like I have no frame of reference talking to someone with bipolar, which brings me to my next point.

&amp;nbsp;

Depression isn't ""really sad,"" you can't even fucking be sad when you're depressed.  You can't enjoy the things you used to enjoy.  For me, depression has always been this suffocating apathy, and ""feeling"" isn't an option.  I'm not crying because I'm sad, I'm crying because I'm feeling nothing, and it feels pointless.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to be a whole person.  I'm not motivated.  There's nothing I really want from life.

""I took the medicine, but the pills don't work, the pills they don't do anything, but rearrange all the littlest things.""  This is  a lyric by the band Streetlight Manifesto.

"We are all constantly searching for happiness in life and this is nothing more then the love emotion.

Why is it so important and powerful though?

The love emotion gives us so much in our lives that most are not aware of.

It is the ultimate emotion that gives us energy, motivation, happiness, intellect and clarity, health, makes us feel whole and contempt, increases our intuition that will give us the right questions to ask, give us the answers we need and ultimately push us towards our true personal purpose.

Did you realize it did all of this for us??

We constantly need to refill this love energy in ourselves without even knowing it. Most of us do it through the wrong ways that will have it fluctuating up and down causing an imbalance within ourselves.
We can do this from manipulating others of their energy, using substances, watching TV, using our cellphones, spending money, and the list goes on.

It does not have to be this way though and is not the best route. We can constantly have the love emotion in us and can do it in a beautiful way with ourselves without it fluctuating.

How can we hold the love emotion naturally?

We can receive and hold this beautiful emotion in us through the beauty of the natural world.
Through nature, the environment, animals, real food, ourselves, and even people if we do it the correct way. The energy is abundant and unlimited so it is not needed to manipulate others for it or do it in the non-beneficial ways.

Allow yourself to embrace the beauty of the natural world and have the love fill yourself completely.

Let go of your ego as it will just try to survive and destroy love.
Where love lives, ego cannot survive. It's only goal is to bring you down through selfish means and scare you into thinking love is not the answer.

Love is truly magical when you allow it to completely engulf yourself.

When you apply it correctly you can have all the benefits mentioned above. You will magnify in life and have an aura that will attract all the most beautiful things you ever wanted in you're life.",5,"manipulating others of their energy, using substances, watching TV, using our cellphones, spending money, and the list goes on."

"So I posted this on facebook to share with the handful of friends I know that are also suffering from mental illness. Unfortunately it was met with a wave of ""GET HELP"" messages that were not warranted or asked for. 

So I'm going to share it here with you folks and hope that it helps at least one person.

_____________________________________________________

I want to share something with all of my friends that are suffering from depression, anxiety or other mental illness. It's something I've been trying to do since I moved and I'm making it my official new years resolution. I won't promise it will work for you. We're all different, but it has helped me.

Every day pick one productive thing to get done. Just ONE. Even if it's something insignificant. Especially on the days you just want to stay in bed and wish for death and you can't find any motivation to do anything else.

Even something as simple as washing your hair. Wash that one pan you've been letting 'soak' in the sink for the last three days. Do one load of laundry and actually fold it and put it away. Sweep your kitchen floor. Vacuum your living room. Wipe your kitchen counters. Just one thing, even if it only takes 5 minutes.

Sometimes you may even find that overcoming that initial inertia gives you enough energy and motivation to do more. Maybe you clean the whole kitchen instead of just doing that one dish. But don't worry if it doesn't. As long as you do the one thing.

Just doing one productive thing each day can make you hate yourself a little less and feel a little less worthless.  And maybe when you come home from work and walk into a slightly cleaner kitchen you'll have a little feeling of satisfaction that is often elusive to those of us suffering with mental illness.

It's not a cure or anything. It might not even work for you. I don't know. I just wanted to share something that has helped me a little. Maybe it can help you too.

_____________________________________________________

That's what I posted on facebook but I want to lay down some rules for this exercise. 

1. **Don't** make a 'to do' list. Writing down everything you need / want to get done and having a big list to look at can be incredibly overwhelming and may cause you to recede further into your illness and retreat. We don't want that. Pick the one thing you want to get done either the night before or that morning and just do it. 

2. Your basic responsibilities such as going to work and feeding your children / pets does not count. Most of us have already learned to go through the motions of doing these things without reaching out of our comfort zone. Pick something you would normally procrastinate on or not do at all. 

3. Do it every day no matter what. No matter how shitty you feel or how badly you want to stay in bed. Staying in bed and doing nothing only feeds into our sense of worthlessness and self hatred. Get your ass up and at least do the one thing, even if you go right back to bed afterwards. If you are having an extraordinarily bad day pick the easiest thing you can possibly think of to get done and do it. Even if it only takes 30 seconds.

4. Allow yourself forgiveness if you don't complete your task to the extent that you originally wanted to. Beating yourself up is counter productive to the point of the exercise. Quoted from one of our members that suggested this rule.
&gt;I've been doing this and it does help. I am also more forgiving of myself. If I did have something I wanted to do, but didn't get it done I tell myself: it's okay, at least you got x,y,z done, and next time you should try to do x,y,z better. Really really really helps. 

_____________________________________________________

Please feel free to share / discuss any other rules for this exercise that should be added.

And of course PLEASE share with us how / if it's working for you. Tell us the things you accomplished today and in the future. 

For me today I cleaned my critter cages and took one of them that is no longer in use out to my garage and vacuumed the room I keep them in.

___________________________________________________

TL:DR (though I urge you to read at least the basic rules of the exercise) Do one productive thing a day no matter what. It might help you feel a little less worthless and demotivated. ",5,ductive thing each day can make you hate yourself a little less and feel a little less worthless

That choice reminds me that I can make a difference, whether that death be me or someone else. I would *never* do something like that, the thought does scare me.

"When daydreaming my mind brings up negative memories. In any situation, in any location my mind will simply wander and bring up pessimistic memories instantly. I'll often be left pondering ""why did I do that?"" - ""why did I say that?"". These will often be memories or sort of quick snapshots of uneasy moments in my life that will flash through my psyche as soon as I have a spare moment.

It's happened on the train, when at work and socialising with friends. The odd thing is that the memories vary in date - it could be something I said last week, to something I did at a party when I was like five years old. The underlying factor is that all of these memories will have negative associations and will leave me questioning my actions, thoughts and responses at the time. It seems as though I have no control over what memories or images appear - I have been overheard saying ""How can I even remember that!"" when peculiar or seemingly distant images re-appear.

Does anyone else have any similar experiences with this? And apologies if this is not the correct Reddit for this post.

"Long post coming ft. an overreaction of the year. Just had to vent this somewhere, wasn't going away.

So I just rece a message from someone. I had asked them to play, and they replied back with ''no hi or hello?''. It's just another one of the things I forget. Basic social rules like saying hi. Maybe it's the case that I've always been a cold and clumsy person, but I was forgiven for it when younger because of still being outgoing and trying to be positive around others. Now I can barely tell what I do wrong anymore, it just seems to be everything in so many parts of life. I'm an idiot. I've tried to be more caring but still feel so disconnected and unappreciated by others. It's not like being appreciated is what I'm entitled to. It's the contrary, and on the bright side maybe that could have its benefits too. You won't get any unwanted attention if you don't want to, you can just keep to yourself and people will respect that.

What makes me feel worse is that despite trying to connect others, I can't seem to. There's always that doubting and fear that I'm doing something wrong. Accidentally offending someone, not asking interesting enough questions, sounding lazy. Even if I change to seem more positive or confident (though no one has even pointed out that I seem negative!) it doesn't seem to make any difference. People react weirdly to me anyways. I feel like I can't even have small talk without it being noticed how awkward I am, how no one really gives a fuck, how my mind is blank and I have nothing fun to talk about. I feel like I've been contaminated and can't do anything right despite my best efforts. Almost never share negative feelings  with people either, so that's not the issue despite what this pity post might let someone think. 

Are some people just fundamentally unlikeable? Anyone else relate to this? ",5,"There's always that doubting and fear that I'm doing something wrong, Accidentally offending someone"
"Whatsup...

I'm 22. I haven't been *depressed* For my entire life... I can think of times when I have been extremely happily (mainly middle school), and very functional despite having mild depression, such as in highschool (prior state ranked athlete), but I was wondering if people with major depression (such as myself) or bipolar disorder, or even other mental illnesses are living in a constant genetic predisposition to depression, in which (when they're off medication), their mind/thoughts/senses are always in a strings length of a depressive episode.

For instance, picture an Instagram filter than is dark and bleak. I have always been a dark/unlively person and I learned to find bliss and stress reduction in my seemingly cloudy lifestyle/outlook. My ""happy"" emotions are mainly nostalgia and excitement. Like i said, i have been happy at certain points in my life, but i still always have that ""filter""... And sometimes I take solace in it.

But, is it safe to say that people without a genetic predisposition to depression's brains function (from birth) as a depressed person would function while on medication?",5,"My ""happy"" emotions are mainly nostalgia, always have that ""filter"

"I usually didnt care anymore about how I look but I just had a breakdown because i am just ugly. And it's not one of those situations where I'm just saying, no, I'm genuinely ugly. People have called me ugly. I know what I see in the mirror and in photos. I am the farthest thing from physically (or socially) appealing and now I'm suicidal because I can't hang out with anyone anymore without wanting to die. I feel so embarrassed just by being present anywhere because of how hideous and cringy I am. I hate myself. There's no one I'm more disgusted at than myself. I look like a monster.",5,"how hideous and cringy I am, I hate myself, There's no one I'm more disgusted at than myself,I look like a monster"
"I am going to keep living

Tired of a lot of shit but fuck 'em, plenty of good in this world too.
Nobody who tries to bully me in school, no asshole teacher, or anything else is going to fuck with me, it's my life not their's.
The coach who expects me to just push harder and work through my Asthma won't. People who roast me won't. People who steal my shit won't. The bullshit standards and weight of people enforcing them won't. I went through some emotional shit before, I have fucked up before, but I won't act like this crap defines me or my worth as a human. This life is worth more than a grade, a social circle, my struggle to run with asthma. Not going to act like it's all better, stuff is hard sometimes, but this world is about finding your own way. This life won't last forever, why suffer and let people attack your happiness each day. I hope those of you who have felt the same find the feeling some day. Have a good day everyone. :D",5,"went through some emotional shit before, I have fucked up before, but I won't act like this crap defines me or my worth as a human,life won't last forever, why suffer and let people attack your happiness each day"
"So I got a new therapist and she's good but I've only seen her 3 times, and I haven't seen her for a few weeks now. I'm a minor so I'm afraid she's going to fear for my safety and tell my parents, because I never want to 100% say I'm not gonna harm myself because I'm not a liar and I can never be sure.. if that makes sense. So dont know what to do, especially sense I don't really want to continue therapy, so it'll probably be our last session anyways. I just don't know what to do:(",5,"just don't know what to do, I'm a minor so I'm afraid she's going to fear for my safety and tell my parents,"
"Like I always self destruct and wanna fuck my life up. I'll blow up, fuck everything up and then once the smoke clears everything is fine. Then after a while I think I'm fine, like everything is cool no big deal. Nah bam I blow up again and fuck my life up.

I don't do well with accountability for myself. Like when I work with a team or have to lead a team it gives me purpose. Without purpose it's just a matter of time when I fuck things up.

In high school I took a blind shot hit and thought I was paralyzed when it was just a stinger. I wish that kid would've killed me.",5, don't do well with accountability for myself
"I have been isolated for most of my life. Every possible action I could take to improve my life has been rendered meaningless by previous attempts at averting the disaster that will be my future.

I feel like I am doomed forever and that nobody will love me. It's too late.

I am way too far behind to catch up with the normal crowd.

I have zero friends and literally no family to turn to in times of desperate need.

I have tried talking to doctors and therapists and that never worked either.

Whenever I bring up my problems, they say I am ""indulging in self pity"" or they treat me like I am blaming other people for my misery.

What am I supposed to do when my whole life has sucked and on top of that, my depression is getting worse?

It hurts whenever people try to take the situation and blame it on me, when they don't know me. Fuck them.

I don't know the point of this post. 
But, one thing I am certain about is that I am ready to die. I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know how to turn around my life. 

I don't know how to find love and I doubt anyone will love me (and if you are going to tell me it's too early to kill myself, then let me tell you that for most people, it comes naturally without any hard work whatsoever.
I, however, am miserable because I am a fuck up. An aberration. An anomaly).

Thank you for reading this garbage and good night.",5,"been isolated for most of my life,am doomed forever and that nobody will love me, It's too late"
"Iâm the last guy people would expect. I was really well liked and social in high school, good family, pretty decent money. But right now my depression is so bad I can barely muster the effort to even write this post. I just donât know what to do. I really want to die. I should be a freshmen in college, I had gone to UMD for a month and the depression got so bad that after a month I had to drop. I couldnât go to classes, I felt alone, the girl I really loved was ignoring me, and I felt like I was living an entirely new life. I come home and itâs just gotten worse, everything is hard. Everyone is doing more things than me. My friends never invite me with them, Iâve started smoking weed daily and Iâve put on more weight (I used to be too skinny). I can barely shower or put on socks in the morning, how can I work? I didnât even go in on New Yearâs Day out of emotional pain and now I have to work tomorrow morning and Iâm sitting here terrified of what will happen. I want to end up dead without the pain, or the heartbreak it leaves behind but Iâm just too scared of making a mistake or what comes after. Everyday hurts. I canât go on much longer, money is so tight and everyday just something new goes onto my plate. Iâve tried a million medications with no luck, Iâve attempted multiple therapists and ADT programs, nothing. I canât work but I have to. I havenât waken up before 4 pm in a week. It hurts. Everything hurts. ",5,"too much pain, worry, and doubt in my life"
"I have been dealing with depression for a while, however in the past couple of years it's really been bad. It's mostly due to physical issues and nlt being anywhere in life at my age.

I used to think that I was just lazy, but I'm not however I've totally changed due to depression. Here's some examples

-My phone is my life. I don't use my computer because ny phone allows me to stay in bed all the time comfortably.

-my favorite hobby now is to mindlessly browse around YouTube

-I don't like interaction with others. I prefer to stay on my phone on reddit

-my job is shit but I'm too comfortable here

-I don't study until the very last minute

-I don't watch sports anymore as I'd rather be online

-I can't even clean or organize my room and laundry",5,don't like interaction with others. I prefer to stay on my phone
