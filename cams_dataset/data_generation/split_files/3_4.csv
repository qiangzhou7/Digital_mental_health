"Tried tons of SSRI's and Tri-cyclics in my previous bouts of MDD.  Last bout of MDD (2002) pristiq + Wellbutrin kicked it's ass.

This bout pristiq + Wellbutrin didn't work.

We've rotated a bunch of adjuncts in and out with pristiq.

Currently taking pristiq + lamotreigene + latuda.  Been on this regimen for 3months.  That plus a round of TMS and Talk therapy with a psychologist has not broken this round of MDD.

I'm definitely changing regimens, have an appointment with psychologist tomorrow morning.  What am I going to change to...

I'm thinking it's time to change to something completely different - an MAOI.  Thoughts?  Anyone been down this road?

Other major symptoms of my depression:  Lack of energy, trouble sleeping (taking temazepam for this problem), lack of enjoyment...

Do the newer reversible MAOI's have the same dietary restrictions?",3,Tried tons of SSRI's and Tri-cyclics in my previous bouts of MDD.  Last bout of MDD (2002) pristiq + Wellbutrin 
"I had a good run, there was positivity. But unfortunately, the negatives became too much. Succumbed to alcohol, failing college and getting kicked out my dorm.

I don't know where else to go, truthfully. I feel like such a massive waste of space. Wasted my parents money on this dorm. Wasted their money on school. I've just hit a lower point than ever before. 

I don't have high hopes anymore. I just wake up and go through the motions. Every day is just another day I got to get through. I don't really know what to expect, from anything. ",3,"Succumbed to alcohol, failing college and getting kicked out my dorm"
"Hey everyone. First time poster. I've had depression for about 11 years now. I wanted to know if any of you with chronic depression have also experienced this... Now that I am a bit older and have had the illness for so long, I'm kinda more just okay with it? Like I used to get more triggered and depressed simply because I was self-aware that I had an illness, but now that's gone. Is this just another symptom of apathy? Or is it possible to live my life comfortable and aware that I have a mental health problem?

"New Year's Day. What a way to start the year, right? I've spent the last few weeks, maybe months feeling worthless and sad and wanting to die but not wanting to kill myself, so I fantasized about getting into an accident and dying in a way that looked like it wasn't on my own hands. I got out of the car with just some whiplash and some bruises but I'm fine otherwise.

It's a miracle I'm alive right now. I spun out on the freeway going 75 mph. I got hit by another car. The witnesses and patrol officer and the EMT all expected me to be unconscious or way more badly hurt than I was. I don't believe in God, but I do think there was a greater force at work, telling me to stop fantasizing about something so horrible and to get my shit together.

So I'm going to. Phone calls give me anxiety, I know I'm going to have a bout of PTSD related to driving, I'm going to feel guilty about wrecking my parents' car, but I'm okay. Everything is okay. Sometimes a wake up call like this is what you need to get better mentally.",3,"going to have a bout of PTSD related to driving,  feel guilty about wrecking my parents' car"
"I have MS and I have done everything to pull myself together and build a life. It went ok for half a year but then it started. I was VERY motivated for university, I started my first year of physics major in October and made very healthy habits(eating healthy, sports, morning routines, reading every day, planning the day and week, working deeply without distractions, etc.) and it went pretty good. I didn't expect everything to go perfect, far from it, but I did expect to have some control. But then we had to talk about medicine. My parents are superstitious and I am a sceptic; I think critically and I analyse everything to truly understand the situation. My parents wanted to start alternative medicine and I am fine with that for as long as it is not dangerous as I wish to let my parents be at some ease. They found about this Vitamin D3 treatment which can be VERY VERY dangerous(my kidneys can fail any day) and we had soooo mannyy FIGHTS over it, it was chatastrophic. My mum started to hurt me bad with her shit and dad was just ignorant and arrogant. Moreover, the medicine for MS is VERY DANGEROUS as well, a girl of my age got diabetes and Thyroid Disease so she had to even drop out of fucking musical academy which was her dream just because of MEDICINE. We had countless talks and fights and shit ever since my uni has started and everything has gone to SHIT. All my habits are gone, all my plans are ruined and I probably even have depression now.

You see, when I got the MS diagnosis I spent A WEEK having an existential crisis and I really decided I wanted to be a physicists no matter what, as I felt like that is part of my identity, to truly become a master in something. I have decided to be a physicists roughly a year before that, however now that decision became a huge part of my life. But every time we fought at home I couldn't work for days no matter what; I tried to push and concentrate and I even started going to library to study but after a month even that wouldn't help anymore. I have very good friends, but they are of little to no help and I LOVE my parents, but they try way TOO DAMN HARDDDDDDDD, they are beating my mental health down every day. 

For example: yesterday I was feeling very depressed even though I felt motivated the day before, it just came out of the blue, so I was super slow and lazy and it was impossible to get out of bed. My parents saw that and started worrying, the first thing they said is that I need to snap out of it and that im just pretending because I am lazy, do you know how much that hurt????!!!! But I am rational and I was somehow able to keep my anger and sadness and pool of emotions down to explain them FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME what is going on with me and why is it so but they just wouldn't understand! This time they threatened me throwing me out and you know what, I fucking agreed because I was so desperate that I literally thought that there is no other way. I was SO TIRED that I thought this was my destinity, that im such a pure piece of fucking shit that even my parents want to get rid of me. I just wanted to go and just live my life. I even started planning on how to get a job and shit, it was PURE TORTURE. I have cooled down since then, but now I have not worked for school yet again and I am even more behind, yet fucking again, will it ever end? Why am I even trying with bloody physics which is HARD when I know I have such a terrible condition. I magically passed almost all the midterms and everyone was happy that I did and they kept saying I am amazing and shit, I was so angry because NO ONE understood how much I am suffering because I am not able to learn 10% of what I should be learning, its like being a kid in front of a toy store looking through glass at a toy you wanna sooo desperately have but you KNOW you will never have it. I even tried to talk to a psychologist and it helped the first day and I was so happy that I finally had some real help, but then she said she would call me next week for next talk from the meeting but she never called and it has been a month since then now and I dont even know her name nor can I contact her, she is a psychologist at the hospital! I feel so dead, I don't knwo what to do. Every singe day I fight myself, I fight to gather some energy and motivation to do the work and have fun, but every week is ruined by fighting with parents and now almost every day is ruined by just being empty, dead without energy and tired and with hate for myself and shit. 

I feel lonely, not understood, desperate, without any energy(cannot even have fun, im forcing myself to have fun more than actually having it), im scared all the time, i feel like people just wanna quickly be done with me cuz im a burden, i have insomnia, i sleep too long, sometimes i cant eat at all while on other times i binge eat like crazy and i find myself looking for food every 2 minutes, im scared of studying, im scared of talking to anyone but a professional cuz they wont understand, Im overthinking all the time, i cannot concentrate anymore at all(e.g. got a huge burst of motivation cuz of a fight few days ago and started to work on math but it lasted 15 minutes and then i felt HUGE resistance and my mind went batshit crazy). The only thing missing is the thought of kling myself, but i doubt it will ever cross my mind for more than 5 seconds, as I am rational enough AND I know very well that life is beautiful and valuable. I just CANNOT find a way out of my situation, im caught in this room with walls closing in on myself, but there has to be a way out, but im close to breaking, right now I spend 90% of the time being depressed and then I have these rational outbursts that are seemingly the product of my past self and they seem to protect me and that is why I am here and not dead yet. My healtjh is getting much worse though and MS is getring worse too, ive gotten a new attack a few months ago and it is still active, I cant feel my feet normal anymore, i feel much less and the feeling is weird and its driving me fucking crazy, tho i have gotten a bit used to it. Now I do t even know how I feel about my parents, i fucking love them, but at the same time i hate them for driving me crazy, but i dont blame them, but i still do, but I really really do not know how to feel about them. For new year they were all kind and shit but i cannot take this kindness seriously anymore. I know they mean it but i cannot smile normally i cannot be happy. But i still want to be on good terms with them. What a shitty family we are.

I posted this here to gather some feedback information, new ideas, or new information to help myself because I do not want to give up, ever, for I still believe I can become a physicist, even if it sounds fucking stupid. If there is ONE FUCKING THING that I want to do in my entire life is to research physics and solve math problems. As you can see, I still have MS to deal with, so even if I somehow deal with depression, I will still have this monster over my head which could strike me down any time. For example, how will i deal with a family, I cannot imagine putting such a massive burden on someone I would love, will I ever even have a wife and kids?(I hugely respect what Hawking did and I think it was the right thing to do)

"This is my first time posting here. I have been mentally going downhill for a few years now. About 3 years ago my dad got sick with cancer and went through all the treatments, radiation, surgeries, chemotherapy and eventually when all else failed, immunotherapy. He ended up in the ICU on a ventilator for a few weeks until he ultimately passed away. This whole experience broke me. He was my person. My mom and I aren't very close. I have no other close family members. I definitely felt myself slipping once he got sick and then watching him get worse and worse. He died in April and I've been functioning but I feel fucking terrible most days. I wake up feeling so shitty, like complete despair. I feel like this planet and most of the people on it suck to be frank. I never had a clear cut direction or passions to follow so I find myself thinking about my purpose a lot. I do wish I could end my life some days but I know I never will. 

I go to therapy. I have tried some medications but honestly I haven't found anything that works. I don't enjoy anything really so I don't have hobbies. I do have a fiance. He is a saint. He's my only real support. He's been getting me through.
I just need to know of anyone who has been this bad and came back. What meds have worked for you, what have you done to get yourself out of this?

I had a difficult childhood too and therapy has brought up a ton of emotional baggage that's contributing to my mental state.",3,"dad got sick with cancer and went through all the treatments, radiation, surgeries, My mom and I aren't very close, I have no other close family members,definitely felt myself slipping once he got sick and then watching him get worse and worse"
"So I'm 23, I've survived two rare cancers that have badly affected my education in high school and university. I graduated university with a bachelor degree in business but my GPA is horrible, as my physical and mental health during my studies was terrible. My grades improved over time but the damage was done. I'm now looking for my first full-time job (I have a year of part-time work experience) and have had no luck since graduating in August of 2017. 

Its gotten so bad that I constantly doubt myself, I feel that I am stupid and really have no future prospects in terms of career. I constantly use various tools to try to justify to myself that I'm not a failure (such as IQ/Psychological Tests), but they really don't mean anything. I feel that I have to justify myself for things outside that were out of my control and obviously, people in the real world don't care and will more than often see me as a liability.
On top of this, due to my treatment of my second cancer, my left arm lacks fine motor skills. I'm already handicapped in the competitive job market and why would any employer hire me over some other graduate with better marks and is physically capable. 

My personal confidence is at an all-time low as well, being a 5'4ft balding 23-year-old doesn't help me fit in and frankly, with my understanding of how nature works, I am screwed. I am working on improving my overall physical fitness and am I by no means anti-social but I feel that I can't relate to any of my peers.

No one helped me during my life (outside of my family) and I have no idea what I want to do, I'm not passionate about helping others or any career objectivities or anything at all. I just want to work and be productive so that I can reach a point where I don't have to be. 

I think that I am an intelligent, moral person that can actually bring some value to whatever I do but no one is going to give me chance, because why would they? I don't want to end up on welfare and I want a successful career, I don't want to be rich or famous, I just want a purpose. Sure, it's my fault, I could of done better and now just like most of my life, I have to learn the hard way.   

What do I do? Do I go back and study something else to gain a better GPA (and more student debt)? I don't really have many options. Even if I go study something in demand, like engineering or IT, who is going to hire someone in a hands-on profession who can't fully use both hands?

"Hello r/depression,

Recently I have finally made sure that my tolerance to all kinds of psychiatric medicines is higher than average. That is, I have to take doses higher than average / recommendation to achieve the same level of therapeutic effects. Personally I like the effects of the medicine combination of sertraline (Zoloft) and bupropion XL (Wellbutrin XL), but I have progressively felt the need to increase the dose.

Have / had anyone ever been on sertraline (Zoloft) 300mg or more? Did it work better for you? Did any adverse effect happen?

Have / had anyone ever been on bupropion XL (Wellbutrin XL) 450mg or more? Did it work better for you? Did any adverse effect happen? (I have known that this medicine can increase seizure risk when in high dose.)",3, been on sertraline (Zoloft) 300mg or more

"I really don't know where to start, I've never been someone to shy away from sharing my feelings, but for some reason sharing my feelings with people irl right now just doesn't seem to help any more, so I'm hoping for some kind of release or anything by sharing how I feel on this sub.. I just wanna preface by saying that I'm going to talk about 3 different girls in my life, 2 of which are integral to this, (A and B), however I want to say I'm not depressed because of girls, I wouldn't be posting here if it was just about heartbreak (not that there is anything wrong with that, I just don't want people to get that imoression from this)

I've suffered from depression off/on since I was about 15, so it's been 8 almost 9 years. By off/on I mean it has hills and valleys, it's always kind of there, but at the same time kind of can go away? I don't know if that makes much sense.. right now, and definitely for the past 6 months, it's the longest time I've ever spent at the bottom of a valley, and it also happens to be one of the deepest I've ever been down. 

I'm definitely an ugly duckling story. A lot of my depression started originally as an awkward teen, I had long emo hair, I was very skinny and always have been, I was shy, had very bad social anxiety to the point I would vomit all the time, even when at school and going out with friends. I never liked the town I grew up in, people knew me to be a certain way or thing, that when I tried to change it just didn't work.. 

Fast forward from when I was 15 and when I finally moved out and went to college, at 18, I had truly 'blossomed'. I looked good. And for my 4 years at college I slayed. I've been with over 100 women, spent my nights going out partying, spending all my time with friends.. everything went away, my anxiety, my depression and my awkwardness. 

During that time however, I experienced an emotionally abusive relationship with girl A (protecting names).. this was in the early days, and she amplified all my problems tenfold (until I finally escaped and my mental health improved).

I met the girl of my dreams (at the time) when I was 20, and things were great until it ended, which sent me in to a spiral of sleeping with so many women to block out my feelings, I drank a shit tonne, I even did drugs (I'm not proud of it, and it was completely against character, I regret it deeply, but I'm just glad I wasn't hurt nor did I hurt anyone else during that time). This continued for a few months, and I finished college, jumped from job to job and had no clue where my life was going.. 

Then I met B. I met her just before I turned 22, and it was the best thing that's ever happened to me. She took away my pain and gave me help and support to steady myself in a way that nobody else ever had. I was so shut off from feelings and shut off from wanting to show emotion, that it took her a while for me to get me out of my cage that I had locked myself if.. but it was great, and I will always appreciate her for that... 

I moved home from Aberdeen where I had been to do college, due to a failed business attempt, and my flatmate was moving away too. B was staying in Aberdeen, and we decided on a ""long distance"" relationship. And it was fine, no problems whatsoever. I only lived a couple hours away on the train, so I saw her basically every weekend. Whilst home I started working with my dad, and just wanted to save money up. 

One day, girl A messaged me.. I didn't want anything to do with her but B told me to forgive her and be friends.. I guess she was just too trusting. I decided to tell A I forgive her and we can be friends, but I never messaged her or anything and was just polite when she messaged me, but in all I left her alone.. This is the part that makes my blood boil, and makes my heart ache.. B and I fell out over a friend she had trying to say shit about me.. (she hated me, and I had no reason why).. that night I messaged A and we had deep chats and one thing lead to another and flirtatious texts were sent and a couple photos. I felt horrible. And I stupidly kept it a secret.. this all happened in January or last year.. and then in June of last year, girl A told girl B everything, as I had deleted and blocked A out of my life and she didn't like that... I have no clue what sparked it.. my only regret is I wasn't considerate and honest enough to tell B about what I did... 

Flash forward to today and I'm alone.. and have been since June. And this brings me to how I currently feel, and why I'm frustrated with where I'm at.. obviously going through college taught me how to break out of my depression, and I've been trying to follow it but... Nothings working and has started revealing more problems.. 

If you've made it this far then thank you so much. There's not much more to read. 

I feel now lost more than ever. I've been going to the gym constantly almost every day for the past 4 months, to stay healthy and hoping it would keep me busy. I've gained weight, and physically I feel incredible. I've gone from 9st 9lbs to 11st and I feel I've finally escaped skinny me and all the people that made fun of my for looking like a rake (girl A). But it's not helped how I feel in my head.. 

I don't feel connected to my friends anymore, they've all moved away and I rarely get to see them, and most messaged go unanswered for days because they're busy.. I only have one friend that still lives in my town, and it pains me to say but I feel like the relationship isn't what it once was, and that we've gone on different paths, so it just feels awkward when I see him, however I do try to keep it going because I know isolation KILLS. 

I spend time with my family a lot, I love my family and they're very supportive and understand how I feel. However it just doesn't feel the same as hanging out with friends, and I find myself getting frustrated being around them a lot, even though they've shown me nothing but love, and it makes me feel even more awful feeling that way.

I've thrown myself in to further studies and with work. I'm studying accounting niw to keep busy, and I work hard at my job to keep busy and give me money. I spend all my time working, studying, gyming, hanging out with family, and trying to see friends, so my life is full, but my heart just feels empty. I feel like I'm rotting from the inside.. 

I also don't connect with any of the things that once we're a great pastime for me.. video games just aren't the same as they were, I don't connect to any of the nerdy shit I used to like and I don't know what else to be interested in.. 

And finally.. I miss girl B. I no longer contact her, as I know she hates me for betraying her. I know she's getting on with her life, new man, working hard, all that.. I've deleted and blocked her from everything and haven't looked to see what she's up to (I just know what she's up to due to a friend telling me without me asking which felt like a fucking knife..). The old 20 year old me wants to hook up with girls and ""get under someone to get over someone"" but, I can't. My head and heart won't let me. I've tried meeting up with a couple girls but I just can't get in to it at all, and I have no desire to be with them.. 

Just to put a cherry on top the ice cream, girl A is now dating a friend who lives back in Aberdeen, so I've decided to cut him out of my life.. because I can't have any connection to girl A.. that's done a lot of horrible things to me in my life. 

I don't know if any of this makes sense at all, or if I even deserve to be posting here.. I'm working hard, going to gym, even seeing a therapist, keeping busy as all hell.. but still I feel so numb inside and wake up crying at night, unable to get my head and heart to agree to keep looking to the future..

"Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram  (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out.  I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug? Thanks 

TLDR: Scared of the sexual side effects of Celexa, any positive experiences to ease my worry? ",3,Scared of the sexual side effects of Celexa
"Hey guys, so this might be a little long but I'll put a tl:dr at the end.

I've had depression ranging from severe to moderate (depending on the month tbh) for the past couple of years along with social/general anxiety, kickstarted by the loss of my dad and made worse through by going through college with 0 friends and having absolutely nothing social to do. Last year I went to a psychiatrist who put me on Paxil, told me it'd do away with both my depression and anxiety and gave me a bunch of BS advice about how to make friends and the like (common sense type stuff I already know and try). Well after a month of Paxil I kinda turned into a different person, my anxiety was completely gone but my depression was through the roof, leading to me making a LOT of bad decisions. I went back to my psychiatrist telling him that I didn't think it was helping my depression, and he said that's normal and upped my dose from 20mg to 30mg. This made everything WAY worse; I felt like I was slightly drunk all the time (only comparison I can think of), and my inhibitions were like always gone. I started smoking cigarettes, hiring escorts, getting in fights with people for no reason, just crazy shit I NEVER would have done before. My general anxiety came back and then some, I started having panic attacks almost daily, hobby's I used to love just seemed worthless and boring, it just made everything I took it to prevent worse. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but on Paxil they were daily. It culminated in my roommates having an intervention with me telling and reminding me of everything I'd done and just how much more of a miserable asshole I'd become. So I stopped taking the Paxil (those brain zaps were fun) and went back to my psychiatrist explaining all of this to him, and he told me it had nothing to do with the Paxil and I just wasn't following his advice (which consisted of ""talk to people"", ""you don't need friends in college"", ""girls will like you when you have a successful career in the future"").

Since being off the Paxil I have gone back to my old self, my roommates and my family have both told me I seem back to normal, I feel like I used to, I can enjoy video games and fishing again, but I'm still just as depressed and anxious as I was before the Paxil (plus now I'm hooked on cigarettes, so thanks for that Paxil). I went to my primary care doctor last week and explained all of this to him, and he recommended I see a psychologist, and gave me a script for 25mg Zoloft and .5mg Klonopin. I'm working on finding a psycologist at the moment, and the Klonopin helps a lot with my anxiety (though I know it's a benzo and not a long term solution), but I'm literally terrified to start Zoloft. I don't want to go through another experience like Paxil, I can say without a doubt that those 5 months were the worst most shameful and miserable of my life.

I feel like I'm in a pit and everything they give you just digs the pit even deeper, I just need some advice.

"In all honesty I'm not quite at the end of my rope, but I am doing pretty damn badly and I will be there one day if things don't change. I can barely talk to anyone, there's a barrier of thoughts, feelings and behaviours in my head and it makes me feel depressed all the time. CBT seems like it would help me so much, but I have no energy or focus or bother to stick with it or believe in it.

 I don't want medication to be a crutch. I want it to be a stepping stone up. I know I can be okay. I'm already somewhat half-okay, I'm on the right track, I just need to be able to change a few core behaviours and thoughts. On paper, medication would help with this. But the more I read, the more shit-scared I get. Seems like there's almost nothing but negative experiences online. Side effects, people literally becoming dumber/having cognitive impairment, people losing sexual function for months, years, sometimes forever, SSRIs being glorified placebos with side effects, heroin-like withdrawals, people tapering off and having their depression/anxiety later come back doubled, etc. It all just seems like some impossible insidious trap. The more I read the more I almost cannot believe these are prescribed.

 I'm not trying to be a fear-monger here. I've read some best-case scenarios of people going on medication, switching across a few until they found one without side effects, staying on it for only a few months or years until things were better, then slowly stepping off them and continuing to be okay, using the techniques and habits they built while on medication. Maybe all the bad things I've read are because people experiencing negative effects are more likely to be on reddit telling others about it. But there's just a sea of negative experiences, side effects and anecdotes out there which are impossible to ignore.

"Wall of text. Feel free to skip. I should say my psychiatrist did his fellowship at Johns Hopkins, the best medical school, and the ECT head went to Stanford and is certified in ect and connected to the (well-respected medical) university here (Tampa)

I have been diagnosed variously schizophrenia /schizoaffective /and even bipolar. I was in a psych ward and left for dead pretty much at 18, recovered completely after detox from a crazy psych cocktail, got B. A, M. A. even taught abroad. Had a very stressful illness in a minor city in China and whatever medicine given either caused or exacerbated some delusional thinking. But I recovered in a major Chinese city on what I assume was sedatives. When I got back to the US I couldn't sleep and eventually went on the antipsychotic paliperidone and klonopin after trying various medicines including trazodone and got a job teaching English as a second language at a university , but decided to go off the antipsychotic , which went poorly as heavy depression set in again sparked by illness followed by psychosis and hospitalization twice, both psychosis remitting after a few days. Stayed on the paliperidone. 

Flash forward to this fall. Eventually decided I'd had enough of the inhuman feeling of paliperidone, I became ridiculously depressed and was having issues with my body freezing in place and moving in genral. One medicine (memantine) I took made me suicidal to the extent that i was arrested and involuntarily held in a hospital that my neurologist had suggested I get ect in if Ativan didn't work. (he also diagnosed multifocal dystonia and catatonia, which the catatonia the psychiatrists didn't seem to agree with) 

I was lucky because psychotic depression set in mildly after a few days in the psych ward but no one noticed and the next day I had ect. Been through four sessions since. After the first, the suicidality and inability to move much and psychotic depression went away, and, eventually, after a few weeks, I began to feel a sense of happiness for the first time in at least ten years  

I've tried and has bad reactions to pretty much every atypical antipsychotic on the market, and been shot with Haldol at least 4 times. Also tried pristiq and wellbutrin with suicidal thoughts as side effects for the first one and clonus for the second, which I thought may have to do with serotonin syndrome

Currently taking klonopin 1mg 2x a day only. Psychiatrist thinks some people are not fit for antipsychotics as I always get all the side effects (Same with antidepressants)

"I'm feeling pretty bad most of the time lately.

I have my ups and downs like every normal person but I feel 'down' 90/95% of the time. I dont think this is healthy.

Lately every morning when I wake up I have this ANNOYING tingly feeling in my intensities. The same feeling you get when you're weightless (freefalling).

Also, I have a very negative thought pattern. I always look back on events (doesnt matter how small or big) and think negatively, or how it impacts me in a negative manner. This is also a very big part of my social anxiety. I always look back and think about the shit that makes me appear fucked-up instead of the things that make me appear awesome. 

I cant get out of bed easily, I avoid most social situations, I smoke weed daily and cant stop, I take drugs (one or a combo of the following: alcohol/ghb/2cb/nitrous/speed/4fmp/xtc/mdma/cocaine/ketamine) every weekend, I cant get a girlfriend because of my anxiety while my friends and siblings can, Even the fucking gym doesnt really
help either because I cant gain more muscle mass after my plateau. (Workout for 2.5 years, first year gained like 43 pounds while staying low bodyfat in the 1.5years, but stayed the same last full year eventhough I put in as much work as I always did)

All of this is making me incredibly sad. The drugs are the only fun thing I do. And video games occasionally but they dont entertain me as much as they did 2/3 years back.

Im 19 years old and I am thinking about calling a psychologist monday morning next week. Mainly because of my social anxiety and anger attacks (another emotionally-selfdestructive problem of mine), but I feel like I am slipping into a depression aswel. Any thoughts?

As my title says, depression has ruined my life. I've just broken up with my fiancÃ© because she found out I cheated on her. I know that makes me pure scum but it's made me realise how much I'm struggling to cope with life and that I need (and am getting) help. 

I've bottled up my depression for years which lead to ""episodes"". These ranged from assaults (which lead to nights in the cells), drug abuse, alcohol abuse, fits of anger, compulsive lying, erratic behaviour, and, at my lowest, cheating. Each of these came with extreme lows and ever increasing suicidal thoughts. I realised something needed to change soon or I would end it - it was that simple. 

It was my ex that told me to get help. It was my mum that came with me to my first counselling session (2nd one later this week) and to the GP (doctor). Both of these experiences were terrifying but extremely helpful. The GP is going to be putting me on antidepressants as he explained that I needed help with the low feelings I was having. I go back tomorrow once the GP has checked that a previous medical condition won't affect my treatment. 

I'm not sure I'm going to get through this as I'm still thinking about suicide almost every hour, but I'm going to try. I'm not willing to throw away the best 5 years of my life for nothing and I hope when I get better that I can try and rekindle my relationship and give my perfect girl the life she deserves.

"The past few years I've been going through some mental health changes that have become quite alarming. I was feeling generally down and had tried to combat it with exercise, surrounding myself with positivity, trying new hobbies, etc. Slowly things started to change, I was becoming anxious around crowds, I'd get flustered in grocery stores when crowded, started feeling like I wanted to avoid the gym because of people, crying became a regular thing and my family's life started to revolve around if I was going to get triggered by something negative which would send me into a spiral of sadness or anger. This is not typical of me and I'm watching it unravel in front of me. I feel crazy! I started getting into these fogs, nothing seemed to be as exciting as they should be to me, go to an amusement park? Get new camera equipment? Go hiking? I love those things but all of a sudden it just felt like they were happening around me and I was just there, just experiencing it, and it didn't feel good to me the way it should. Suicidal thoughts always accompanied my bouts of sadness, so I decided to get some help.

I went to see a counselor about how I was feeling. It was my first attempt to reach out and it went awful. Firstly, I should have mentioned that I had suicidal thoughts, but I didn't as I was ashamed of it, felt like it made me weak or that it would sound extreme. The councelor told me to stop pestering my family and that regardless if I went to therapy or took meds, they wouldn't work. That medication wouldn't work and that their therapist wouldn't have time to fit me in with their schedule and that I'd probably only get seen for 30 minutes at a time. I left feeling defeated and tried to use that to motivate myself to beat this on my own.

The past 6 months things have gotten worse. I was alarmed that one day I started feeling tired, like I was just done with ""feeling"" and wanted to die. It felt so casual to me to think that I wanted to electrocute myself in the bathtub and that it felt relieving to see a way to end this overwhelming feeling. I told my spouse to help me because I'm about to kill myself and I don't want to die, but I desperately hate this overwhelming whiplash.

We agree to try getting help again, but I put it off thinking I can try again to defeat it myself. Now, I've started getting panic attacks at the slightest hint of stress. It's like my brain is breaking. I start to hyperventilate and struggle to breathe. I've been getting sent into emotional spirals more often and again, I started thinking if I took some pain pills I could slit my throat in the bathtub.

My appointment is in a few days and I'm really nervous. I'm really sad about it because I feel like I'm crazy. I know that other doctor was wrong, but I'm afraid if this new doctor will be the same. I'm struggling so hard and I can't help myself anymore. I want to get help and I feel like I'm crazy that this is all happening because it's not me. I don't want to be like this and I don't want to have to live like this, in fear of my own self and getting triggered into sadness or hopelessness.

I don't want to self diagnose, but I think something is wrong with me. This is definitely not normal to me.
