"Hey everyone, I'm Jake and I'm 23 years old. I'm already started to give on my life now since September and i don't care about my life because its shitty, i have 2 speech impediments, no girls talk go me in school or anywhere, etc. I have so much anxiety and depression that Im losing my mind lately, plus I'm not eating enough and sleeping enough too because i don't feel like eating alot because i feel so upset at just everything in my life. I'm never happy anymore at all and i don't feel like living at times now too because of my problems while other peoples have fun in college, have friends and get married in a few years and have kids ,etc. My cousin just got engaged and most of my cousins are in relationships. I have a Speech Impediment called Verbal Apraxia with Stuttering which i had my whole life since i was born . i only had one relationship for almost 3 years in the past. I have been very depressed lately because i don't have a girlfriend like my twin brother and some cousins and friends that i have. i have good social skills because my nick name is the mayor Jake everywhere i go because i know and talk to everyone but i never talk to girls due to problems listed in this post.

I have some social anxiety too which makes me super scared to talk to girls because of my Verbal Apraxia with the stutter and it makes me very depressed. As i type this I'm having alot of anxiety and I'm about have a panic/anxiety attack too, when i have anxiety i have irrational thoughts like people are out to get me and other things like that . i feel like no girls will like me or give me a chance because of it if i approach them in real life because i can't even say my name correctly. when i talk, it sounds like a moderate deaf person and i hate it so much all of my life. Also i used tinder which my twin brother met his girlfriend on and have no luck even after many dates with different girls, now i am getting more depressed to the point of crying and not going out of the house too at times. My family is not the greatest at times too.I live with my mom and grandmother who makes everyone crazy which includes me. Every girl i talk to on tinder stop talking to me within a few replies too so i don't have idea what to do now too like what am i doing wrong? but my friend said i suck talking to girls too so im trying to improve that right now.

Lately I'm thinking I'm ugly too which i kinda believe that i am ugly because no girls like me while my family and other people says I'm not ugly. also I'm in community college so I'm missing the college experience of staying on campus making friends and meeting girls like everyone else is at my age because of my grades and possibly future degree in funeral directing. I am at home doing the online program for funeral directing while  All my cousins and my brother and everyone at my age  went away to college and im home missing out on everything when you stay at college like meeting girls and parties Also i live at home too that doesn't help me in meeting girls unlike everyone at college campuses. Im too scared to approach any girls because of my speech problems because I'm afraid of them not understanding me. i just can't do it due to anxiety because of my speech impediments and afraid of getting rejected. Also some of my anxiety is from school too because I'm very behind in my classes as of today because I have no motivation to do it because of how i feel sick almost all the time from all of my anxiety and depression too. Also due to all of this, i just got a new gym membership to go with my guy friends and i used it a couple times then i stopped going with them because i feel like my speech impediments make me awkward around girls and people . all my life i felt like people say things to pretend so i think they understand me sometimes. I only have 3-10 male friends while every other guy have female friends and stuff at my age. I don't know where to start or what to do at this point in time because i tried Tinder and that didn't worked for me. Plus when i message girls on tinder, they almost never respond back. i can talk to guys easily and other people easily but not attractive girls at all , let alone approaching girl to get their numbers.i can see myself being forever alone because of my speech impediments.Also i have been in speech therapy too for a long time when i was little and I'm not in it now. So i need help and advice right now from my fellow Redditors Thanks for your help and advice everyone !

tl;dr:i have Verbal Apraxia with stuttering which are speech impediments and i can't talk to girls due to the fear of not being understood and rejected of my speech impediments. Im scared of being forever alone while my friends and everyone is married and have kids in a few years while I'm not. To be honest, I'm almost 100% sure most girls will not date me because of my speech impediments and have a family. . What should i do at this point in time? Also should i try to approach and talk to girls that i like ? Because i want to over come this fear of talking to girls because i think they will not like me of my speech impediment.

Edit- Iâm getting  regular therapy weekly  now, also Iâm seeing the same therapist that I saw years ago when I was younger too and im going to the gym too now. I made a  tinder account too this week but almost every girl that i talk to stops talking to me or never respond to my first message. Im not in speech class right now i had it when i was little tho.",4,on't have a girlfriend like my twin brother and some cousins and friends that i have

"I got out of the army last year three months before I turned twenty eight and moved back into my mom and stepdads place because my credit was still ruined and I was still in debt from eight years earlier... because of my mom and stepdad. It's a long story and I won't go into detail but they stole money from me when I was twenty and it forced me into what seems to have been a perpetual road of nonstop failure and deep, deep, *deep* self loathing.

I injured myself in the army and got a nice chunk of permanent disability, making me set for the rest of my life. This is nice and all, but this wasn't my goal. I wanted to do my job in the army but no one ever elevated me. I wasn't hated either. That's the part I don't get. It seemed like everyone liked me but no one ever put even one extra second of effort to elevate me further. I watched everyone else get ahead as my physical state deteriorated and after four years, realizing I was going nowhere and was never going to get the qualifications to do my job on the inside or outside, opted for the medboard option.

When I got out I moved back home with my mom, stepdad, stepbrother and blood brother in a five bedroom prefab home because my credit still wasn't fixed, and what I saw enraged me. 

My mother had put on two hundred pounds, already weighing a sturdy four hundred. She'd sat in the same spot watching TV for the entire time I was in the army. My mom no longer abused me emotionally or physically but now she was doing this to my autistic stepbrother. She berated him daily. Even worse is that my stepdad was too wimpy to stop it and forked my mom over thousands upon thousands of dollars so she could buy fake little business licenses and crap off Amazon for the sole purpose of making sure no one else got my stepdads money... except for my brother.

I love my brother. He is my most prized person and we grew up together, but my mom has simply paid for him to sit on his ass and smoke weed, turning his mediocre hobby into a job with a whopping thirty thousand dollar ""loan"". I've never been treated this way. Since I was fourteen it was ""get a job"" while my brother was allowed to sit around and smoke weed while I busted my ass during all the best years of my life.

We lived out on eighty six acres and my mom wanted the land clear cut for some sort of farming operation, one of her hair brained schemes. It takes lots of time, money and machinery to clear cut eight six acres. She expected me to do it for free, by hand and with an axe. I said no.

At some point I began buying my own tools and storing them in the shed and would use them on and off again. Slowly I noticed they'd simply disappear. One day, when my mom thought I was gone, I watched her waddle into the shed, take a handful of my tools, walk them into the woods and toss them somewhere I could never find them. She'd toss my axes into the truck with the trash pile and take them to the dumpster. Nothing had changed. She was still hell bent on destroying my property and due to my credit I couldn't even get my own place. After three or four months of drinking, I broke and went to rehab.

I wound up moving in with my girlfriend. I won't badmouth her but we drifted apart during the army and she never got me on the lease, instead inviting a random girl to live with us who couldn't pay rent. Because I had no say, and things had fallen apart between us, it ended after a month and a half.

I moved back to a friend's uncle's place and for three months I got my finances in order. During this time I met up with a girl I'd known since middle school and had always had a crush on. Things went great. Our first date was awesome but she made it clear she was celibate and wanted to get married before having sex. It was annoying but like I said, I'd known her since middle school.

We dated for three months. Not like we were going out as girlfriend and boyfriend but going places and having deep discussions about our future lives together. Ya know, all that sappy relationship stuff.

We finally went on our final date and she invited her friend. The date was awesome... until her friend got drunk. We went camping for three days and on day three I assume her friend saw the attention she was paying to me and cut a nice wedge between us and berated me for hours. It wasn't anything I couldn't handle but sometime around midnight I fucking exploded after she made up another story and called me out for something that I wasn't even lying about. That night I asked the girl I was dating if this was worth pursuing and she crawled out of our tent and into her friends. She later claimed she was drunk and thought I made a move on her but it was worse than that, she'd had a boyfriend the entire time and was intentionally friend zoning me and hadnt expected me to find out if this was worth my time. 

It gets worse than that though, there was absolutely nothing between us, at least on her end. She hadn't been attracted to me one single bit. Even worse is that during our falling out discussion, she wouldn't even admit she had a boyfriend, I had to find out later through friends and hearsay. The last time I spoke to her she just cut me off for admitting how I felt and being upset but she never blocked or deleted me from Facebook. She just saw my messages for a month and would occasionally reply with a snippy one word answer until I blew up and forced her to block me. THIS finally seems to have broken me. A month or two earlier she talked me into getting an apartment on a year lease so we could have somewhere to hang out when she was in my neck of the woods, so now I'm fucking stuck with an apartment until August, in a part of town I moved to because I could find a free place to stay until I was able to get back on my feet, where I only know a small handful of people.

I am using my GI bill to go back to college and maybe I'll find some purpose and a woman to live my life with, but everyone my age is married with two kids and a house. I missed out on the entirety of my twenties, and blew it with a girl I'd known since the sixth grade and felt totally fucking berated. I haven't bothered to find anyone or make friends or even to make eye contact with anyone lately and have relapsed multiple times.

I just want to take my meager army money and buy land and be a fucking hermit and live the rest of my life wondering about what could have been if I'd been raised better by loving and hard working parents, or had opportunity, or had someone say ""you're next in line for success and great things"", but none of that happened. I don't think it's because I'm hated, because people genuinely seem to like me, but that's it. I'm just that guy with the pearly smile who's fun to talk to but nothing more. 

On a final note, I will say this. I got out of the army and I remembered how social I was *before* I joined, but once I got out I saw how everyone had moved on or had burned out. I'm in purgatory. Im somewhere between success and failure. I'll never hit rock bottom because my body gave out under the strain of army life, but I'll never make more than I work for in an entrepreneurial manner. I've thought about opening a bar or something like that but I've been denied a home loan and VA business loan so many times that it's now affecting my credit despite only having one tiny and insignificant debt left.

It doesn't matter I guess. I'm boring, I'm bored and I don't know what to do and the world has moved on from when I was young.

"Just a quick rant about my problems to make me feel better and get some weight off my chest. Each paragraph is sorta itâs own thing.

Iâm almost 16, in high school, getting over losing a girl I love(d) because she cheated on me a while back and was really toxic even though we were crazy for each other. Iâm actually doing okay though. Thatâs not my worst problem.

I have it really good. My family makes really good money, super stable job, nice little cozy home, never moved, happily married parents that I have great relationships with and I get privileges like being born a tall white male in the suburbs/country in the best country in the world but yet Iâm not happy.

Itâs not that Iâm sad, I just feel numb to things. I donât get a feeling like my brainâs active and happy. Is this what depression is? I feel dry and stale. 

My health is bad. Iâm a type 1 diabetic; ever since I was 6 and ever since Iâve been a teen itâs been really out of control. Itâs fucking with me mentally and the constant high blood sugar does physical things to mess with your mood too. 

Because of my diabetes I canât do the only thing Iâve ever been good and passionate about, be a marine. Itâs entirely off the table. It feels really hard having this sometimes. But I think about how I could have cancer or HIV while starving in Africa as an orphan with no education and it just makes me feel like a pussy. Pride and integrity are important to me but I really do just feel shitty all the time and feeling bad just makes me feel bad so I feel worse and so on.

I feel so numb and like, hyper aware and lacking of those good chemicals in your brain. My whole life I always wanted to go hunting. The first time I ever killed a deer it was a great experience on paper, but I felt like I was acting being happy the whole time. I didnât feel much excitement and it broke my heart. I wanted to be out there with everything in me, but it was like I had played this level of the game over and over, even though it was entirely new and âexcitingâ.

I hate school. Itâs where I get all of my social interaction, sure, but in reality itâs a horrible attempt to teach on a massive scale, and itâs like a holocaust for young mental health. Iâm smart but I feel like my brain cut me off 100 steps up a 1,000 step mountain. I feel unmotivated and limited to what I know I can do. I used to be a really good student and this year I literally just donât do anything even though Iâm in the upper level classes.

And even if I did great in school, whatâs it for? I donât feel interested in doing much else. 

I would never hurt myself in anyway. But I really do wonder what Iâm living for sometimes; even though other times I canât fathom how Iâd feel that way, and I force myself to be positive and like myself and feel a little better.

I donât like myself. My hair is really bad and I canât fix it really, I think Iâm gonna go bald, I just donât like my face much, I hate complaining about this this shit and feeling bad in my situation. I donât know if my personality is who I want it to be.

So I realized my depression is better at home, when I can be with my dogs. Thatâs partially because I have to take care of them.

"Hi guys, I might need some help.

I'm dangerously close to becoming a full alcoholic. Whenever I feel down, i grab the bottle. Sometimes I get drunk 3 times a week, the minimum is 2, but sometimes it's even 6 times a week. Just got out of an 11 day drinking binge.
I'm only 18, I can't let the booze take over. My friends and I joke about, just because they don't know the extent of the problems and I'm too pussy to tell them.
I just feel so much better when I'm drunk. I am smarter, more social, don't think about my problems as much (until an hour after the last glass, then the depression really hits hard.). 
I just always feel like I have wasted the last 18 years of my life. I have litteraly nothing to be proud of. It hits hardest when my friends asked what I've done all day, and I just have nothing to say.
So whenever I'm down, I'll get drunk, knowing I'll feel better for a while.

The depression itself isn't that bad, it's not always there. I feel perfect half the time. Dunno if it's even a real depression.

Took half an hour just writing this, as I can't type correctly anymore, so I have to write the whole thing basically three times to make it correct.

"Finally going to therapy for some long-standing issues. Iâm pretty sure Iâve been in a low-key state of depression for the majority of the last 3 years. Iâve been going to therapy now for 3 months. However, Iâm not sure if things are going the way they should be as Iâve never done it before, and have nothing to compare it to. 


**Here are some âprosâ  about my therapist:** 


- Specializes in my issues

- Good listener

- Empathetic 

- Takes my insurance so itâs pretty affordable 

- I am comfortable being vulnerable around her and telling her everything


**Here are some things I find questionable. Please help me decide if this is normal:**


- Only took notes during the first session (Iâm not sure if she takes notes after the session or not)

- No homework or things to work on. When I asked if there was something more I could do about a certain thought pattern, she said I was already doing it just by going to therapy. End of story. 

- No direction or check-ins. I do 99% of the talking. She never directs the conversation or checks-in about stuff we have talked about. She waits for me to initiate all talk. If I spent the entire session talking about some silly tv show I saw, she wouldnât direct it back towards anything. 

- Her responses to almost everything are âhow do you feel as you are saying that?â Or âthere are a lot of layers to your pain.â 

- Not sure that Iâm making progress towards anything. It all just feels like Iâm unburdening to a third-party. I don't feel better after my sessions and I don't feel like I've gotten any better. 

- I have twice asked her if I should be on antidepressants. Both times, she seemed reluctant to even talk about it. We left off both times with me being no more clear about whether or not I should pursue this, how to go about getting a prescription (can she do it? Do I go to my family doctor? Either way, she never gave me my options or how to move forward)

But now I am so utterly depressed. Cutting was my unhealthy outlet but I relied on it to feel better. Now I don't have any way to release or at least nothing that equates to self injury.

For anyone who has successfully quit cutting, how did you do it? Because right now, two weeks in, I only feel so much worse. ",4,had friends that tried to help but I could never get myself to stop
"Hey reddit

So i've decided to get myself tested for depression. Ever since i was about 13,14 (am 21 now) i've had these feeling of dread and just haven't been happy with myself. I have talked about these feeling recently with some of my mates and they all think i do have depression this also includes my EX who has tried to get me to go doctors for the last 2 years. So the reason why am posting here is too ask what i should expect from the doctors (i live in the uk) and what will change if i decided to go on antidepressants? 

Any advice would be useful am not very good at sharing my emotions unless am pissed up.",4, my EX who has tried to get me to go doctors for the last 2 years
"after a 3 year hiatus of putting off medication and therapy, I finally made the dreaded decision to start again (just drugs for now I think, we'll see how that goes) and asked for my mother to schedule an apt. this is for severe anxiety, social anxiety (or avpd) and depression (diagnosed those 3 years ago).

my mind is blank and I am not sure how to express / describe myself so that they can effectively gather information and prescribe the drugs they see fit. I'm afraid of freezing up and being incapable of speaking honestly. but knowing this is my anxiety speaking, it'll probably go well and be over before I know it... or it could seem to last an eternity and I'll feel trapped the whole time, as per usual.

don't know why I've typed this. guess it would be nice to receive some advice, experiences, what to say, etc. not expecting replies though.

gonna take a hot shower, then ponder about this until I fall asleep.

goodnight.

"My mother has been depressed most of her life from what I can tell.  She and my father are separated.  He's struggling with his own battle.
I'm 24 in college and I live about an hour away.  I come home nearly every holiday, because when I was living at home during community college she became very dependent on me(to do household chores, and support her emotionally). 

She's lost her white collar job about a year ago.  She make some bad choices, transferred to a position that wasn't right for her, and got let go.  Now she's working at a warehouse job that too physical for her(out of shape).  I'm worried that her depression is getting worse and worse.  I can't quit college to move back and take care of her.  Nor, do I think that is the way to really help her.  

Every time I come home her house becomes dirtier and dirtier.  She's missing bills, becoming more reclusive, and I'm worried she depleting her savings/retirement.  She isn't taking care of herself and not really trying to fix any of this.  She's becoming more disillusioned with her job search for another white collar job.

She is going to therapy and taking medication, but I don't really see any improvement (actually the opposite).   I don't know what to do.  I really want to help her but I don't know how without enabling her dependence on me.  ",4,She and my father are separated.  He's struggling with his own battle
Went out to a bar on New Years and ended up dancing singing and making out with this super cute random girl all night. We were popping bottles of champagne drinking straight from the bottle it was so much fun and the only intimacy I've had with a girl in probably over a year (I'm 22). I never even got her name or number but I'm so fucking lonely that I can't stop thinking about her. It's pathetic. She prob hasn't thought about it since yet I can't get it off my mind. I keep looking at Snapchat vids we took together too because it's the only fun I've had in years and I don't want it to end. Idk I feel like a fucking loser ,4,"can't stop thinking about her, It's pathetic"
"Alright, So I'm fucked out of my mind. In less than 2 hrs i drank 6 beers and a half bottle of free wine I got. I think I'm at rock bottom. I don't know where to start. I'm in my late 20's. Never had a GF, never thought I deserved one. I make every friend Ive ever made just feel sorry for me and then i push them out of my life. I'm so fucking alone. But that's because i want to be. But I fucking dont. I want to be somebody and happy. But my brain keeps telling I dont. I go out with my only friend maybe once a month. She ain't really a friend, she just pities me. Or I guess maybe she is my friend because she pities me and cares enough to try. idk, I cant figure it out. Even though I want to be personable and fucking fun to be around, I constantly just fuck it up. Then I just think about it for the rest of the month and keep playing in my mind how to redeem myself. Then i fuck it up again.

 Ive never been to a doctor. what do i do? just say my head is fucked up give me something to make me feel normal? i have shit health insurance. i hate my job i dont want to work extra just to pay for meds and therapy. why am i on this sub. i  sound like a 4 yr old haha mods just delte this. but seriously see what i mean about wanting pity? but also feeling feeling bad about wanting pity? Stop drinking? you nuts? I've been drinking like this for months now. it does help with the depression at least im not just staring at a fucking wall like usual. there i go with the pity thing. haha christ i sound like a madman. lets see how far this goes.

"It was not to long ago until I realised how lonely I am. I hang out with same 4 friends every time who I'm not comfortable with sharing anything because they are immature and make fun out of every little thing their is. Girls don't want to hang out with me because I'm not a typical douchebag like almost everyone. I would ask them out just so we could chat, but that isn't working out. 


With that being all said I developed this ""someone"" with who I talk to. Coming from a religious family I have grown up to believe in God, so I think I relate this someone with God. I tell all my problems and I request they would go away. My problems only got worse and worse so one night when I was on the edge of breaking down I realised I'm actually talking to no one but myself. When I actually came to this conclusion I fucking broke down pretty hard. Tears were running down my face and all I could think about is how much of a baby I am. I started hitting myself so it would go away. 


When I started to physically hurt myself I told myself it's enough, go get some help. I know the internet isn't the best place to be around in a situation like this, but there is still enough hope left in me for me to believe there is someone who can relate to me. These are all new stuff I'm experiencing since I never had problems like this.

"I've been dating this guy who treats me like a million bucks- and respects me, my opinions, makes sure we talk everything through when there's an issue, voices his feelings, asks me to see him in person when he wants to bring something up so there's no misinterpretation, brings me flowers on my hard days at work, answers me, always, notices all the little things, like my random upper cheek dimple, the way I bite my lip when I'm concentrating, and how I tuck my hair behind my ear when I'm nervous.

And here I am, unable to feel strongly about him, never responding to him on time, flaking out on seeing him, constantly.

"Like the name say, I just don't feel right. Do I am an alien? Human are supposed to be social creature and I don't really feel social. Also I don't feel I like I'm a teenager, all teenager of my age (I'm a 18 yrs old male guy) like partying, alcohol and drug while me I hate parties and stuff, I'm getting depressed and I feel like I'm the only clean teenager who doesn't like partying, I'm starting to feel alone in this shitty world...
(I don't know where to place this, I felt both need help in social and depressed...)


More context, I feel people are always talking and me I just say nothing, I wish I could talk but I can't think of anything, I don't know what to say... People may think: your conversation skill are bad, sure yeah I have trouble talking to people but when I feel people listen to me, they like me, they talk to me and I know what to say it's kinda a knife slicing into butter even some people say it to me.

But I get depressed, I feel WAY too different from guy of my age, everyone are like: partying everydays, having tons of friends, drinking beers, sex, drug... and me I prefer staying at home playing video games, being online, taking no drug, having no sex (Well I kinda want that one but I got no girlfriend and I don't wanna pay that shit) and feel not comfortable at parties or in social groups.

Today, there was a social meeting or party at my job with almost all the staff, I felt that was like one of the worse decision of my life... It's not that I hate people there I like everyone there and can talk to them normally but I just felt too different and alone there. There like two persons arround my age and normally there that girl I can talk to her but today meh... she was talking to the other guy and I kinda felt ignored because I don't say anything... For me, people talk unless you talk to them but what you do when you have nothing to say and how do you reverse the situation?

"HI there everyone. This is extremly long, I want to finally ~wake up~ , so, if you don't have free time, don't read. Sorry If I let my emotions to take over my writing.

 This is the first time I open myself like this, to a bigger community or a larger group. First of all, I'm 15, young, ain't I. I don't think age matters, anyway. My life so far was and is pretty rought. My mother died when I was 7, because of cancer. Even though I was young, I wasn't stupid. I knew what happen when I was called at my school ~office~ or whatever it is called to be told. 

One of my friends mom adopted us. By us, I mean my brother and my sister. She is one of the best and most powerfull pearsons I know. She already had a daughter and was divorced. We had to move, 2 times, because of some issues with the rent. She and fought and is fighting, in a way or another for us. She is the reason why me and my sister have a roof above our heads right now. She took a part of an old building, raised it from nothing, without anyone helping her, just a women, alone. She renovated and âupgradedâ the interior of the house. 

Years and years later, my brother left us. Just because he's ~different~ and has another sexual orientation discussion starter to occur. He left, found someone who he loves, and, lives happily, in a way or another. I'm happy that he found his way, but I could never understand why he left.

I was a pretty mediocre and am, talentless and a bother. My way of being it's like, helping the others, and disappearing. After I know the pearson is good, I want to fade, but I can't, because they attach.

My stepmother family is pretty fucked up in the head. One has drinking problems, and her mother and her sister. Oh god, they are the worst. None shows their real face, only after a while, that's one leason I learned after so many years. We had our updown in family, but everything is their fault, for jabing into our lives.

Here, in my country, and in my city, the salary isn't worth anything. That's why she went in another country, actually found someone, found the PERFECT job for her, but, with that the problems came.

Since she is far and her job can't allow it, she can come two or three times home. I don't have a problem with it, I know how much she was struggeling with this dumb life in this country, and I'm happy she can finally start her life, it's never late.

But I'm alone, with my sister. She's an adult, she can take care of me, that's not the problem here. She had some job problems, was thrown out, and because of that, money issues came in. Money, after money, after money. That isn't such a big issue, or that's what anyone would think. Apparently it is, in this dammed family, they are all judging, throwing her, disrespecting her and ~spitting~ on her.

She was on the merge of suicide so many times, but she can't do such thing, because I'm still in her life. She still fights for me, otherwise she would be gone a long time ago. Since we went throught a lot, we aren't the type to show our affection, our love, and like all the people, make mistakes. We love our stepmother, she did what many can't do, but we feel like we are thrash, and want to die, both of us.

Since my stepmother is far, and I don't know why this is happening, she can't control her life alone, not anymore. She let's other pearsons, like her mom, and the idiot that she found, but unfourtunately loves, dig in, they are making the decision for her, and that hurts. We love her, but we are being constantly ~stabbed~, because of her blindness.

Whatever we say is put against us, we are being gossiped by them, thrown on the window, disrespected, literally thrashed by her family. That hurts, and I'm on the merge of totally giving up. We've been fighting, resisting, but it hurts like hell.

My sister found her love, but, because of the fact that he is a gypsy, they all judge her. She doesn't know what to do anymore, in order to reconcile both sides, she can't do anything, because nothing is enough or good for them, they are a bunch of incompetents. Judging her over and over, when that men helped us more than they did. That's just stupidity. 

We've been hurt, over and over. Now I understand why our brother left, because of this family.

After I grew up, I found myself in a depression. An extremely severe one. I can't get out, I found amazing people but, because of the doings of my own hands, I lost them. I lost a her that she helped me for an entire year, because I'm a liar and lazy pearson. I want help but I don't want them to get in, because they will feel bad, my situation will completely ruin their happiness. So I found myself sad, depressed, talentless. The only things I have left are my dogs, which I love the most on this planet. From three, I was left with two, and god knows when, with one. I feel like the power I have left is with my dogs, but, when they will be gone same I will. I want to disappear, completely. That was I will end my suffering and make this family realize what the hell they did wrong the whole time. My stepmother is great, did amazing things, but one thing she didn't gave us was love and affection.

I'm spending nights playing, school isn't going that great, I have another way of thinking and I really don't bother with it. I just, can't. Playing and spending my days on PC, even though I don't want to. I want to have a talent, to grow up and save everyone that in my situation, to grow up as an artist, singer, anything. I just want a talent.

I drew a long time ago, lost my talent because of the lack of motivation and depression. Started guitar alone, but don't have the motivation because I feel like I'm a failure. 

A long story, and I'm thanking you all who reached this part, you are amazing just by spending time reading. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I'm depressed, I'm thinking of things a 15 shouldn't, thinking of suicide nowadays, because of the situation we are in, thinking so much, being dead inside and having a huge gap in my hearth because of the things I lost so far, and because I can't do anything proper.

I need help, what should I do in order to change myself, I'm just at the begging of life and thinking of ending it. I hate this world and everything around it, because I was raised with hatred and ~fights~. I want help, to cure my deep depression, to regain my happiness, to see the world colorfull again, I want to be normal, again. What can I do, nothing motivates me and nothing makes me happy anymore.

Some backstory:
I'm currently attending college.
I have a body focused repetitive disorder that popped up around early high school and has since been a lot better. I've always been a bit on the depressed side since middle school with low self esteem. 



One reccuring thing is in certain situations I become very stressed (?) to the point where my mind just digs itself into a hole of despair and I have episodes of just crying and feeling extremely awful. Most recently, I've been triggered by my boyfriend.


At first it was just arguments over random things we disagreed on and slowly the crying episodes came on. Eventually I think it's just instances of him being mad at things I don't do on purpose but are sometimes wrong and me feeling so bad about myself that I get into that mind space and can't get out. He thinks of them as tantrums and doesn't know how to deal with or help with them. 


Even at home, when I think too much I focus on all the bad and this happens again. I start doubting my relationship because of all the bad stuff, I start feeling bad about my life etc.



For the most part I really like my relationship. Outside of the arguments we fit together really well. He's very sweet and caring. 


Does anyone know what I might be experiencing and how to fix it?

"Today I finally got the strength to finally get help with my depression.  Still trying to figure out the logistics of when my first appointment will be with the doctor but Iâm proud I am taking a step in the right direction.

I think my slide into depression the last 6 months is from the loss of my dad as well as some other personal issues (hated my job/fallout with some friends/bad breakup) but it took 6+ months after all that for me to finally realize I needed help. I was sleeping in, just watching tv/playing Xbox and avoiding my friends at times when I started to feel anxious.  I started becoming more and more of a recluse but at this point Iâm done with this feeling.

I have gotten a new job and mentioned to my boss that I might need to show up an hour late on Fridays for my therapy.  She couldnât have been more understanding and supportive of it.  I was nervous as hell to tell her but glad I did (depression hasnât effected my work, in a weird way itâs the one part of my life I have felt empowered/productive).

Sorry for this rambling but I am only posting this to hopefully encourage others to do the same.  I know everyoneâs depression is different you can get help.  I also know I have a ways to go and this is only a small baby step.

I have been lurking at this page lately and have been moved by the posts Iâve seen. I hope everyone here finds happiness soon, and I know thatâs not easy.  ",4," the loss of my dad as well as some other personal issues ,hated my job,fallout with some friends,bad breakup"
"I finally went out to do something with my few friends. I've had a crush on one of them for at least 3 years and one of my other friends that knew was also asking a girl out there and said I should ask the one I liked as well. 

I was really scared because I've never had a girlfriend and the one time I asked someone I was rejected and I'm terrible at speaking to people and I just freeze up when I get nervous which was definitely happening now. I tried to talk to her and of course I froze up and made everything awkward and ruined everything. 

Every time I try to do something I screw it up. I feel like I'm not good at anything. My dad and step-mom don't take me seriously. They say I'm lazy because I never do anything but I'm afraid because every time I leave my room I mess something up. I can't make food, can't socialize, video games aren't fun to me anymore because I hate playing alone, I tried skating but I don't have money to buy new equipment and all I have is a tiny Penny board that my feet are too big for, my family expects me to have high grades because I used too be considered the smart one but my grades have fallen so now the one thing I was considered good at is gone and I keep disappointing everyone, the one family member I have that truly loves me is in prison because of an assault charge and everyone in my family hates her, and now I've probably lost another one of my few friends because I can't do anything right.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't really want to live but I know I'm not going to commit suicide. I've thought about it but I'm too scared and I don't want to hurt my mom more than she already is. I don't know why I'm posting this.

The transition has been difficult i feel alienated and haven't made any friends for four years other than brief online relationships.

Unfortunately the move also took me out of school past the age of 13 i haven't had an education. My mom is to busy to maintain homeschool and my stepdad doesn't care for me as he does my mom. I was born in another country and he already has two children of his own I guess this is why he doesn't pay attention to me.

It's hard being alone or feeling that way I've always wanted to meet someone my own age I dream of it. Some days i wake up and I'll sneak out of the house to the park and hope to meet someone.

"I don't think I've typed here much.. but it's probably going to be my second or third time.
Many years ago I was into a long distance relationship that started with a solid friendship in 2010. After years this guy from Mexico left and  I spent years alone, literally crying until falling asleep. That left in me some serious trust issues. Years later in 2016 I started talking to a guy from Texas. He had gone through a lot of stuff and I felt like I could help him. Things were going right, we were friends and started a long distance relationship I loved. The problem is that he stated changing and we were arguing a lot. My trust issues didn't help either. I became too demanding and he kept ignoring me. One day I broke up with him and I was an idiot thinking he would try to get me back but he didn't. I found out he had someone else. Another long distance relationship. It killed me. I thought he was gone, but during all 2017 he has been typing, sending messages and telling me that he would leave her at some point and would come back because he loves me. He told me he doesn't love her and tried to break up with her (that was true, but she said she was going to kill herself if he leaves her) so he stayed with her. A week ago I got so mad at him for his decision of staying with her that I insulted him. I called him a coward, an idiot and much more. My temper doesn't help much either.
He replied and said he didn't care about me anymore and he blocked me everywhere. I can't sleep. I can't eat, I can't live. 

I think I fucked up and lost the only guy who ever showed some interest in me. I'm dumb, kind of nerd, not pretty and stupid. I don't think I'll get anyone else in probably years since I only had two relationships (both long distance ones) and I had to wait like 3 years for the next one to happen. (the last one I had) 
I think I am doomed to die alone.

You know, when you and your significant other argue. Those types of days.

But what happens when you think she's lost trust in you? It's a worse feeling than some of you think.

Maybe then, that's not necessarily a bad day. Some people have it worse. Even I know that. 

But sometimes it turns into something a little worse.

The truth was, was that I hadn't been talking to anyone else. I had swore up and down that I hadn't been, I mean, she was on vacation and I had promised to always be faithful.

And I had been. She just didn't understand the real truth that I had been telling her. She wouldn't believe me. 

I made bad decisions. This seems simple to anyone else who'd be reading this.

We argued some more. She blocked me right before I had gone to shower and that's right around when I realized some things.

I realized that I was a bad boyfriend, although I had always been faithful and loyal.

A bad friend.

Moments later, I could feel that familiar pattern of water patting on my back as it does every night right after my usual 5 hour shifts, every day.

Why people killed themselves.

"This is a throw away account.

I have never been in a relationship with someone and never had sex or sexual contact with anyone either. I know that isn't really a HORRIBLE thing at all. But I am starting to wonder why?

Story: The only guy I have attracted to a possible relationship has severe depression and general anxieties disorder. He is kind of a shut-in and plays videogames and does drugs when he is not working. That's the extent of his life that I am aware of. I have known him for a few years and at some points durng those years were very close and talked about getting into a serious relationship. At some points, he called me his girlfriend but we never have been REALLY at that point. He used to tell me that he cared about me a lot. He would go through depressive phases and disappear sometimes. When he came back it was always the same. ""I'm sorry, I'm not a good person, I'm bad at relationships, I want to die, etc"".

I still try to get through to him even now. He ignores me or tries to set up a hook-up date and then pretty much just blows me off anyway.

I'm starting to wonder less about him and more about me. My friends say that he is not capable of a relationship and it is not a reflection of my worth that he is not receprocating my feelings. But at the same time... if this is all I can get, is this a reflection of me? Am I depressed because I am alone... or am I alone because I am depressed?

Will getting into a relationship with someone make me feel any better? I used to think that I could help him by showering him with my affection and attention. I used to think that if he did this to me, I would feel better and everything would be solved.

For some reason, I think this is foolish now. Maybe it's just growing through the attachment and coming out from the other side in hindsight. Maybe it's just getting tired of him not liking me back. I don't know.

I feel like there is a connection between being alone and being depressed though. I feel like if I would have some thing or someone to support me, I would be more likely to overcome or be motivated to overcome other things. I know that's weak. I just get exhausted and lonely sometimes. Going through all my life without anyone has really been difficult but I'm not trying to whine about it, please don't think that.",4,He ignores me or tries to set up a hook-up date and then pretty much just blows me off anyway

I must call my grandma. In fact, I must try to reach all of the people who once meant a lot to me, before itâs too late.",4,avenât reached out to people who once meant very much to me
"I'm leaving for a trip to Colorado for 6 days with a friend. I live with my fiance who has been with me for 8 years. She's always had depression/anxiety issues, and when I go on a trip without her (which is once every 2 years maybe) she gets upset to the point where she's in a rut and can't be productive, etc. I understand it because I have the same feelings..to a milder degree. So I'm trying to figure out what I can do to help her be happy during my absence. Any ideas? I would convince her to spend time with a friend each day, but she has limited friends these days since her best friends moved to different states.

"Hi, I've had pretty bad depression and anxiety issues since i was in middle school and have pretty much hated myself ever since i can remember. I'm also an introvert and generally cant stand to be around people other than a select few. I Went to a therapist early in highschool who said i had some form of depression, but my parents never really followed through getting any medication for me (i dont think they really believe depression is a problem). I've been in a pretty huge slump since I've been out of high school (almost 4 years) compounded by the fact that just recently my best friend decided he would check out early. I want to get some professional help before things get any worse. I have a job and insurance but not a lot of money. I am not suicidal (i guess i was up until recently and i found out how bad being on the other end feels), but now that this is no longer an option i feel like i am just trapped in a 100 foot hole with no way out. 

Really i am posting because i have questions i am hoping to have answered by anyone with experience on the subject.

1. Is a general practice doctor usually someone who can prescribe anti depressants? Im not sure my insurance would cover any sort of mental health doctor.(i generally hate doctors and pharmaceuticals and avoid both at all costs, hopefully until now as i cant really see any other resolution)
2. How do i know if they(drugs) would even help? Any particular  ""feelings"" they prevent? 
3. Do they help with anxiety or would that be something else? 
4. Do they affect you physically? (Weight gain/loss, energy, ect.)
5. Generally speaking are any of the pharmaceuticals i might be prescribed expensive?

Thanks for any help/advice anyon can give in advance.",4, my parents never really followed through getting any medication for m
"Well, this person is useless, society doesn't need them, no one does. But that makes these people lonely, and sad, trying to figure out what they did wrong alone, while constantly trying the fact that anything is wrong at all. This is how I've felt for the past two years.

I don't think that everyone has the same view that I just described, but for me, that is as I see it. I am alone, sad and depressed, just hoping that someone would see me, and say more than just a rushed hello as they walk by, back into the mob of the others who followed suit. But I guess that's too much to ask, why would anyone see me as someone to talk to, what could I possibly, say to make someone feel as if i haven't wasted their time?

I don't know how many other people feel the same, but I don't like to burden other with my problem, and that's why I've kept quiet and I know that by posting here I'm completely contradicting what I just said, but, I need help, and going to a forum of people that want to give their help willingly doesn't make me feel like as much of a burden, I hope whoever is reading this shares similar views.

To those of you who are left, thank you, I hope your day is going far better than mine. I'll try to kept this last part quick. 

I never thought my first post on reddit would be me opening up out my depression, but here I am. I need help, but I don't want to waste the time of people that could use it in better ways than talking to me. So to end this off, I want to know if anyone here has gone through something like this before, and what they did to win.

Please help, I don't want to be alone anymore.",4,don't like to burden other with my problem
