"A pragmatic person looks at the practical side of things. Pragmatism is a dispassionate form of common sense.

Stop telling yourself that you canât. Stop believing that you canât. I know it hurts. Instead of letting feelings sweep you away, practice approaching them pragmatically.

.............................................................................................

How can you begin to live my life in a more pragmatic way?

Basically deal with things in a sensible and realistic manner.**Be organised.** It is a simple thing to do and will have the most effective results in every aspect of your life, be it at home, in highschool,college, in your place of work.  A tidy life, will lead to a tidy mind which in turn will lead to you making better decisions when you need to be sharp, alert and on the 'button' when it comes to problem solving and taking action.

**A confession:**

You cry and suffer alone. Nobody is there to help you. There is this form of helplessness that goes from you crying nearly every day, till you realize that nobody is there to hear you. Crying then becomes pointless.

Crying is a distress signal, if the signal isnât answered, itâs useless. So what happens? Well, your brain tries to find other ways to deal with suffering. As a result of nobody answering your distress calls, your brain learns over time that every single problem that youâll EVER suffer from for the rest of your life, you must solve alone. Period.

The world has given us the middle finger and said âGoodluck dumbass, youâre on your own!â You learn that because nobody was there for you, you become 99.99% reliant on YOURSELF. You are now the only person you can trust. Everyone else means nothing to you. Why care about someone if:

1. They werenât ever there for you, and

2. Youâve already learned how to be reliant on yourself, you donât need people anymore.

You develop this zenn state where you feel as if youâre in a bit of an odd trance, like nothing really matters as much as you think it does and you stop putting emotions into just about anything.

As a result of your abuse, your problems stop feeling like problems. I hypothesize that the reason behind this is because when you were having problems, nobody was there to help you. There was no empathy for you and you were always left solving problems yourself.Eventually you just learn to cope with it by looking for solutions instead of self-loathing and whining about it because whenever they showed signs of distress, nobody was there to pick them up.

"2 days ago, I called the national suicide prevention hotline. They werenât that great in helping me out. All they said was that they can only help by talking to me and looking for ways I can help myself. Like nearest clinics or facilities to get help, for groups and therapy etc. I am very depressed. I have been for 8 years. Iâm 24 years old and I have lost interest in a lot of things I used to love doing. Playing the piano? Canât do it anymore. Want me to draw something? Iâm a lost artists now... I canât seem to do anything good anymore. 
I donât have any friends and Iâm very lonely. Last time I hung out with someone other than my family was back in 2010. 8 years ago..   no one really invites me to places, no one asks and how Iâm doing. I donât think anyone cares that I exist. Now I know my family does, but thatâs not enough because they think this thing I have is all in my head. 
It actually is, but they think it can be cured by getting a girlfriend or something like that. Iâve had relationships before, even when I was still like this. It didnât help. 
It felt like I was in love with someone and knowing Iâm worthless at the same time, constantly wondering why the hell this person even loves me. 
I have never went out either. I have always been a lonely soul. 
My mother gave me some self help DVDâs sheâs had for the longest and I donât think thatâll help either... 
therapist, psychiatrists, groups, etc... all they want is money and my insurance is not the best so I canât even get into that. Not that itâll help anyway. Talking to anyone about how I am or feel doesnât make me feel better.. I feel like my life has gone nowhere and itâs too late for it.

So. I charged my iPad today. And found this account. I got into my post history, and surprise surprise, I find a thread from last year. I barely even remember making this post. But if you don't want to read it, generally I complained about having no friends and a girlfriend, I felt like I'm doomed to never have friends, I said I ""overcame"" social anxiety which I never did, and I felt like everyone was better than me. I wanted to quit my job back then, after only 2 weeks, because I couldn't handle the anxiety of working with others there (an anxiety I wasn't even aware of, by the way). 


I didn't quit. I kept working there. And you know what? Everything I wished for back then have come true. I made tons of friends at work. Everyone loves me there. To this day I hang around with people I'm only going to meet 8 months after making this post! That's crazy. My confidence has boosted. My self esteem has boosted. And the funniest part? I have a girlfriend. Back when I made that post, I had already met that girlfriend, I just didn't know how things are going to unfold. 


So yeah, everything I wanted was solved. And with the solutions came new problems. Life isn't always fun or good, problems just keep coming our way. I wanted friends? Good luck learning how to handle and keep friendships. I wanted a girlfriend? Oh buddy. You're going to have to tackle your worst insecurities, fears and ugly sides of yourself because you're sharing life with another person now. I wanted more confidence? That just means I'm going to get out of my comfort zone more times, and believe me, the same fear is still here.



What I'm saying is, to all of you sad mothercukers out there, the world sucks. Life sucks. I'm sad right now, the most I've ever been sad. I'm on anti depressant, go to therapy, and shit, there no solution in sight. I can't remember crying as much as I did today, ever. 

But just know. All of you sad brothers and sisters. Know that it gets better. Wether you want it or not. Wether it happens in a month, year, or 10 years. Things change for the better. If the world can turn against you, it can also turn in your favor. You just have to give it the opportunity to do so. Non of us want to get out of bed, to work out, to socialize. I know the pain my dudes. But you gotta keep doing it, because the potential for things to get better is there if you only give the world the opportunity to do so. So give yourself the opportunity to feel better. Please. It's a new year. You don't have to be happy, you don't have to feel good. Both of those are the world's job. Your job is to stay hopeful. So stay hopeful, and let life do its thing. It will definitely give back one day. I feel like fucking shit today , but  the moment I press ""submit"" I'm going to brush my teeth, drink a cup of water, and meditate for 5 minutes.

"Spent all day on the phone with my family crying. Iâm not sure I have the strength to carry on anymore. Iâve had to be âstrongâ for such a long time and I canât do it anymore.

Iâve been thinking about dying for a really long time. Multiple times a day, and after a lot of research Iâve sort of unofficially settled on hanging in the absence of a better method. 

I realized I didnât have anywhere to suspend from so thatâs been a deterrent for most of this (or I should say last) year.

But today I realized my door is high enough and sturdy enough to hang myself from and Iâve been crying all day and feeling at rock bottom so I decided to test a possible hanging rig. 

I got my scarf around my neck and tightened it to the point that my face felt swollen and I couldnât breathe. Kept it for a few seconds until my heart started to pound suddenly so I undid it.

It wasnât as unpleasant as I thought it would be. It wasnât great but it was surprisingly not as unpleasant as I had always anticipated.

Edit: also i have never shown any emotions apart from random laughs, except 2weeks ago(before xmas) i randomly bursted in to tears during our yearly trip with friends and it has haunted me ever since

"I just want to wipe my hands clean of the bare minimum responsibility for my existence. It's so fucking simple. It's very much laughable. Take my organs! Please! Lol It's more than a fair deal! Consider the alternative! It's so stupid. I'm stupid. Society's stupid. 

I don't endorse people taking their lives. This eyeblink of existence is all we have. It's literally a miracle each one of us is conscious. But for the same reason I shouldn't become waste through inaction. It's the best I can do.",5,bare minimum responsibility

"I was wondering if anyone else gets really fucking sick of people complaining about specific years and shit due to one awful thing that happened to them that year. No year will ever be perfect, each will bring bad things, so why is it that the entire population complains about specific years like they were the worst fucking thing that ever happened to them? It's hard for me to put what my thoughts are into text on this issue but basically what I'm saying is that years are just a measure of time and it's really dumb to waste your memory trying to remember which are good and which are bad.

I get really pissed around new years because all I fucking hear is people talking about how a year was amazing or shit due to fucking 3 or less events that happened during it.

Sorry for swearing a lot I know it makes me sound idiotic.",5,"g bad things, dumb to waste your memory, sound idiotic."

"The past 2 weeks were our Christmas break from school, I was more or less the same up until after Christmas...
Idk what's wrong with me, the past week has been the worst I've ever experienced, It's getting worse and I have to go back to school tomorrow...

I started feeling extremely alone for no reason, and started hugging my pillow and crying myself to sleep, two of the day of this past week I didn't sleep until at least 8 am...
After the first two nights I've started to not even turn on the lights, I've started just laying here all day trying to drown it out with tv (I've finished two, 12 episode anime in four days, and even read all of one of their manga) but it's getting to me now...

Just before writing this I felt a sudden overwhelming flow of anxiety (something I've not really ever struggled with) , and my stomach and chest feel like their more empty than ever, my head is about to explode... I'm about to cry for no reason...

I don't know what to do anymore...
It hurts so much...",5," feeling extremely alone for no reason, head is about to explode, cry for no reason, more empty, hurts"

"it feels like im whining all the time but ill just say it anyway. Is it normal to always obess over good moments that happened in the past? I always look back at times during 2015 when I was so much happier and at peace and not miserable like I am now. I always try to reread the same books, watch the same tv shows and do the same things just to get back that feeling of peace. And I fail everytime. This is stressing me out along with other issues I have. I",5,get back
