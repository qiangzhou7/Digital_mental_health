"If I wanted to describe my life in one word it would be ""confused"".  Nothing in my life makes sense, i've been searching for somewhere to belong and can't find it. I'm lost.
-Culturally I don't feel like I have any sense of national identity. I'm British but I don't feel tied to that culture or any other.
- Ethnically i'm mostly white, however slightly not ,so i've never felt at home in white society. I also notice many things about white society that are problematic.
- Sexually i'd say i'm mostly straight. I've only ever been in love with women and sexually am only interested in women for the most part. However, I do sometimes feel affection and aesthetic attraction for some men, sort of like a crush but not sexual? This is another reason why i'm lost.
- I don't like or relate to any of my family.
- I don't feel tied to religion or atheism.
- I've never been in love and can't seem to build connections with anyone.

I feel so lost. I don't feel like I have an identity. I don't belong. I've always been depressed but I have no idea why. How can I find answers?

"I'm really depressed. There's no one here to help me or to force me to get up. I've been in bed for a few days, only getting up to go to the toilet and refill my water. I haven't had any energy to make food so I've not eaten in 4 days. Just water. 

This is a particularly bad period, but even when it's better, it's still tough. I was randomly googling things like ""how to survive when you're depressed"" and one of the common pieces of advice is to be kind to yourself and accept that you're not operating at your normal capacity.

The problem is, if I'm operating only on 20% capacity, what do I do when my life is demanding at least 60%. I have so many things I haven't done. I missed a doctor's appointment yesterday, I ignored a friend's invitation today, my credit card is due to be paid in a week and even though I have the money to pay it, I just haven't yet. My fridge is completely empty aside from food that is two weeks bad. I haven't showered in 5 days. I have a massive laundry pile to do.

None of these things are unmanageable on their own, but there's just so much that I feel I can't do. How can I even begin to get help when I'm this bad? It feels like I've already reached my limit just refilling my water and going to bed.

How do I survive, in practice, when it's taking all my willpower to simply not kill myself? The guides online say to recognise the small achievements. What do you do when staying in bed and not killing yourself is an achievement? It might be admirable from some perspectives, but the world doesn't stop for chronically ill people.",5,"How do I survive, in practice, when it's taking all my willpower to simply not kill myself"
Im afraid. The suicide scale is true. Its gets progressively worse and you dont even realize it. I was at 1 contemplating death and  that was it. Now as i live i keep moving farther into the scale. Not existing is all i long for. Its all i think about. Its all i desire. Ive written 2 goodbye notes. I constantly open up the lid of pills and acting as if ill swallow them. Yesterday and today i have been making nooses with a thin belt and putting it around my neck. I squeeze so hard to simulate what its like. When i do i can feel the pressure in the top sides of my head. I can feel the rush and fear. I stopped giving a shit about everything and my attention is mainly death. Someone please comfort me.

"Throwaway account because some friends know my username and I don't want to this really getting out before I can somewhat turn it around.
For the past 5 months I have really not been the same person I used to be. I used to be a very optimistic and fun person but recently I have truly been the worst version of myself, just constantly angry and always being able to find the negative in something, I have especially have no energy to do anything. It seems my family is just too angry or disappointed in me to actually help. In this plummet I have lost a lot of friends and family members so I'm turning to reddit for any kinds of tips thoughts on how to be proactive and change this mood around for good, as I am just sick and tired of it. I keep trying to make strides out but I always seem to be falling back into this same horrible person.

I am currently a Junior in college working towards a degree I really have no interest in pursing, I know its early in my life to be stressing about careers.Every day I wake up is just a rush of anxiety that I just wish would stop. For the longest time I feel like I have been just moving from problem to problem or mistake to mistake with out any possibility of success. Every person I look to seems to either create another problem for me in their ""help"" or has no interest in helping.

As I am re reading this post I know it seems very generic, I am really just looking for anyone with some sorts of tips on how to pull myself out of this when everyone has seemed to stop giving me help so I can be happy again.",5,"just constantly angry and always being able to find the negative in something, I have especially have no energy to do anything"

"Hi all title says most of it, the other day after yet another bad experience with ladies I had a bit of a brake down. Usually it doesn't affect me, at least I thought not. The other day after being rejected by yet another women i had been talking to for a while (6 months and 2 dates). I started to have a bit of a brake down, I had to leave to pub to stop myself from doing it in front of my mates. I started to walk down the road to sit on the harbour edge (just away from the pub). Problem is as soon as I sat down I started to cry uncontrollably, I was overwellmed by negative thoughts and feeling. I felt lonely, depressed and suicidal, for a second I even just debated jumping in. It wasn't till a mate found me and claimed me down that I went back to the pub. Problem is now I can't shake these feeling I stay up late at night thinking about it, i go to places to be alone like the beach just to cry(Yes I know pathetic). I'm on dateing sites and go out to bars/clubs with mates, but I just can't seem to find a girl. I'm shy, overweight and generally just hate myself at this point in life, I have lots of friends both male and older female. They all say I'm great and things like that I'm starting to struggle to believe them. I'm 20 years old and never even kissed a girl, while all my friends get engaged, have kids and get laid. Then there's me and it's just getting a bit much atm, I just wondered if anyone else had felt this way and knows a way to deal with it? As where I'm at atm is not a good place.

"Just had the absolute worst month of my life. December has been bad for me since my grandfather passed away when I was 14 so I haven't been a big fan for a while. Just when I was starting to get past it I find out my dad has cancer, massive blood clots and on the 17th when he had me carry him to the ER so after sitting up there with him for about 12hrs until my brothers could make it I go home to catch a quick nap. When I went back later that evening my baby brother told me that the doctor only gave him two months at most. Apparently my dad had known that he had cancer for months and just chose not to tell anyone. So we all make arrangements to bring him home and have hospice help look after him until he passed. So we got him home on the 20th and me too my two brothers and my sister in law spent the night at his house. I slept in the floor beside the hospital bed in case he needed anything during the night. Since a lot of people are going to be visiting the next day I went to work as usual and visited on my lunch break and everything seemed fine. Then about an hour after I get back to work one of my brothers called and told me a nurse just came by and checked dad out and said he would be lucky to make it through the night.

"Has anyone ever felt like they didn't want to explain to their friends/family/spouse about how incredibly sad you feel. I don't know where my sadness comes from. I know I feel selfish because there are children dying of starvation and I cry alone for hours about nothing. I just don't want to explain to people how I feel. Have you ever felt so incredibly in a dark place that you feel it may be contagious. Like I feel that I am going to drain the happiness from others around me. When people ask me to tell them how I feel, sometimes I want to cry because I feel like I am going to drain their happiness with my sadness.

"I play on Playstation. The only friends I felt Iâm actually close to (save 2/3 people at my school) are on Playstation.

"I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD. For a while now, I've felt like being kind of crazy is what makes me who I am and without these feelings and behaviors, I wouldn't be me anymore. During the summer I quit taking my medications and going to therapy because I thought it was a waste of time and that it was just a way for people to control who I am. Even on meds I still felt sad and wished that I could just die quietly all the time. I stopped taking them cold turkey and withdrawals hurt like hell, but I felt like the medications that had been poisoning my mind and changing me irreparably would finally be gone. I stopped going to therapy for the same reason. 
The meds hadnât been working, but my attitude about my situation led me to spend the last six months in a really dark place and I wasn't able to study, eat much, or do basic things like get out of bed or take a shower. I kept feeding into my suicidal and self critical thoughts. At the same time, I kept thinking that I was just fake sick and the real sufferers have Schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and that I was just all bent out of shape about a minor mental illness that millions of people cope with easily every day. This made me want to be sicker so that I could feel more special or like I had more inside me to be expressed. 
I guess I was wondering two things: first, I was wondering if anyone else felt like they needed their mental illness to have worth and fed into it like I did/do and second, if anyone felt like struggling with depression makes them weak because there are worse mental illnesses.

I only answer either âyesâ or ânoâ on those days. I could have a few normal days in a row only to have them followed by a week of being afraid of everything. My eyes have been also more sensitive to light lately, if that means anything. 

In the background of all this is a strange sensation that Iâve been told by several people is only a symptom of depression. I have no emotions or interests. I donât want to talk or see anyone. Nothing in the world around me seems real, I donât recognize myself or my thoughts, and I feel as though Iâm watching myself go through the motions of life.

Itâs like my brain feels exhausted. My questions though: is this normal? How do other people deal with this if so?

The lives these ppl lead my own age traveling all around the world and I can barely make it through a day at work just to get home and collapse into my bed feeling like I just ran a marathon and then got hit by a truck because of the never ending physical nature of this disease. I had an uncle that killed himself years back and my 32 year old cousin killed him self last year. It scares me that this runs in my family especially since I can honestly say that both my uncle and cousin were doing much better than I am at my age both at least had families and were functioning, so what hope is there for me? ",5,barely make it through a day at work just to get home and collapse into my bed feeling like I just ran a marathon 
"Sorry for the very melodramatic title. The point is, i have suffered from depression and I have gotten over it about 2 years ago, but everything that goes a little downhill in my life spurs this fear that I might not be able to be ""normal"". This isn't a cry for help or anything useful at all, but I'm just writing this for personal solace. However I am interested to see if anybody who has gone through depression has this same fear of going back into the cycle.",5,"everything that goes a little downhill in my life spurs this fear that I might not be able to be ""normal"""

"Depression is so exhausting.
I used to look forward to going to sleep at night because that was my escape, finally a break. 
Now it's a time machine to anther rough day. 
I'm not trying to be a fucking poet, I just needed to put my thoughts somewhere. 
I'm just tired. 
I wish I knew what there was to do to make me feel okay again and how to get the energy to do it. ",5,just tired
"My best friend is gone. She hasn't responded in days. I haven't been able to talk to anyone else. I feel so alone. I want to say my goodbyes to everyone at some point next week. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't tell my parents about this because they usually ask me if I have a girlfriend, as a joke/nice gesture.",5, feel so alone. I want to say my goodbyes to everyone at some point 
"We are all meaningless and worthless. Our existence as a human species has destroyed the earth to an extent so far that there is no hope for repair. With everyone being greedy, selfish, and weak no one can stand for themselves. People can not be trusted with any information. There is always a way to extract that information. In the worlds history people have been tortured until they release precious information. Some information is serious and some not as important. This means that humans do not have the ability to safely store information. We are animals. We make choices free willingly. No one can be trusted because reality proves humans are sensitive weak fucks. Humans can be broken easily. Nothing but false confidence and pride allows us to live. There is no protection, no certainty or hope that cannot be broken. Im just a spectator. I could put down myself but that would be pointless. If im not feeling any satisfaction in this world then what is the point to keep living. I do not feel any attachment or love, or care. There is no satisfaction or any position energy or feelings that i feel as i wake up. Each day is a forced challenge. The world is not free. Out minds are psychologically abused and used by massive corporations. We do not have free thought. All our actions are watched and criticized. Media skews our perception of reality in the world. There is absolutely no freedom anywhere. Everyone who i look at is just following the schedule a forced schedule and routine that they are just programmed not to think any differently. Everything can change. There is no god. I donât want to put any energy into thinking about what is real and what is not. The only thing i seek is a satisfaction in life. Where something makes me feel comfortable and good or happy. This is not short term fake and false bullshit like drugs. Anyone with a working mind will realize those are bad for a number of reasons. But some people just go with what others say. Fuck that. Im not going to make people realize they are all programed and controlled robots. We are forced to do so many things. There is only one thing you can do if you realize everything is pointless and meaningless that is hope. You can hope for something but with out assurance that anything can disappear and be lost what is there to hope for. Your hope can be broken by everything around you. We are animals. Selfish greedy fucking animals. But we have our consciousness that separates us slightly from everything else in this world. But we are still animals. Which means physically we feel fear, sadness, pleasure, and lots of other feelings. It doesnât matter where we have come from we will all die. Why does it matter what we do if we will all die. Again what stops us from doing what we want can also be caused by religion. If we believe our actions affect us in another world then we will submit and obey. I donât know if there is a god but I donât care. If people understood that exact bit of words and realized that. Earth would be a complete shit show. But we have been dominated and controlled because most of us think we can not change some things about the world. Physically that is. We are fearful of physical pain and torment because those physical feelings stop us from being free. Because pain hurts. Humans are traped no one is free. This is why i want to be alone and talk to no one. Very few can understand and realize we are trapped. The way to controll humans is fear and pain but most importantly just not knowing the future and having uncertainty. No one is fearless or painless. Saying you have no feelings is a delusion of your mind. Every single living human has some sort of emotion that stops them from doing what they want. A simple example is our human physical feeling of embarrassment. Or shyness. I donât want to tel you what shyness is but embarrassing events are hard to understand why we become embarrassed. Some people become embarrassed by presenting in front of the class. Because our human bodys and minds feel embarrassment. Our body and mind are different although our body has an incrediblly strong indescribable connection to your mind. People are very dumb. Of course usain bolt is on steroids. They say the olyimpics are tested ok great. There are ways to cheat tests. At that high of a level of compitition anyone will do anything for a short term satisfaction. This satisfaction is either from the world or the persons mind. Sometimes both. Achievements in life are only in this life. They might make your mind feel good but its not eternal. Nothing is eternal. Everlasting. Everything can be broken. Safety is a false feeling. There is no real true safety. Unless i do not feel these warm feelings that I should. I donât know. Everything is cold, bitter, sad, depressing and i do not feel any satisfaction. Its depression or myself realizing that everything is a delusion and nothing is real. Im not crazy i just understand more than you. Unless my false sense of reality is also skewed to the point of no return. To where i feel no eternal warmth. There is no love that i feel. The only thing that separates my diluted mind is my physical body. I feel emotions like you. Pain, sad, happy, angry, depressed. These are what stops us from being free. The indescribable connection of our minds from our bodys. Our human bodys are what makes us want to live. Our human body is an animal. It controls our mind and our thoughts. We are all sick. Our body is irrational but our mind is rational. But our body will mess with our mind making humans the complex beings that we are. Again i feel no love or satisfaction. Everything i say and do is all from my body. Not my mind. My body controls my mind most of the time. I donât feel like i can control my body in a way where it will not affect my mind. Since we have a conciousness we are not gods. Since i have no satisfaction I donât want to live but my physical body affects my mind from ending it all. Maybe there is another realm, world, hell or heaven. Who knows. The uncertainty controlls us. We have freedom to sone dregree. Yes our free choices are the smallest most insignificant thing in this world. There is no attachment to anything. Why do i know all of this and feel that way i do. I do not know. I might be missing something. I am missing something its most likely comfort. Not physical comfort but the uncertainty in my mind. Uncertainty is why humans are fearing the future. Its cold dark and what is reality. What is a conciousness. There is no such thing as safety. Uncertainty and us as humans not knowing what the future holds alows religion to control us. Religion is based and controls you with out your thought because you are uncertain. No one knows the future thats what makes churches and religion wealthy and powerful. Because if you make someone hope for something good in the future then you can control them. Our unknowingness allows people to control us. Someone who we think is in authority can control us because of our uncertainty so they tell us what we want to hear. But this is a tool to control the masses. I know so much i have so much to share but my body stops me sometimes. Why do we follow what people say? Because the world has punishments for you. If you did not feel anything physically you would rule this fucking earth. Simple as that. People stop being so dumb. Many people are sheep they just follow. And it is not possible not to follow. Im loosing my thought process as my body physically drifts off to rest",5,Humans can be broken easily

"Whenever Iâm not 100% distracted, I end up thinking about my mood, and at this point, I will automatically tell myself and reinforce that I am in fact depressed and not truly having fun, even if it is questionable. I canât even tell if Iâm having fun. Itâs like if Iâm enjoying myself heaps, like laughing with friends or watching cute animals, and realise that Iâm having fun, and that thought triggers myself to say to myself that I will never be happy and this is a fleeting moment, and that thought itself acts as âevidence that Iâm depressedâ which goes back into the cycle of negativity which de-purifies whatever enjoyment Iâm feeling. Plus, I honestly donât remember what true happiness or pleasure feels like, like what am I looking for to know theyâre working?",5,"will never be happy and this is a fleeting moment, and that thought itself acts as âevidence that Iâm depressed"
"Do you feel different? Do you feel like they change you? Do they help? Iâm asking because after years of refusing medication because I felt like I could beat depression on my own, Iâve reached a point where Iâm scared of my state of mind and that I need medication. Any advice would be greatly appreciated",5,cared of my state of mind and that I need medication
"i don't know what else to say. it's 12am, im hungry but too scared to eat, full of self hate and want to cry but can't. anytime i try and close my eyes all i do is think and i want to stop thinking but i can't.",5,full of self hate and want to cry but can't
"Iâve lived with depression for so long that it feels weird not to be depressed sometimes. I donât like it. Itâs almost as if I need my depression because itâs what Iâm comfortable with. It gets me through my ruts in life by making me feel nothing. But at the same time, itâs so pathetic. It keeps me from doing things I enjoy, and it makes me feel worthless and hopeless. It makes me think about suicide a lot too because I start to think about my future, like what the point is in living or if I can really handle anymore pain. (What is the point in life anyway? Work until you die?) But then it gets even worse when I realize I canât end it, because of personal obligations based on relationships and religion. (Plus Iâd never get to finish dark souls. But really whatâs it matter when youâre so depressed that you canât even turn your console on).",5,ets me through my ruts in life by making me feel nothing
