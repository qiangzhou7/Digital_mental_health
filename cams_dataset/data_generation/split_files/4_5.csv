Want to pick out a recipe each week and we'll try it? My therapist reminded me that baking helped me out of my last large bout of depression so I figured I'd try it again. I made lace cookies last week and going to make cheese crackers today.,4,baking 
"From what I've seen, people suffering from depression feel down even though things around them are somewhat okay. As for me, I just got divorced, my ex-wife is an incredibly manipulative narcissist, and we have a young child together. She's accused me of horrible things that I would never do in a failed attempt at full custody. I'm constantly battling her over our child. In the past she has successfully isolated and controlled me through guilt and accusations. She almost succeeded in manipulating the courts. The legal fees appear to be leaving me bankrupt. My thoughts are full of her, her constant false accusations and how to defend against them. I'm on a tenure track at a university, but that job is f-ed now because I can't concentrate on my research for longer than 5 minutes. So yeah, I'm kind of feeling down. My ex is abusive and is so good at it that the legal system and even women's abuse counselors will back her and protect her. I'm in therapy. Started going to church. Prayer helps me get back to sleep now. Trying to cut down on drinking. Exercising a lot. Still can't focus on work, so I'm now focusing on how to change careers and stay in the same area (close to our child.) What should I do? Am I suffering from depression? When this abuse and false accusations first started a few years ago, I thought about wanting to die. My career is f-ed now because of this. That makes me worry about future custody battles. In the meantime should I ask my therapist about depression medication? What's going on with me? Please help.",4,"bankrupt, divorced, isolated"
"I want to talk to somebody but don't know how. I yearn for some decent human connection, yet I don't know how to connect. I have friends. But most of them either don't have time for me, or don't care for me as much as I care for them, are bored with me or are boring to me. I won't to make new friends, meet new people. But it's not just hard, it seems next to impossible. I know a few places where I can meet people that I find interesting, but there are several but's. One of those places is a sort of a board game parlour. But that's one place. And I'm afraid that if I screw that up I won't be able to come there no more, or I'll have to avoid certain people. I feel like I might lose those opportunities and be left with no opportunities. And that scares me. I'm scared of being hopeless again. Because it's awful to have no hope and know you'll never have any glimmer of hope again. If only I had a group of best friends I could rely on, sort of a safe net, someone that's always there. But there are no people like that in my life. Let's say friends are coffee mugs and my life is a table. Most of the coffee mugs are near the edge, some are even halfway over the edge, always in danger of falling over, all it takes is one false move. Talking to someone new is like putting a new mug right on the edge, half on the table, half over the edge. It's fucking nuts. I can't take those risks, I suck, I know, but I can't. I'm not very interesting (at first at least) or articulate and a lot of people find that annoying. Even talking to people on social networks is scary. I just hate that sound of a ceramic mug  breaking on the hard floor. Most people do I think. When something beautiful full of possibilities breaks. I feel like every meaningful and real conversation that I've ever had happened by mistake, by accident, with little involvement from me. And now I'm all out of happy accidents, and haven't learnt how to make those conversation happen on my own. I'm 24, virgin, never been kissed. I feel alone with no direction at life.",4,"breaks,lose those oppurtunies."

"Hi, everyone. I thank you in advance for reading this post. 

I feel trapped, I don't know what to do. Today I realized the fact of no longer having a family. My mom has a really rare type of cancer, my dad abandoned us when I was 1 year old, so I don't know anything about him. 

I haven't graduated college yet, I work to sustain myself, pay rent and food, while trying to finish my career and get my degree. But, my extended relatives who used to support me financially (since my mom never did it) insulted me for not spengind New Year's Eve with them. I got to live in another city because of my studies, and I am glad because I don't live with them anymore. 

I didn't do it for the sake of my mental health, I constantly get verbally and physically abused by those relatives and that has been like that since I was born. My aunt even tried to kill me. 
They didn't care about my depression, anxiety or suicide attempts. 
Depression started for me since I was 12, today I am 22. I have battling with disease alone, no meds, got therapy just twice because I couldn't afford more, but still they say I have no right to complain since ""they had horrible childhoods and I didn't have to sell anything on the streets"". 

I am really scared because I am afraid of losing my job and I don't want them to hurt me. I don't know what to do if I lose my job, I don't have close friends and my boyfriend is poor and still lives with his parents 

Any advice or opinion? I need help. Thank you. :) ",4,"verbally and physically abused, haven't graduated yet, abandoned,horrible childhood"
"It doesn't matter who does or does not see this, at this point. I just want to get it off my chest. This isn't a success story. This isn't uplifting. I am a broken man who couldn't fix myself, even a little bit. I lost the person I love, and I have nothing else. All I want right now is people to talk to, people I can pretend are friends. All I want is to die or have my love back, and I can't have either. Don't be like me.


This is a direct continuation of the last part. My therapist and I were still getting to know one another and were communicating primarily through messages, as I wasn't really comfortable with more. Once we began having actual sessions, there will be bits and pieces missing that I really can't account for too well.



&gt;  Hello ///// - Thank you for openly sharing your views about yourself, your beliefs and the relational history and status with your siblings. This could not have been easy, yet you did it. I wonder if the traumatic experiences you had made survival possible only if you were able to believe that you didn't matter. It's interesting because the very thing that you want to be able to give your partner is locked away even from you. I also wonder if doing things for the benefit of others is protective for you because it keeps you from expecting anything, thus never again being let down.

&gt; ///// - I know that you talked about not having faith in yourself or believing in yourself, because if you did you would have done ""more than you have"". Your honesty and the truth as you see it is welcomed and valued in this space. Have you ever had the experience of losing something, beginning to look for it and then finding something else that was previously lost? Perhaps this is what will occur for you on this journey. It doesn't matter WHY you are here , only that YOU ARE and that you are WILLING to consider multiple perspectives on what may be going on inside of you that is impacting your symptoms, relationships and view of self. I have a suspicion that you are actually willing , you just need a good, sturdy, yet flexible and toxic free bridge to hope. This IS your time /////. This may be what you have been waiting for all of your life. Remember, the journey of a thousand miles, begins with ONE step.

*Hello, //////.*

*I don't know about it not being easy. For the people I actually trust, it is easy to divulge basically every thing. For those I don't, they will never know me. But I understand that it is vital to this particular relationship to forgo any subterfuge. If I had mattered to those who wronged me, they would not have done so. If I had mattered to myself, I would not have let those things happen. To say I was a child and knew no better stopped being a legitimate excuse when I turned 18. After that point, it's just been me fucking up without excuse. I know better, and I still keep fucking up. I don't know how to break myself from the cycle.*

*I don't know if I agree with that last bit, because, even though my interest or intent may not be for my own benefit, I do expect to occasionally result in theirs. To make them happier, to make their life better, to earn a place in it. I have never been successful in the end. That is a crippling kind of failure, feeling let down is an understatement. I am, each and every time. When it comes to my partners, there's nothing I don't try to give, nothing I'm not willing to do. And yet it always seems that I don't actually commit to that, I always let THEM down. And then myself when that relationship crumbles. It is no less devastating each time it happens.*

*I... Don't really know if I'd had that particular experience, no. I don't think I've ever really been 'looking' for anything, besides a relationship I can count on. I have stumbled blindly into and out of every relationship, every hobby or interest, every place I've ever been. I have never had a plan. I have always just winged it and saw how it turned out. The answer is, never really any good.*

*I believe that to say you want something is fine, but to not follow up is proof that you do not actually want that thing. To say, ""I wanna go there"" and then NOT go there makes you a liar. If you really wanted it, wouldn't you have done it? If I really wanted to be in better shape, wouldn't I have done it by now? No, I just don't want to do it badly enough. This is the first and only time I've tried to follow through, and even then, I do not think it may actually benefit my current reason to do so. I think I may have damaged my relationship to the point it cannot be fixed.*

*I'm more than open to other perspectives. For what it's worth, I know you're not wrong. I know the things you're saying are true. At least, the locked away part. The believing in myself, waiting for my time. I know you're not wrong in those things. I just can't believe in them, myself. I wish I could, but something keeps me from doing it. All that cliche crap about ""where there's a will there's a way"" and never giving up, some part of me really wants to believe it because I know it's a way out of this. I just don't know how to do that.*

*I tend to ramble, by the way.*

"Here is how pathetic I am. I am a 35 year old man (though I use that term loosely as I am pretty much a shitty example of one) and I have to post my problems to Reddit because I have no where else to turn to. I'll  give you the highlights. 

I have no friends and have always been the guy in the periphery of groups of friends. 

I was miserable in high school, probably had add or somethign. I was miserable in college and went to a shitty open enrollment commuter shool. 

I'm college I got my gf pregnant after dating her for two months.  She only wanted to work part time as a cashier despite the fact she has a nursing degree. I wanted to get my PhD as I was a liberal arts major and that was the only way to get a job. But I had to quit  that as I had to work two jobs (one full time) to support my new family. 

My only child doesn't even have my last name as my in laws have, over the last decade, tried to convince my wife I am going to walk out on the family. I have always sacrificed everything for them.

Despite a decade of working my ass off and sleepless nights I make less than 50k a year.


My wife developed depression and anxiety and was suicidal, she is now on meds. 

My wife also is infertile and we can never have more children, she also can't be intimate as she no longer produces mucous. I haven't had sex in three years and unless I have an affair (like that would even happen...... I'm too much of a loser for any woman to want that) I will never have sex again. 

My child has depression, anxiety, adhd,. He has been kicked out of one school already. Keeping him stable is a daily grind. I also missed most of the childhood moments working all those jobs and trying to do grad school. 

I drive a 13 year old car that just broke down for the third time this winter. 

My father has had several strokes and is 100% bed ridden, I have to help my elderly mother help him daily before I go into my low paying low prestige job. 

I no longer have my youth. 

I had less than $12k to my name. 

The only thing that made life bearable was drinking alone to just make stuff numb. I feel like I want to just give up and do that from here on out. Life is fucking shit, especially compared to where my peers are at in their lives. What is the fuking point. I am a loser in a very way imaginable

"So I've had a rough set of years, probably close to 6 now. Early on I lost loads of weight, lost myself in darkness and music, never had lights on, stayed in my room nearly all the time, slept a tonne and just isolated myself.

I've spoken to people (professionally etc) and tried pills (which I hated and stopped very fast) and I've been forced to hospitalize myself, had a psychosis evaluation, spent hours on the phone with samaritans, heard voices, panic attacks, paranoia, nearly went for CBT, been down a huge road of referrals, sliced and burnt myself, suicidal thoughts invade my head 24/7, lost all my friends, my anxiety hit the roof. Blah blah blah you all know the drill

Over time I have been getting better, little things change and slowly I feel better in myself 

These past few weeks though man I've just felt so okay, not upset at all, no telling myself to throw myself off a bridge, no urge to harm myself (how awfully embarrassing) and just generally been smiling a bit more

Thing is I don't want to feel better I think..? Now I have no reason to be my boring as fuck self. That's just who I am, a boring lonley gross waste of space. You know when you can feel a massive load of tears just behind your face waiting to come out at any second? I've had that for a while now, both a mixture of happiness and sadness

My parents and boyfriend push me to keep going and to try everyday to be happy but I just canât fucking do it anymore. They donât understand how hard it is. I just want it to go away. I donât want to study and have a good job, I donât want to live. No life will ever make up for the pain I feel.

"Hi, I am a 19 year old man, so I am still a teenager who probably understands very little about life. Even so, lately I have felt terribly depressed for the reasons I will make known a little later. Before, I used to be a very happy person, I had a girlfriend with whom we were about to be 3 years together. She was also my best friend, we did everything together and she did not need anyone else (besides, i did not have anyone else, but that did not matter to me, while she stands with me, i didn't need any friends). The thing is that at one point we broke, at first I was very affectionate, but I ""got over it"" quickly and I felt pretty good. The problems came when I realized that I did not know how to relate to almost anyone, I did not know who to turn to constantly as a friend, not as an acquaintance whom I only see at some parties. At first I did not take much importance, because despite not having friends, I used to go out at night quite often with different people. I went from group to group, everything was super intermittent, I did not stay with anyone constantly because I was not sure how to do it. Then, I reached a point where I started to get depressed slightly from time to time, like when I was alone in my house or went out to do everyday tasks, the fact of being alone and realizing it depressed me . Although I felt bad, it was not something that happened to me often (About 3 days a week more or less), but with time it became constant, I began to despair because I did not have anyone by my side. I tryed to make friends , but they all went away in the passing of days. So, I also began to feel as if people hated me, as if nobody wanted me and preferred to get away from me, as if I were a bloodthirsty. At this moment I do not know what to do, I have many suicidal thoughts, I do not want to get up in the mornings, I do not even go out, I stay in my house locked up doing nothing. The thing is that I do not know how to make friends, and that's killing me, loneliness is getting worse. I've really tried a lot of ways to make friends, but they all end up leaving me and that only makes things worse as I said before. I want to ask for your help, I want to know how you can make friends (Because i really have no idea how to), how to avoid this loneliness, how I want to go out and stop thinking about committing suicide, but most importatly, how to make friends, i feel like that's all i need.

People swear they are there for you. They say ""I'm here for you if you ever need me!"" but then when you need them, they don't answer your calls, they don't answer your messages, they blatantly ignore you. It takes back all the sincerity of the gesture to be there for you..

I've thought about my own suicide more than once. Actually saying more than once is a bit of an understatement. I think of it every day. Many times a day. When I wake up in the morning, when I get into the shower (if I feel well enough to take one), when I walk outside, while I'm driving.. suicide is a constant thought in my life.

I know exactly how it would go too.. 

1. People would say they never saw it coming.
Oh, really? You never saw it coming? You didn't see my posts on facebook about how lonely I was? You never saw me asking if anyone wanted to hang out? You never saw my poetry that I posted about depression and my dark thoughts? You don't remember all the times I swallowed pills or tried to hang myself and had to be hospitalized? Is that all a blur to you?

2. People will post comments on my social media about how close we were, how much this hurts them... but truth is, they only do it for the likes. I can honestly tell you that I have 2 friends. I'm not kidding. 2. And anyone who says they miss me and love me or that they were there for me.. Its all a lie. People become so fake when someone commits suicide.
They take the death of someone and turn it into something that will give them social media fame, likes, comments. They're addicted to the attention and no regard to the life that has been taken by dark thoughts. 

3. No one will talk about the suicide part. Oh, it's just too sad. It's just too soon. They never want to acknowledge that suicide is REAL. 

4. They will forget me. After all the social media comments and all the posts saying ""RIP Angel"".. a few months will go by,maybe a year or two and then all of a sudden, I'm just a name. A name on a list of those that lost it. They finally reached the breaking point.

I'm writing this in case anyone tries to say that they loved me or that they were there for me.. because if they did, if they REALLY loved me, I would get a reply. I wouldn't be sitting on the bathroom floor crying my eyes out. They would answer their phone. I would have someone to talk to. But right now as I write this, I am alone. I don't matter to a soul now and I won't when I'm gone either. After a few years I will eventually be completely forgotten.

"I have decided to do myself a favour and clean my room. 
These past years have not been very good to me. 

Towards the beginning of the month I moved into this room.
My best friend hasn't talked to me since I moved out from where she lives.
My shrink hasn't talked to me in 2~ weeks even though I've been trying to set up an appointment with her.
I tripped acid on the 26th and basically was in a state of panic for 24~ hours and got taken advantage of by my sisters friends (my sister is a good person, but often doesn't see the bad in people).

It's been rough but I at least owe myself this one thing. 
Sorry if this sounds like a pity party for myself but I just wanted to try and have someone that I need to report to. That seems to be the only way that I can get anything that I want to do done is if there is pressure on me. It's the only reason I applied for my last job.

"Prepare for a long read: 

Im only 15 years old so in comparison to most of you i probably have had it easy but i just need to tell my story for some advice because ive been feeling like shit. So lets start off with my past; my parents got divorced when i was 4 years old than my mother got married to another woman and my father also got married again. I went to my fathers house every weekend so i didnt really miss him but when the years went on that changed into 3 hours a week and i really hated the fact i couldnt really be around him. Then in the following 5 years my grandparents died which ofcourse sucked but i never really cried and just put all the emotions aside. When i was 10 my mother woke me up, she was crying and told me that my father killed himself lastnight. He called the day before but i didnt get to speak to him because i was playing in the garden with a friend and whatever i would go to him 2 days later. I cried for probably 5 minutes and then again i put aside my emotions. Also at his funeral i barely cried and it felt terrible but i just wasnt able to cry. Since that day everything went downhill and ive never really been happy. My mother told us that she felt like a man and she got an operation and now looks like a man as well. She and my stepmother than used a spermdonor to get my stepmom pregnant and i got a little sister at the age of 12. I never really talk with anyone about my situation so everyone just assumes that my mother is my dad and my stepmom my mother and ofcourse i cant blame them. Im a very shy, anxious and introvert person. I also aint that good looking but im very smart (i skipped a year and follow the highest possible level of education) and a lot of people say im funny so thats the only thing im confident about. I used to have some really good friends and as a group we were pretty close but then i skipped the year and went to a different class and the contact just stopped and i was alone. Looking back i think skipping the year was one of the things that fucked me up big time because i went from multiple good friends to no friends at all. I never got out of the house and never really talked with anyone. Then i went to high school(idk what its called but you go there when youre +-12 y/o) and one guy of my old class went to that school aswell so we kinda became friends but that died of really fast aswell. Since im pretty ugly and shy there has never really been a girl in my live that really talked to me or cared about me. But 1.5 years ago this girl from school randomly started to text me and it didnt take long till i got feelings for her we went on texting and talking for months and got really close. But eventhough a lot of people told me she liked me i couldnt believe that anyone would ever love me especially since and i never asked her out ot told her how i felt. She isnt really the best looking girl so i didnt really have any competition but she is still far out of my range. I dont want to talk about her too much so i just will sumarise it; went to her sweet 16 where i got drunk, knocked the fuck out and left out of shame in the night. We got close again months later i (unplanned )told her that i always liked her on fucking snapchat and she said she had to think about it. She never answered and im trying to move on and focus on school and work. But i just cant i miss the one friend i always talked to about how i felt and that was always there for me now she just ignored me and broke my heart in pieces. With the stress of school i was already feeling like shit and im really lacking sleep which is making it even worse. Not being able to talk about my emotions with her or anyone else really makes everything worse and my marks and mood are going downwards very fast. I would tell my mother but she has her own problems which she already barleycan handle so that aint an option and i really hate my stepmother so not even gonna bother trying. Especially the last weeks have been tough with last grandmother dying aswell. I didnt even cry when i heard it again i put the emotions aside and now its becoming too much. Christmas and new years eve were terrible and lonely for me since i didnt get invited to anything. Ive really been considering suicide that last few years but those thoughts became more serious last months. Im gonna break sooner or later and then everything will come out and i know it can be the end of me. The last days ive been wondering why i am alive and what my purpose is on this world and if anyone would really miss me when im gone. Any advice on who i can talk about? or how i maybe will feel better? or let the emotions out?",4," parents got divorced, mother got married to another woman, grandparents died, father killed himself, very shy, anxious and introvert, no friends, let the emotions out ,terrible, lonely"
"I has become too unbearable keeping my feelings in. I told my day one friends. They were friends from back in my old town that I have pushed away. They all responded with open arms, I didnât feel so alone. They have told me that they care about me, I told them through text, so I didnât get a real hug. But I was able to cry and let it all out knowing that my friends still have my back and Iâm not alone after all. ",4,not alone

So my ex and I were dating for a while. 2 years this April. Throughout the relationship we both âflirtedâ with other people but never physically cheated. For the past couple months it wasnât working and we mutually decided to call it off New Yearâs Eve. Being in so much pain last night I slept with someone else hoping it would help at least sone of the pain. It didnât. My ex and I spoke on the phone after it while I was driving home and agreed on whatever happened while we were single happened and wanted to talk after a few weeks and maybe give us another shot. The anxiety took over and I told her I slept with someone else and hearing her cry like that broke me even more. She told me thereâs no chance now weâre ever getting back together and itâs done for good. Does she really mean it or is she saying it because sheâs hurt? ,4,"Throughout the relationship we both âflirtedâ with other people but never physically cheated, done for good,"

"All my life Iâve been boring, pathetic, awkward and socially incompetent. Iâm so fucking sick of being the outcast in every situation and just that weird quiet girl. Itâs not like I donât have friends, but thereâs always seemed to be a limit to the extent I can connect with someone. I always end up overthinking every little interaction I have with someone to the point where I fuck it up more than I wouldâve if I had just been myself. And over the years Iâve gotten so caught up in trying to be perfect that eventually Iâve forgotten how to just be me. 

Recently Iâve been talking to some people in my year on instagram. And I guess I developed a sort of âfriendship crushâ on them. They seemed so interesting and they shared and appreciated my outlook. I never really thought Iâd meet someone with the same interests and opinions as me until I started talking to them. 
Something happened today which fucked everything up. They posted a picture of them at a party and I guessed I just realised no matter how much I THINK Iâm connecting with them, thereâs no way of our friendship advancing. Iâve always been an outcast and I always will be and theyâre just as shallow as any of the other popular kids. No matter how much hope I have for finally relating to someone, most likely situation is that itâs all in my head and theyâre just laughing about me behind my back.
Iâm probably hugely over-thinking this but I canât get it out of my head and itâs tearing me apart. I still want to be friends with them but I guess Iâm just realising any hope I had was just pathetic me being oblivious to the fact that they donât have any interest in me. 
I guess I just needed to get that out. ",4,"posted a picture of them at a party, outcast, boring, pathetic, awkward, socially incompetent"
"My boyfriend of 3 years and I broke up. My first love, my universe, my everything. 
He messaged me on Christmas telling me he still loves me. I told him I loved him too. We met up yesterday for the first time in a couple months. We kissed a bit, my feelings came back more, even though they never really left, and he told me he misses me so much, he looks at pictures of us everyday. That he still wants to marry me one day. Be the father of my children. I say I want this one day too. And that even though I know we're not right for a relationship right now, I love him and we'll still hang out together since he works close to me. He agreed to come back today to see me. He promised. 
I let myself get excited, I waited, I called, he didn't call back. I called him later wondering what was going on, and he says
 ""I'm fucking other girls and they don't need to know I'm talking to you.""
And here I am thinking about us together, waiting for a call, waiting for him to come since I woke up this morning; and that's what he's doing. 
You can think about someone every waking moment and care about them more than anything in the world, and they will shit on you. And crush your soul. And the whole time it could be lies and bullshit, and your feelings could be so real, but the universe is cruel and unforgiving like that. 
The one person I care about more than anybody doesn't give a shit about me. 
He fed me bullshit this whole time. 
And I've been sitting my phone staring at the time waiting for him to call, and his dick is currently in other girls. 
And I don't really know what to do with myself. 
Happy New Years to me. ",4,"broke up, first love, my universe, my everything "
"Ok so I'm not gonna lie, I'm drunk, its New Year's day, and I have had a lot of time to self reflect lately. I've been off work from a bulging disc injury (I'm an STNA)and one of the biggest things that helps me fight my depression is working.
I've had waaaayyy too much time to just think and dwell on things that don't necessarily have to be resolved but closure would be nice. 
One of which is, I'm the baby of the family...and I fear that I was babied so much that I was never actually punished or told what was right and what was wrong. I feel like my parents just didn't care anymore at that point because my first 3 sisters were exhausting. They just appeased me. Or tried too. 
The second is...was/is my perception of reality messed up, in more ways than I care to type out right now...or is am I just a brat that never learned her lessons...how the hell do I deal with it either way?

TLDR:I feel like since I'm the baby of the family I was babied and wasn't taught the basics and principals of life. Now I'm just treading water till I feel like giving up.",4,"parents just didn't care anymore, drunk, self reflect"

"I've never considered I could be depressed, until very recently after speaking to a friend about her depression. 

For most of most of my life, from a teen to 33, I've had bouts of utter sadness/despair where I feel like I'm not good enough or ever will be. 

But it was always in small doses and usually I could be cheered up fairly easily. What helped a lot was looking forward to watching sports, videogames, nice food and time with close friends. It helped, it always helped, but it was fleeting.

Today at 33, I'm married to a gorgeous and wonderful woman. She really is a beauty, and everyone assumes she's a  trophy wife, except for that fact she's an engineer and has a very popular blog.  We have a wonderful flat, envy of many of our friends. We've got adorable dogs.

Our social life is ok, not great (we've moved to a new city and lost touch gradually with old friends), but we're both sociable and usually never spend a week without a social activity with friends. 

I've got a decent career and make twice what someone my age usually gets. My wife and I together earn just over Â£150K/year before taxes.

We travel a lot, workout a lot, eat healthily, socialize, sleep fairly well (at least 7 hours most nights)..........but that crippling sadness still lingers in me.

I find myself sad and withdrawn a lot for no specific reason. 

It's especially bad when I come back to my home country for Christmas and I see everyone I used to be close to seeming so happy and content without a care about me.

Right now, I'm particularly down about how one of my friends has been toward me. I got him a one of kind (took some effort to find it too, had to get in contact with the band's tour manager) amazing item from his favorite band. We weren't able to meet before Christmas, but today I saw him and he opened the gift and showed little to know appreciation, barely looked at it and then was on his phone 90% of the time, barely asked anything about me or my life. Then left in a hurry saying one his friends wanted to catch a movie with him and he didn't wanna be late.

Now that's a specific reason to be sad, but I've been very down recently and maybe it is my self esteem that's low too, but seeing how not just him, but so many people that I thought were important to me, have just ignored me. It hurts.

I didn't mean to rant, it's just my lingering sadness is getting worse.

I'm afraid to tell my wife, she's had mental health issues and is finally getting better and I don't want to set her back or burden her.

My best friend, the one who opened up to me about her depression, is my confidant right now and she is helping tremendously. Just knowing she understands helps. 

Does anything really fix this though? i just want to feel carefree and not sad/worried/anxious all the time.",4,"ignored me, hurt, bouts of utter sadness, despair, not good enough, sad, withdrawn a lot for no specific reason,  "

"I spent another birthday alone. My 30th. Not that it makes much of a differences since I have spent most days of my life alone. Not even posting in r/viriginityexchange at the last minute in the hopes of a pity fuck worked.

I am unable to pass whatever social filter that allows for normal sexual interactions.

I have laid next to two women naked in their respective beds. Neither time did I believe they were genuinely attracted to me and I am still not sure they were. I missed those opportunities to lose my virginity many years ago. Since then I have become uglier, fatter, and bald. I am so bitter and negative there is no way I will seem attractive to anyone, least of all myself.


I could blame with the conservative and severely orthodox Catholicism that taught me to hate myself and my own sexual urges. Still recovering from this. I could blame the terrible role models of relationships in my life since my parent's and family's' relationships look like stories written by Updike. I could blame my own past. Regrettably, I have to blame my own cowardice. My own hatred of myself  poisoning my veins resulting in endless pity parties and destructive hedonism. 

It doesn't matter what the causes are now. It is too late. If I ever got up the courage to ask someone on a date and by some miracle they agreed, the actual road to sexual or affectionate behavior would be so pitiful and pathetic she would doubtlessly be turned off or just laugh at my inexperience.

I am going to die a virgin and alone. Whether that death is natural or by my own actions I don't know. It won't be today or tomorrow, but the loss of having missed out on so much is unbearable. I am missing out on the essential human connections that our stories, songs, movies, and every aspect of human culture scream as being the most important part of our humanity. I will never what it like to be loved by another human or experience sexual joy.

"I hate it when my mom compares me to my cousin saying âCJ never stress his mom out, but you stress me outâ... when Iâm trying my ass off to not stress my mom out, to the point where I want to grab a bottle of pills and chug it down my throat and itâs sucks to think about that. 
",4,"mom compares me to my cousin, you stress me, trying my ass off not stress my mom out"
"My depression comes and goes, for the most part I'm content and happy, I just have a bad day here and there, but that hasn't been the case over the past month or so. I've gotten drunk almost everyday the past few weeks (although I am sober writing this and have no plans to drink tonight,) I've been overeating, and I've cut back on my workouts which has caused me to put on a little weight (although I guess that's pretty normal for people around the hollidays.) 

I've also been overagrresive and snap on the littlest dumb things. I've been destroying my house, putting holes in the wall and kicking doors and cabinets. I've also been waking up in my sleep pissed off from a dream and hitting the wall. I even woke up and headbutted the wall two times in a row which makes me feel like an absolute crazy person.

This kind of behavior is absolutely not fair to my best friend who is always there for me, my dog. It scares the shit out of him, and he doesn't know how to react. It really makes me feel like shit.

The forefront of my depression I think is due to the fact that I'm lonely. I have a good close group of friends, but most of them live hours away, so were just not able to hangout too often. It just sucks having no one to hangout with in my off time. Im also longing for companionship, a relationship, just someone to be with in a romantic manor. Ideally I'd like something serious with a girl. I do get to hangout with a girl every blue moon, and I'm usually elated afterwards and feel happy, but then it goes nowhere which makes me come down pretty hard.

Which as I'm writing this I'm realizing that may be why I'm in this slump. I met this cool girl, we hungout and had a good time, and I let my hopes get up because I thought I might actually have a chance of something happening with her. But in the end it was obvious that she just wasn't that into me. Which is ok, I'm over it, looking back and getting to know her a bit more I realize that we wouldn't have been a good match. I just wish I could find girls to go out with more than once every 6 months.

I'm just really lonely, I want someone to be with so bad. Someone that I can come home to and spend time with, and cuddle, and have sex of course, but all the other stuff is so much better for me. Of course, I know I have deeper seated issues than just loneliness. I also wish I would have accomplished more in life in general by now, being 27 yrs old, but I'm not gonna get into all that.

I'm not suicidal, although I do think about it everyday, and do wonder if it would be easier to just end it all. But there's no way I could go through with it right now. I love my friends, family, and my dog too much and know it would destroy them if I was gone. I do talk about this stuff with my friends and I'm pretty open with them as far as everything I've written here. So I do have a decent support system, but there's only so much they can do.

That being said, I'm not really asking for advice, I know what I need to do to get better and I recognize my problems. I just wanted to put it all into words to see if it made me feel better, and I think it did. Here's too a better year and getting my shit together.

"When I was severely depressed, my therapist recommended using distraction to prevent myself from being consumed by flashbacks of former trauma.

"NOTE: I used this Instagram account to post a meme, and did not assume the identity of anyone else nor did I use any photos of people.

I have an interest in this guy, so I decided to follow his Instagram with a fake meme account one I made. I don't know why I didn't make a real one in retrospect, but I'm not going to take the chance of making a second one with my true identity because that would look even more suspicious, right?

I see why I stay away from social media. I made a decision that probably made him view me as a creep.

I created an instagram account, and tried to post some jokes, because I wanted him to think I was funny. It was my attempt at communication, under disguise. It was stupid in retrospect and I won't ever do it again. But honestly, I want to know what I can do to fix this, because I don't want him to view me in a weird way.

I think that people who are depressed can be grouped into two general categories. Those who have been unfortunately mentally wired wrong and those who have experienced some awful trauma or emotional pain. I'm sure for many on this sub it is both. For me it is both. And because of this fact I am uncertain if I can ever recover. I feel as though it is inevitable that I will kill myself. There is a part of me that really doesn't want to; i'm scared. But there are also times that I feel so badly and I just want it to end. Has anyone out there found anything that's helped them?

"I've been depressed for about 7 years now starting when I was 13.

I want so badly to kill myself. I am so depressed. I feel empty and hopeless and now I can't kill myself because people are actually relying on me now. 

I'm kind of just babbling but this is the only place I feel safe to be honest because I don't want people to treat me like a ticking time bomb. 

Last night (NYE) I got too drunk at a work party and made an ass of myself. I feel like a different person takes over sometimes and makes me feel suicidal and just generally puts me in bad situations in which I make messes upon messes. I look at myself in the mirror and don't even recognize the reflection as my own. I have to consciously fight to remember that I'm real. I get in my head a lot about how everything is subjective and nothing is real and it makes me feel so overwhelmed I could just drop dead.

I feel like I live in a sarcophagus; my face and body is the fancy lid, but inside there's this entire other existence trapped and unable to control anything that happens on the outside. 

I spend so much energy just keeping myself from killing myself that I don't have enough juice to have any sort of discipline. Then when I act without discipline, I feel so guilty and ashamed and it makes me want to kill myself more. 

I've tried to talk to therapists and all of that but no one seems to get it. They just nod their head and tell me it will get better. It hasn't. And it probably won't. I think I am just destined to be sad and eventually kill myself. My depression is so enmeshed in my identity (remember it's been around for most of my emotional development) that I don't even know anything about myself outside of it. It's strange to me that most people to whom I speak about it aren't depressed. It's so normal to me that I am actually shocked by people who don't live in constant despair and darkness. Hmm. Anyway.",4," ass of myself, feel suicidal, hurting people who care about me, badly to kill myself, feel empty and hopeless"
