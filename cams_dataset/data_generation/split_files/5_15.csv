"Now an again I feel so alone, empty and that I have nothing going for me. I use to go out with friends every weekend, play sports etc but now I spend 99% of my life inside and do nothing.

A year plus ago my doctor put me down for anxiety and gave me some pills and i felt ok after awhile but lately I just feel the same. This time I don't feel the self harming will be enough.  

I make excuses when friends want to do something as i just don't want to go outside. There are all off having familys and i'm here doing nothing. Ive been seeing the doctor recently for passing blood and apart of me wants it to be something serious. 

I found some of my olds pills and i'm just going to see where the night goes....",5,"I feel so alone, empty and that I have nothing going for me, I spend 99% of my life inside and do nothig"
"I've never really posted in anything like this but I have nobody in my life I can or want to talk too and I'm sitting in my room by myself on New Year's at midnight occasional tearing up every 10 minutes or so feeling so incredibly lost and alone. I feel like the last year of my life has been trying to look for a reason to keep going everyday and I still haven't found one, I feel like I'm just waiting till I just break and take my own life... I barely see my friends once a month now and when I'm with them I feel so out of place and awkward. most of my ""friends"" are in Nottingham tonight celebrating in a club somewhere but I really don't enjoying getting drunk and I just feel uncomfortable in the presence of strangers so a club isn't exactly ideal for me and that's all they seem to do now. I don't find my family comforting and I'd never confide in any of them. And the 1 friend I used to talk to about shit going on in my head, we can barely hold a conversation anymore. I'm 19 and work in a supermarket (I know there's people that can't find work) but I feel like I'm in auto pilot all the time and like it's so meaningless. I'm still a virgin because I'm so skinny that I can't even go outside in just a tshirt even in the middle of summer because I'm so self conscious so how the fuck could I expect someone else to accept me. So yeh I just sit in my room in the dark playing video games screaming at my TV trying to vent my rage that stems from my utter dissatisfaction that is my life. Idk just felt like I wanted to anonymously get everything off my chest.. Happy new year I guess..

"Looking back, I am literally in the same spot I was a year ago (physically, as well as mentally), at one of my best-friends houses, sitting at this pc, about to play some league with her. And thats it. Im still as depressed, probably even more now, Im feeling just as awful about being here, and more with every second. I was hoping I'd find the courage to check out many months ago, but I failed to find it. Perhaps, this will finally be my year... oh well, happy new years anyways I guess",5,same spot I was a year ago
"Recently made a post about how I was going to stop self harming it's now 12:45 no one has wished me a happy new year not my parents or the freinds I believed cared about me. This has just showed me that no one truly cares and I'm about ready to give up

Who knows if I'll even be alive by the end of these four years? For now I'm grateful just to have my healthcare, but who knows how long that will last. It's not like anyone would mind if yet another autistic with disablites was dead, since apparently I'm just a 'cancer' to society, riiiiiiight? /Sarcasm/ It's like like is a collective joke and everyone's laughing, but I can't see the joke. People see hope in this man, but all I see is a clone of my abusive father. I see a man that hurts people, and is in power, just like dad was. I don't see anything to hope for.

"On his deathbed in the hospital, he pointed at me, shaking his head and said, ""You're no good.""

That was 9 years ago?

I've always thought that it was all nonsense, I don't believe in the whole 'dying person's prophecies' as my family calls it. But now that I'm in my early 20s, still plagued with depression, and having a mindset of not wanting to work... I'm starting to worry that I'm starting to turn out as the 'no good' person my grandpa said that I'll become.

I know fate is our own to carve, I don't want to get into the whole determinism VS free-will debate but I believe that we should all be responsible for our choices. And right now, although I'm still employed, I have seriously considered quitting several times, and what's my reason? I'm tired of work. Real tired of working.

My only consolation is that I'm thrifty and sensible. BUT, my dad spends a lot thanks to his illnesses, cigarettes, lottery and luxurious meals, EVEN THOUGH WE'RE POOR.

Sigh... Life is a meaningless trudge, we all die some day, so why can't I die soon? Maybe if I know that I'll die soon, I could quit my job and not worry about saving for retirement! Wishful thinking...

"I've been through some rough times now, just entered college and couldn't talk to anyone for a while... Against all the odds, I managed to befriend two great guys, one with an incredibly positive posture and one that shares my pain.

I've been thinking a lot, as always.. and maybe things can change now. I am changing habits, thinking stuff through and making solid routines. Maybe I'm not such a waste of space.

What I mean is, I've been there. And even though it seems like the cause of the suffering will never go away... There is a way to cope with it. In a healthy way.

Maybe you are right that nobody can change your mind about your existential crisis. If God doesn't exist, then there is no right or wrong etc, etc.

I still haven't changed my mind. But maybe, just maybe, I can still be happy.

I guess this was just a vent or something. I don't know. It may sound cliche, but my change in view coincided with the new year's eve, so I may as well grab the chance.

Happy 2017 for you all, and don't be shy to tell yourself to change to the better, even slightly.",5,"cause of suffering will never go away, existential crisis, if god dosent exist"
"Is this a normal symptom of depression? I am really, really bored with life. It scares the fucking shit out of me. Like I'm scared I would do something to myself, even though i know I wouldn't. I have things I could do, shopping, exercise, reading, watching TV. They just all sound pointless. And life feels incredibly boring and that is scaring the shit out of me.

"Organizing my thoughts enough to make this make sense is difficult.

I have a bad habit of trying to smoke and work my time away, because on the clock is the only time that I'm not exhausted and angry. Neither of my two current jobs keep me busy enough, so I've started searching for a third. I've stopped smoking weed for the search, and now the depression is deepening again.

The smallest things make me want to rage endlessly, destroying everything around me, but I don't even have the energy to waste on being angry. I've never let myself consider suicide or self harm, so I'm stuck in a shitty nihilistic spiral of hating to live and living to hate.

I feel like my only desires are to pass the time until I can die without hurting my loved ones, and to minimize any negative impact I may have on those around me along the way. I figure if I can't be happy, I might as well not bring others down.

"I'm a girl in my mid twenties who has two friends, a job that's steadily decreasing my hours, no car, and no real hobbies. I've struggled between keeping myself entertained, keeping my depression at bay, and balancing my anxiety with my attempts at socialization. But I feel like no matter what I do, I always end up feeling alone. 
I used to be parts of groups, used to make friends in school, used to have things to do outside the house. But now I feel like I'm going through the motions of each day and not taking anything away from them. 
The worst part is feeling alone when I'm surrounded by people. I was out just two days ago and almost immediately wanted to head home. I've always considered myself an extrovert but lately I've found it hard to connect with people. Even in my own home, where I have a few roommates, I feel like nothing I do to interact with them is ever enough. One of them is obsessed with his video games, one is barely ever home, and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that I always feel like I'm bothering her when I try to hang out. And now the icing on the cake is last minute cancelation of our New Years plans (for valid reasons), but then instead of the four of us watching the ball drop together, everyone went to bed early leaving me yet again alone. Now I'm ringing in the New Year crying and writing this down, hoping if I make sense of my crippling loneliness, then there's hope in 2017 I can do something about it.

"I've felt proud of my success in overcoming most of my depression in 2016, and at least making some progress in seeing most people as good. But the end of this year has really taken a toll on me, especially after the election. It's not because of who people voted for, but because of all the horrible things on the Internet that resulted from it! I've always taken comments a little more seriously than most, but why not? If people express what they're really thinking on the Internet, than how can you trust anyone? How many people are friends with another race, then talk s*** about them online? How many people lack empathy for others? How many people condemn others for trying to speak out against hate? How many people really care? 








Despite thinking all this, I've still resolved to being a kind person and trying to understand others, even if their way of thinking is unfathomable to me. But i don't know if i can keep up the faith if this is how people really think. I just want people to be caring, but i know it's not as simple as that.

Sometimes I think of hurting myself, or killing myself. the one thing that stops me is knowing that it would only hurt my family, and my clients. I work a lot and love my jobs (work with special needs individuals) and i will not do that to them. if did not have my jobs and my clients who love me i would do something but i do n0t.

"warning: fairly negative post. 

Feeling lonely &amp; not having friends used to bother me a lot. I thought having people reaching out &amp; caring about me would help me feel better about life. 

   Then I started a program in college where everyone is really ""tight"" with each other. So now I'm not totally isolated like going weeks without talking to people, like it was before. 

   These people are nice, fun &amp; share the same interests as me. There's no reason I couldn't be friends with them. But these relationships don't make me not want to erase my existence anymore, or pull me out of a shell, more confident, cheerful every once in a while, ad nauseum. It's not that they're ""not enough"" or something, it's just that nothing can fix me.

   I guess this past year has really proven that to me. That element of ""I wish ____ would just contact me, it would prove I'm not worthless and someone cares"" is gone, and it's honestly a relief. Kind of like sinking into a somewhat comfortable void. But it definitely scares me for the years to come.

The problem is I've been fighting like hell to keep myself out of depression after losing my grandfather in October. She's been drunk since she got here (she drank a shit ton before we picked her up) and has been saying pretty mean things. I know she's drunk and over emotional right now, but I feel like an idiot for taking on the responsibility of helping her when I'm not even in the right mindset myself.

I've been feeling so darn depressed for the past years and it has gotten so much worse lately. I only eat and sleep, like, all day.I have nightmares every time I try to sleep, and I wake up feeling like shit. I got so much to study and I've fallen behind.  I feel so empty and no matter how much I've tried to give my life some meaning, it all feels so pointless. I'm sick of waking up, I'm sick of breathing, I'm sick of being here. 
I haven't been diagnosed with any kind of mental illness, basically because I avoid talking to people about how I feel. (Can't afford a therapist either). However, I don't know if a diagnosis would matter. Because I kind of feel helpless and I really feel like it doesn't even fucking matter if some prof in a coat tell me ""oh hey something is wrong with your head"". (no shit man) This feels so overwhelming, and dealing with it seems impossible. 
I've talked to some of the people around me, but most of them are the kind of people that like memes about mental Illnesses, so their reactions were like ""Oh I'm depressed too haha"" , or ""You have nightmares? Welcome to the club"", ""you're suicidal? Cool me too!"".
Reactions by the same people who said they don't want to die because they have things they want to do.(Don't get me wrong, I love my friends)

"I've been experiencing depression for around 6-7 years now, and there's a theme I've found in my experience when I'm not in a terrible, suicide attempt-filled rut: I feel as though I settle for everything.  Whether it be my skills as a musician (one of the few things I cherish in life), my relationship status, or my career/educational field.  I currently am not as good of a guitarist as I should be, if I actually put in more work.  I'm very lazy, and almost scared to do it, for fear that I will fail.  I'm settling for my mediocre skills there.  I'm seeing someone, and have been for a little over three months (with a one week break in the middle there), who I don't love.  She's a great friend, but i would admit that since it's my first term, I really did jump at the first chance I had for a relationship.  She's madly in love with me, but I have no feelings for the greater part of the time we've been together.  I'm afraid of being alone.  I'm aware I'm hurting her by doing this, and she doesn't even know it.  So I'm also settling in the relationship realm.  On top of those two, I just started last fall at a college I don't enjoy being at.  Don't get me wrong, the education is amazing, and I got on the deans list for my first term, but I moved from Chicago to this rural area for college and I'm bored out of my fucking mind there.  I go back on Monday, by the way.  Fun stuff.  I'm settling here as well, because I'm getting an education somewhere that I don't necessarily enjoy being at.

All's well and we depart from them around 11 hoping to find something to do as a couple. We end up coming to the conclusion that we have nowhere to be and go home to do what we always do. My husband plays on his xbox and I watch youtube videos. Literally. I've been depressed for years but its little situations like this that get to me. How did I let myself get to this point? I used to have so many friends and so many things to do. But I always just push everyone away and I don't realize it until its too late and too far gone for an apology. I did however start a new job today after not working for the past year and a half after giving birth to my son and staying home to take care of him. I'm hoping things will change. New job, new semester. I just can't help but to cry though. My husband gave me a peck at midnight and he continued on and so did I. He fell asleep around 2am and I ended up leaving and just getting back home 2 hours later. I went for a drive and walked around Wal-Mart. Yeah. Its not our relationship that saddens me or anything about my home life or anything in particular. I feel like everyday gets slightly worse.

There's no one to share in my successes, no one who's there for me when I'm extra sad, no one who cares about what I'm thinking, no one who even enjoys my company.  I'm just worthless",5,"noone gives slightest fuck about me, no one cares about me, no one enjoys my company, I'm worthless"
"i'm not sure if i have a depression, but i just feel really empty and and depressed for one and half years. i have no one to talk to, not only about my feelings, but just in general (for example, i spent new year's eve all alone though it is an important celebration in my country), though people my age (14) have many friends and are really sociable. it's actually the main problem why i want to see a psychologist. and i also just confused with myself.
so i just don't know if it is not pointless to  talk with therapist. is it really helpful? or it's just waste of time and money
(i'm so bad at english, sorry, but i don't know where else i can ask for advice)

"Okay everyone hello there, recently I've been having extreme panic attacks and depression. It all started with me crying imagining what would happen to me if my parents died on public transport. My mum instantly comforted me and told me that wouldn't happen (I'm 13). I continued on to yesterday which as you all know is New year's. I started getting even more panicky thinking about what happens after life and that if I die is that it? I solved that by reading some theories on after life and forming my opinion that we go into a sort of lounge with the spirits who wait for us. After that I've lost all ambition to become an entrepreneur and just thinking of what point is there to life. I've been able to get myself out of the panicky state only when watching youtube or playing video games. Any other time I end up being highly stressed for some unknown reason.  Please reddit help me  ",5,I started getting even more panicky thinking about what happens after life 
"I went to a club with pretty good DJs last night. I went there last year as well and enjoyed it. Last night though at first I was fine and everything was cool but it got to just after midnight and I got this overwhelming feeling that I should leave.

I have been feeling low for the past couple days and just felt really anxious and upset on the day of NYE. My mood had slightly picked up before we went out but once we were there I just couldn't escape what I was feeling. My girlfriend was naturally really upset and couldn't understand why I wanted to leave. After having a bit of a row I just yelled ""It's because I'm fucking depressed!"" and left by myself. 

I have feelings of guilt - obviously I know she wanted me there but I let this mood I'm having control what I do. It must have looked strange to everyone and I feel like I wasted the night and an opportunity to have fun. Having said that the feeling I had making me want to leave was so overwhelming I wouldn't have enjoyed myself at all.

This scares me - this hasn't happened before, I am usually a sociable person and enjoy having fun with my friends. For the past couple of weeks though I've had this feeling that I just want to stay in bed and do nothing - finally last night I acted on it.

Is this depression? I really can't tell if I am or not and it worries me that this behaviour might be the start of it.",5,feeling low for the past couple days and just felt really anxious and upset
"   2016 was probably one of the most difficult years with my depression and I think a big reason for that is because I let it. I pushed people away,  not because I wanted to be alone, but because it was less exhausting than going out and doing stuff. I waited way to long to go back to my therapist and it just continued to snowball to the point that I felt there was no way out of it.
   I've recently taken a big step towards improving my well being and I am hoping that this will make 2017 a little more bearable. This step,  being medication,  has been something I've been reluctant to take as I felt like a failure. In hindsight, it's really no different than taking a medication for any other illness and in order to get better I think this is something I have to do. 

Cheers to a better 2017 for anyone fighting an illness. ",5," I wanted to be alone, but because it was less exhausting than going out and doing stuff"
"For my whole life I think I've never felt a genuine deep connection to anybody, maybe except for my mom. That's why I never feel like I belong, even when people like me and I like them, it still doesn't feel like I'd want it to. So now I wonder if this will ever change of if I have too high expections. But then again there are a lot of peple in this world that don't feel lonely and disconnected ",5," never felt a genuine connection, feel like I never belong"
"I want to die, but I love my boyfriend with all my heart. He's the only person in my life who has shown me what it is to just love someone. He's the only part of being alive that I like. My job sucks. My family sucks and without him I would have killed myself a year ago. 

I still don't want to live, and my functioning is going downhill fast. I want to figure out how to want this life. I want the desire to be present because it's not just me anymore, but I don't know where or how to start. 

How do I escape this pain?",5,"boyfriend the only person who loves, job sucks, family sucks"
Spent new years alone (see my other post for details)  when it hit 1AM and I knew no one was going to talk to me that night or wish me well I wrote my note and tried suicide drank a lot then when I was good and drunk I cut a lot and passed out turns out I was too drunk to go deep enough but I've come into work wishing I hadn't woken up i cant even fake a smile I'm so angry I failed no one at work has seemed to notice I'm upset so looks like no one cares about me after all ,5,"knew no onw was going to talk , cant even fake a smile, angry I failed"
"I seriously need to vent and would appreciate your opinions

The last months have been pretty rough, but I've been trying to keep it together.
I'm always the one who asks if you're okay, if I could help. 
I'm the one you can depend on, always. My phone's always on vibration, so I can be there for the people around me. 
I really try my best to give as much love to this world as I can, but it's tearing me apart.
It feels like nobody really cares about me and my feelings. Nobody's really interested in me for the person I am. We live in a cold, heartless world and it feels like they're only interested in me, because I'm giving them the security and love they can't get elsewhere.
I'm there for them in their darkest hours, but as soon as the sky clears up, they don't need me any longer.

I'm currently isolating myself from others and from myself/my feelings.

Does anyone else feel like this as well? 
 What do you do about it?",5,"nobody really cares , nobobody is interested, we live in a cold heartless palce, isolating self"
Causing the only people who care about me to be driven away only making me more depressed. I just want it all to end and feel happy once more so badly ,5,driving away people who care  making more depressed
"I don't enjoy the ""nice"" things other people seem to enjoy. Whenever I hear people treating themselves to nice things - a nice meal, a nice drink, a nice bubble bath, a nice warm bed, a nice movie, a nice fuzzy or otherwise comfortable garment, a nice place to be or visit - all I can think to myself is ""How miserable it must be to enjoy those things alone. I could do any one of those things right now, but it wouldn't make me feel better. It would make me feel worse for trying to 'take care of' myself like I'm some wounded baby that needs nursing."" Especially reading a book. Dear God, I could never distract myself from the disconnect I feel inside of me to enjoy reading a book

Why don't I get that little rush of dopamine from behavior others find rewarding?",5,"enjoying things alone, miserable"
"Wtf is wrong with the world ? people killing others for no reasons, people thinking money is worth more than a human life. The wolrd we live in is so depressing. I'm depressed since i'm 16 (now 19) and i'm not doing better. I take pills and i consult a psychologist but it doesn't work. I don't like doing a lot of things, when i start a new project i either fail or i lose my interest after a couple of weeks and i just give up. I don't go to school because i suck at it and i'm unemployed because i hate every job i do and it makes me even more depressed. I cry almost every night for no reason and it's very hard for me to sleep because my head is always full of shit. I'm too tired to do something but not enough to fall asleep. Basically, i'm just sitting at home doing nothing. Let me tell you, it's fucking boring ! I don't really know what to do to get better, at least i have friends and family that care about me and support me through this, they are the reason why i'm still here today. I just wanted to know if anyone is going through the same shit as I am. No one really understand how i'm felling and it's sad because they want to help but they can't ... i feel like nobody can help me. I'm here, in my bedroom, waiting for my body to die of sadness. I feel empty because my soul died a long time ago.",5,"people killing others for no reason, cry every night, boring"
