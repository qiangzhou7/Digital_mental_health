"Halloween is bad because you get to see how much of a loser you are and how lonely you are. You get watch all night in agony, the stories and post of others having fun that you will literally never experience.

Birthdays are bad because no one cares enough to remember. Not as lonely necessarily, but disappointing. You are a certain age, you should have certain experiences and skill, but you donât. You should have accomplished something in an entire year, right? No, you are a worthless and pathetic waste of energy. Someone should really kill me, because all I am is a waste.

Tonight I get the suffering of both those holiday is one night. I spent a whole week without crying, I spend almost 2 weeks without cutting. Thatâs gone now. I really really wanna just end it. I have the note in the desk drawer.


Either way, lots of my blood and tears will be shed tonight.

"That is one of my rare social outings. I am in my 40's and have social anxiety among other things. Never been in a relationship. I don't go out of the house much except for my work and running my needed errands. Prefer being at home but also wish I had the desire to go out and enjoy myself. I mostly live a lonely unfulfilling existence. Hate New Years, hate birthdays. Hate anything that makes me realize time is moving forward and I am not.

"As my depression has only gotten worse and worse over time, this is quite obviously the worst New Years Iâve ever had. Iâm here, laying in bed, browsing this sub while occasionally checking Snapchat to see all of my friends out having the time of their lives. I was invited to a few parties, but itâs wishful thinking to imagine myself having gone to any of them. So here I am, in this shithole apartment, with my mother sleeping in the bed next to mine so I canât even get up to have a smoke without waking her. Iâm only 17, I should be out having fun, meeting people, experiencing my youth, but my depression and anxiety are so bad I could hardly muster up the courage to even set foot outside. I canât believe this is how I ended up. I know I know, Iâm still young, I havenât quite âended upâ anywhere yet, but Iâve more or less made up my mind that suicide is the end goal. And with how bad my depression is getting, itâs gonna happen sooner rather than later. Anyway, Happy New Year. I hope 2018 wonât be as rotten as 2017 was but odds are I wonât make it halfway through before knotting up a rope and hanging myself.

"i see all the people celebrating, all the big lights, the fireworks, the ornaments, but none of it moves me even just a little. what is new years but just another excuse for all the sheep to get belligerent, numbing themselves from the bigger picture? ""tradition""? fuck that, there's no such thing behind it. christmas and new years are a masterclass in capitalism at work. valentines, easter, halloween, etc. are all crash courses in capitalism, but new years/christmas are the phd. it makes me sick. all these sheep spending all their hard earned loot on things they think they can't live without, which really won't yield anything of substance, only one fleeting moment of feigned happiness. is it worth it? are you so miserable that retail therapy is what you turn to to feel better for one moment? all this shit is a topical anaesthetic, never getting at the meat of it. society is so doomed. 

culture doesn't exist anymore. we're afraid of our history. on this relentless pursuit of creating a unified world we're negating our rich cultural heritages, which can be curated to leave out the negatives.

is sex really the *only* thing that matters in life? it seems it's everyones prime motive. make money. why? so you can attract cheap people who'll fuck you once they know you've got it? money is just another topical anaesthetic. might as well be monopoly money, because none of what it gets you has any real substance. the only reason you want it is so you can quench your insatiable thirst for fucking. anyone who claims sex isn't the core of it all just never got enough of it so lies to themselves, taking a fake moral high ground- fuck you. we're living in an era where plethoras of shit relationships abound. relationships formed not organically, but by way of swiping right on an app on our phones for fucks sake. absolutely repulsive, breading legions of hedonists who later in life will have to hide their pasts from their partners. ""wholesome""? what the fuck is that... a relic of a long defunct past. there's more to relationships than sex-appeal- it's those little idiosyncrasies which make you want someone in the long run; those little quirky things which make them uniquely them, which you'll never get to know just by swiping right. and even for those who don't dabble in this e-fornication, they're doing it all wrong for the most part. a great lasting relationship will only become harder and harder to find moving forward. and even those that exist, a lot of them are founded under false pretences. people are seldom honest, thinking their lies will get them ahead, but they only land you deeper in a hole. be honest with yourselves and with others. 

society today is pathetic. every single person, young or old, glued to their damn 'smart' devices which serve no purpose other than to dumb you down- perfect irony. i'm 28, but am living among hoards of technosheep instead of real humans who thrive off personal contact. it's sickening. everyone living their lives for your viewing pleasure, presenting you perfectly curated renditions of their ideal, which they'll never really have. everything is so shallow, never venturing to go beyond the surface. there might be factions of people who don't adhere to this new way of life, but fuck it, so what? it's only getting worse. 

buy, buy, buy, drink, drink, drink, fuck, fuck, fuck. 

i used to feel like an outsider-- an alien walking around this foreign planet--, but lately i feel like it's the other way around, like all these sheep are prancing around this perfect world and i'm seeing it for what it is.

"Well, I am new to the Reddit app. I have been learning and researching about depression,anxiety, and many other mental disorders. But what I have came across is summarizing,paraphrasing,emotional intelligence, and emotional balance. Please consider reading this post. I have done a good amount of research. If someone has done research(science included) and want to share his/her opinion, they are scientifically correct because if you have science to defend your theory/opinion/idea/thesis/conclusions you are correct.

To start off,summarizing and paraphrasing is the most important thing when researching/investigating because that way you'll learn anything with 100% perfect clarity. In order to paraphrase and summarize you simply have to put what you have read and seen in your words. Summarizing and paraphrasing is scientifically proven the best way to learn anything.

Emotional Intelligence(EQ) or (EI) is the ability to take control of your emotions and also being able of controlling others emotionally such as intimidating someone, scaring someone,dominating someone, and so on. Emotional Intelligence is the skill of taking control of your emotions and by taking control of your emotions you will not let fear,panic,depression,anxiety,anger,shyness,nervousness control your mind. Always maintain your mind under control. EQ is much more important than IQ(intelligence).

There are many articles on the internet claiming they can cure social anxiety, and other mental disorders, but in reality is much more complex than simply saying things like; Be more open to people, be confident, talk to girls. All of these tips/advises are nothing but helpless information for people with different mental disorders(same as mental illness).

Emotional Balance means to control and keep your emotions balanced, don't let sadness, and other feelings/emotions take control of your mind and body completely.

"I just, I wish admitting I lost everything would help me heal, because of delusional, naive, immature, greedy, selfish, entitled, privileged feelings. 

I'm still making awful mistakes..like I haven't learned anything. 

but I just, I can't accept everything that has happened without crumbling completely. 

I am still doing exactly the same things over and over again because I'm an idiot. because I can't just decide to do different. because I'm weak and broken. 

nature can be cruel. why should it be any different? Why should I expect any different? if I want to ignore the rules of society, then am I no better than an animal? should I be treated like on?

I'm just miserable and there is a sickening certainty I have about things only getting worse. 

I'm crying out to people who can't help me. I feel like I'm screaming into a void. I feel helpless and broken and weak and ignored and worthless. 

why did my life have to turn into this. I made mistakes yes. but like this? this is what I deserve? wishing to die in my sleep because I find no joy in life, no passion, nothing to pursue or take interest in. I haven't committed suicide over these last 6 years, fighting the urge on a weekly basis at the least, because my family doesn't deserve to experience that pain. 

was I such a terrible person to deserve this? or do I continue to see all these little choices as things that don't matter, when they are exactly what should be of most importance. 

I'm just going to rot away. I'm sorry I can't do better. I signed up big time and I can't recover from it. I'm always going to be stuck with this deep regret that I should have done differently. that I should have been smarter or more careful. 

but no. I just, took a huge risk, and lost just about everything. I don't recognize myself anymore. I don't feel like myself. I feel like being hurt so much has fundamentally changed me, and I feel like I just don't have the ability to wait it out through small steps and hard work. 

I always worked hard. always. now I'm tired. I worked so hard just to throw it all away. I worked so hard to build the beginning of a good life just to get distracted by something shinier, and now nothing is as shiny as that thing, not even that thing itself. it's gone.. I have nothing left to look forward to. I'm broken and I'm miserable and I just wish the torture would end, one way or another. I can't take it anymore. I can't take these feelings, these regrets. I can't keep making excuses and trying to convince myself into something to make it seem less awful feeling. I can't even begin to convey the amount of pain this loss has caused. I can't stop feeling like I'm going to lose more unless I accept what I've already lost, be an adult and stop whining over things that can't be changed. 

I just, I've never let this stuff out. I've never taken down the delusion and stared my grief in the face. and sometimes I'm so numb from the pain that I don't even know what I'm missing. because it felt that way then, and it still feels the same. something important is missing from my life.

Been at the tipping point for a while now, although for some reason my death would upset some people so i refuse to do it as much as i want to. Problem is, living in this state is really hard as i feel as though im forced to live.

The advice im after is, what does going to counselling actually do? Because i've sat for numerous hours thinking about it, but can't see any way it would help?

"TLDR One can often feel fine mentally, but be unable to present this to the world, because the body manifests depression so thoroughly on a physical level. The face and body present depression, to the point where its literaly impossible to smile or convey any genuine impression of yourself, even though you should otherwise be mentally fine.  


...


Example, I wake up in the morning, my mood is more or less fine and i feel ready to go to work and go about my day. I get out of bed and i feel a little stiff and achy, maybe dehydrated. 

Go to the bathroom and in the mirror Im like ""Oh no, what the fuck is that!?"" I look unbelievably sad and unhealthy, my eyes are hollow and look sad and weak, I dont recognise myself in this face at all. I summon up the emotions that made me quite confident yesterday, but they barely register on the face. Its impossible to smile, it looks like a grimace. 

I soend half an hour in front of the mirror trying to force myself to look normal and composed, but every time i turn back and catch myself again i see this shell emanating horrible vibes. 

Again, i didnt wake up feeling this way, I wasnt even aware of it until i became aware of myself physically by 1) moving around and 2) observing myself. 

You end up almost late for work because you cant convince yourself to leave the house. It might even be easier if you were mentally down, at least that would fit with your physical self image now. 

People at work say, ""Ive not seen you so depressed, whats got you down"", or ""I think i know what youre sad about"". But for all that, it is nothing in particular you're down *about* - it is a physical thing. 

You just want your face to cheer up and your shoulders to relax so you can be yourself, but its physically impossible. There are no tricks or thoughts that will lift you out of it. The subtlest or most powerful *thought* doesnt matter because your body is not physically expressing what is happening inside. 

We always talk about depression as a *mental* illness but in my experience its the physical factors that predominate, and to such an extent that the ability to deal with it mentally *almost doesnt matter*. You can have your thoughts in order but what your body is presenting to the world physically is an impossible barrier to overcome.

I just don't understand why I should like myself, if anything it'd be irrational not to hate myself because every single aspect of my life is going terribly and it's ultimately no-one's fault but my own.",5,"not smart, not charismatic, not good looking, not a good person, not got social skills, got no talents or skills,  bad at everything, boring, hate myself"
I did something really stupid cause i panicked and swerved into another car. Iâve had nightmares of this scenario happening. Why canât I do anything right? I hate existing so much. I hate myself. I hate how useless I am. I hate how anxious I get. I hate how i get easily distracted by my own thoughts. I hate how I caused unecessary financial issues. Im just glad no one was hurt. ,5,"panicked and swerved into another car,nightmares of this scenario,hate existing,hate myself,hate how useles,unncessary financial issues,"
