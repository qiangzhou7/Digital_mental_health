"The worst thing with depression for me is that I am at the stage where I am constantly expecting bad things to happen. I am always on edge, always wondering when the next bad thing is gonna happen. I get nervous when the phone vibrates, when I see new emails or when I get letters out of the mailbox. I even get small moments of relief after Ive checked my email and see that there is nothing bad there. Anyone else relate to this?",5,"phone vibrates, nervous,bad things to happen"
"2017 for me was the equivalent of putting a load of expensive and high-end ingredients into a pot, cooking it, and having it taste rancid in the end. I had such great experiences and growth this year, but it feels like it hasn't given me the fulfilment I really want. I can't really tell this to anyone I know, since they'll think I am ungrateful or spoiled.

"I should be happy. I have a job and a man who loves me and I live in a beautiful place because of him. I feel bad for feeling bad. All the shit in my life, the pain, the abuse, the rape...I don't even know if that's what hurts or if it's just the existential dread that I am nothing and am useless. I don't know if finishing grad school will even make me happy, because how could I ever be happy? I keep searching for meaning or being able to feel SOMETHING, literally anything but this blah-ness that encompasses everything I do. I drink, I go out, I go on rollar coasters, I run away for a month and nothing changes. Everything still feels like nothing. I'm empty. The only time I feel alive is when I'm playing video games because then I'm not me, I'm doing something totally abnormal. But my life is meaningless. There is not light, no happiness. I get brief glimpses of that feeling I don't even remember when my bf hugs me or shows he cares in some small way but overwhelmingly I'm just...empty. And it's isolating to feel like this. I feel so alone. He tries to understand but he doesn't live in my head, he can't know. I appreciate that he tries but I still feel overwhelmingly alone.

"I'm not sure if this is just because I'm growing up and becoming an adult, but I don't seem to have much emotion at all anymore. I just don't really care about anything, I'm never really sad and I'm never really happy. I'm just.. neutral.. all the time. Whereas in the past I remember having fun and happy times, I feel like happiness is a feeling that I *used* to experience, but I don't really get anymore.

I'm just existing because that's what everyone else is doing, going about my day doing whatever, sorta like a robot with no purpose. I constantly ponder how meaningless everything is. I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago and honestly, it barely affected me. My emotions just seem completely dulled down.

"The new year is already stressing me out. Last night was alright, and I was trying my best to stay positive. I woke up this morning feeling really good and motivated.

I spent the day thinking about how I've never done anything cool, I don't have anything to be proud of, I have no friends, no money, nothing.

"So I would like to say when it started but my memory is of no use, since I only remember a few things, it is not short term memory though (it's not that bad), apparently it has do with my brain only remembering thing it thinks important. Any way, I am not depressed but many of you guys have similar problems based on some posts I have seen. Here is my reasoning behind this feeling, most people I know or have met when I was smaller said I was really charismatic, outgoing, etc but that I changed all of a sudden what I can guess was when I was around 6-7 based in the few memories I have. I became serious with out any sign of change and now I don't care about anything, but mean absolutely anything it is what can only be described as ""detached"". It could have been from suppression of who I am since that age because of people having expectations for me resulting in me not developing any real hobbies/interests  and knowing how to express my likes/dislikes or due to some other events that led me to suppress myself. Anyway that's my guess but I still don't know why I don't care anymore and how to move forward.",5,"don't care about anything, detached"

"I used to try to talk to people about my depression, and tell them how I felt. In the end it only pushed people alway. No one wants to hear about your depression and the things you go through that suck. All they want to hear about is how successful you are, the jokes you have to tell, in general, the positives you can add to their lives. If you think you've found something different I promise you, you haven't, you're just missing whatever that other person is getting out of you. 
As shitty as this sounds, once you know this, you can rearrange your behavior to reflect how people really feel. Why try and talk about your depression with someone? In the end you're really just bringing them down. It's better to focus on something positive or if you can't just make some space and don't talk about anything at all. The people people love to be around are ""always in a good mood"" or ""always down to have a good time"". Chances are these people have issues as well they probably just handle them better. They know that no one really cares about their problems, and people just want someone they can have fun with so they play them game. And when these people can't play the game anymore they spend sometime alone. Sure, maybe some people are just naturally happier than others but that doesn't mean that even naturally unhappy people can't use the same strategy. They might just have to spend more time by themselves. 

Ultimately my New Years resolution is to keep more of myself to myself, to be more positive around others even if I don't feel it within myself and most importantly, to take that time to myself to know when I can't put on the face anymore. ",5,"pushed people always, no one really cares"

"I have never been diagnosed with depression or even talked to a professional about it being a possibility.
But I used to think about it a lot. Especially during the last several years of my previous relationship.
I felt like the worst human being because my SO was actually a wonderful person, but I couldn't bring myself to feel happy. Instead, I felt trapped. I often thought I would eventually have to consider suicide if I wanted to get out of it, but I didn't need to worry because I wasn't at that stage yet. I just cried a lot. I also grew to find self harm theraputic, but knew I wouldn't do anything 'too far'. When I did end that relationship, I did an emotional 180, which let me justify and blame all those feelings on the relationship. And up until now I believed that.

I have been in my current relationship for a little less than a year and I am just starting to feel myself sink. But this time it has nothing to do with my SO. In fact, I'm terrified because I'm so invested in them and I don't want them to see me this way. I'm scared of losing them because all I can do is sit around and be a pathetic mop of a person.
I know how good my life is right now so I don't want to do anything to damage it.
I don't have anyone that I am comfortable opening up to with my emotional stuff.

I then get a sense of relief, and I'm happy for all of two seconds cause I get to stay home, but the happiness fades, and I'm back to being depressed cause I can't hang out.

The opposite also happens. When my friend tells me that he can hang out, I get this feeling of dread, and I have to force myself to not cancel my plans. After we hang out, I ended up exhausted and tired, but a little bit less depressed.

"I have nobody in my life right now, and life seems meaningless because of it. I think that committing suicide is a good idea, but I want to give it a few years first until I really really can't take it anymore before I go there.

I've seen a lot of horrible stuff in my life, and I don't doubt that I will become a sociopath or criminal because of it down the road. So maybe it is better that I kill myself sooner rather than later.

I was raised by my mom and her brother, who was into a lot of trouble with both the law and other criminals. I witnessed him being assaulted four times as a little kid, and he would have shouting matches on the phone with people every night. My mom finally kicked him out when I was 11, and I never saw him again.

My mom died of cancer last July. She'd been fighting lung cancer since before I was born. We had a terrible relationship, but there were still a few good moments that can never come back now.

As fate would have it, my only friend also died of cancer last year. He was only 18.

I live with a friend of my mom's currently. She has a kind heart and gives me food and a place to live, but we barely say a word to one another.

I'm so used to being forgotten, to have promises broken on a whim. If I respect people, I want to get it back, and I usually don't. I'm seen as a cold guy with a mean face, and most people at my school by now think I'm going to go on a rampage and they steer clear of me. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I don't love anyone either. If I saw a stranger dying, I would be more likely to either ignore them or say, ""sucks to be you"" than I would to try to comfort them in their last moments. I know I'm a terrible person for feeling that way, but I know that is the treatment I would also get in that situation. I don't want to be a sociopath or a narcissist, but I feel the world gives me no other choice at times. If I start to care for someone, they pass away or turn against me.",5,"terrible relationship, trouble, law, criminals, assaulted, sociopath, kill myself, meaningless"

Does anyone else emotionally attach themselves to people (like entertainers, celebrities, idols, etc.) almost as a form of escapism, but know that you'll never meet them and it hurts?

I saw my friends cuts on his arm, some weeks they are worse, some better.  The marks of cuts and bruises are extremely visible since he often wears T shirts.  Once I shared my battle with depression and self-harming, thinking that maybe he will open a little bit but it didn't happen. All I know from him is that he has troubles controlling his emotions and uses hurting himself as means of gaining control over the negative feelings.

The thing is


1. I don't know how to react (should I ignore the fresh marks as if they weren't there and go on talking whatever?? Or should I bring it up?)
