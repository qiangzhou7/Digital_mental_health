Forgive me if I sound extremely stupid but I've finally convinced myself after years of ignoring my depression to go see a doctor. I'm confused as to how the process works if a person does get prescribed medication. I know there are tons of different kinds of medication so how does the doctor know which one to prescribe? Do you have a say in which antidepressants you're leaning towards? I know some of them have severe side effects so I'm wondering if after they've talked with you to inspect you if they give you a choice from a list they feel is best or if they usually start you off the bat with one kind of medication without questions asked.,3,severe side effects

She told me she had no more time to waste on me and that she had moved on and did so a long time ago.  She just stayed with me because she felt bad for me.  These are all her words.

I know you are all probably thinking...""here comes some guy who just got dumped and he is feeling depressed so he comes here to bitch and complain.""  That is not the case.  I have had depression my whole entire life.  Im 28 and have been under serious treatment for about 4 years now.  

I have had my ups and downs, but mostly downs.  I was an alcohol and drug abuser but finally quit all of that to try and get better.  This was the first real relationship Ive ever had.  Even in HS and in college I never had someone just to call mine.  

Suicidal thoughts have swirled in my head for as long as I can remember.  At the height of my depression I began to self harm.  Nothing life threatening, but enough to draw blood and feel pain.  While this helped feelings subside a little bit...i always wished I had the balls to dig that razor in as deep as I could and just gashed up my arm.  But I am too much of a coward.

I want my life to be over...Im sick of hearing ""things are going to get better"" . ""try this new brand name medication that costs 500 bucks a bottle.""  ""youre a great guy just give it time""

"hi everyone

I had been doing so well, I was a year and two months SH-clean. I was planning a tattoo to get that would cover all my old scars. 

but tonight brought on an depressive episode that Iâve never experienced before. on my way home, I was wailing/sobbing, talking out loud to myself about what was wrong with me, and then I had a thought that ceased the wailing and brought me to complete silence for the rest of the night. 

âIâm going to kill myself.â

When I got home, I got into comfortable pajamas and researched lethal doses of the medicines I have in my cabinet. I wrote out a note, telling my family and friends that I love them. 

I was nearly about to take the pills, when my cat came around the corner and started purring. She rubbed herself around my ankles, meowing at me happily. 

I broke down in tears, realizing what I was about to do. I later cut myself, which I justified to myself as being an âalternativeâ to suicide.

"Hi there this is my first post. I'm on a throwaway just because people who know me know my reddit. I'd also like to say my family knows about this and I'm currently in CBT which has helped in some ways, but not in others. I'm also on an antidepressant.


I'm 28. My *entire* life I was always happy, laid back, protective, loved animals and especially dogs with all my soul, loved my spouse of 8 years and naturally looked past their flaws, never felt violent or unstable in the slightest. I was connected to everything I cared about. I spent a few years frustrated and depressed but I still felt love, kindness and interest.



6 months ago I had a total and complete mental breakdown. I experienced a violent thought followed by 10 minutes of visceral fear, confusion and fury. I was scared I'd hurt my dog. I didn't want my spouse to come home incase I hurt them. for 2 months I had the belief I was secretly some kind of murderer and was afraid to be around either of them alone. Since then I've retained a resentment and almost hatred toward my spouse and I feel insanely uncomfortable around dogs, and my dog specifically. I harbor this belief that I am evil and I spend all day either furious, repulsed or annoyed by my spouse. I also feel completely disconnected from everything I loved: music, hiking, landscapes, art, books, sci-fi and fantasy.. it all feels distant and alien and something I shouldn't be engaging in. I spent 4 months crying every day and now cry maybe twice a week, just because I'm so keenly aware this isn't who I am and I hate it. 



I was known for being almost too laid back before this. No problems with anxiety or anger. I am so confused and hurt and all day my chest is tight and my mind is racing trying to find answers. I almost have a fantasy of leaving my spouse and today I had a horrible thought of 'if they died I might be way better off'. I tried to brush it off as a silly escapism thought (as in CBT) but the very existence of it made me want to kill myself. I actually felt like I wanted it. 7 months ago I couldn't imagine a life without my family, now I feel like a prisoner to them, and they're so damn supportive, because my spouse knows this isn't me. I'm just scared it is now.


I've been told it's OCD, but I think a lot of it may be depression as well. I don't know what to do really. I mean I know I should wait and get better before making any decisions about anything, but I feel so angry and stressed and I'm starting to snap and be really snarky to my spouse. It's driving me insane.



Can anyone help with some advice, or similar situations, or anything? This is kind of just a cry for help of any kind whatsoever. I'm getting better at dealing with it but it still feels like a railroad spike in my chest and a demon in my head. I feel so bad and evil, and it feels like any good thing I do is forced because I feel like doing the opposite.

I just had my second son. having to wait until the 17th to get back on my meds. I've been clean from severe self harm for the whole pregnancy. in trying hard to maintain. were all aware I will probably have post partum depression since I suffered so badly last time. its started already. 

we all know how scary it is to see yourself circling the drain. knowing you can't stop the fall. 

I have 3 people besides my toddler and newborn sons. my husband of 7 years, my mom, and my best friend. my best friend I don't really like to reach out to. even though she is amazing, I adore her and she's extremely understanding and supportive (because she struggles the same as me). I have an issue reaching out to her. I don't like telling her everything going on. I don't want to trigger her. and, I swear, no matter how much I adore her I just can't bring myself to reach out. 

my absolute best friend ever is my mom. she is a huge reason I have struggles but I have forgiven her over the years and were extremely close. the thing is, she is flaky. as. fuck. she is there for me so often I feel terrible for being upset but she often won't answer texts... like times where im really struggling. and just recently she told me ""I can't fix everything""... it hit me that im asking too much of her. the thing is... she told me she would be there for me since she is well aware of my mental issues. we all discussed my possibility of ppd plus my mental disorders acting up. but then she says that... so I feel like I can't ask for help again...my husband just went back to work and I've been doing ok but yesterday was hard. against the wishes of my depression I reached out to her... she had a new outfit for church.. she said shed come spend some time with me after church before husband got home... she didn't answer my messages. when she did she said shed be at my house ""soon"". it took an hour and a half to get to me with a 10 minute drive. by then mybhusband was getting off work within ten minutes anyways. she just picked up my son, her grandson, and left pretty quickly.. I even told her I didn't want to be alone... 

im a burden. always have been. 

I have a great drug regimen for my mental disorders. Is been hospitalized and my meds got worked out perfectly. well since my first son withdrew from my meds in NICU when he was born I wasmt allowed to stay on them for this last pregnancy. Understandable... I have a lot of guilt for making my oldest sick... 

well my pregnancy psych seemed wary of giving me my meds when I asked, excitedly, if I could have them back after baby was born... she kind of gave a ""well see"" answer... even though im fully diagnosed and im obviously mentally ill and I've told them how well my medications work. my arms are covered in pretty bad scarring. they know I need my medications. im also not on anything scheduled. I refuse things like benzos and adderal because of addiction issues. 

well after talking to my doctor last take and her seeming iffy on giving me my medications I've just been feeling more depressed that I may have to wait months tobget them. I got emotional today because im scared and depressed and he got frustrated with me. 

hes my only other support person. im out of options. he tells me I can talk to him but he just gets angry or frustrated with me. hes a good person. hes a great husband. he just gets upset that he can't do anything... 

but he had just told me yesterday I could talk to him about when im feeling down. then I get snapped at... I feel like I have no one again. 

I want to cut. I won't.. but I want to. I want to hurt myself in some way. I won't. I just want to. I just don't want to hurt mentally anymore. I want to talk to my people... but theyre tired of me. I want so bad to reach out instead of withdraw.. but I guess my only option is to just keep it inside. im tired of feeling like an attention seeker when I keep telling people I feel alone or depressed. or that I keep saying im scared of going downhill. I feel like im begging people to help me and everyone is just tired...

" Hello everyone, 

For the past year and a half, I've struggled with an intense internal conflict. According to my psychologist, I may suffer from a mild to moderate depression. To this day I am prone to loneliness, sleeping problems, feelings of worthlessness, laziness and my intrusive thoughts from my OCD that would never shut up. Earlier this year it was worse, with thoughts of suicide constantly plaguing my mind (probably due to my obsessive thoughts). 

This time last year (Around the beginning of the New Year) I promised myself that I would seek help for what it was that was bothering me. This time last year, I felt hope that I would overcome this. Today though, I don't feel that way. Today, I feel like I am doomed to be alone for the rest of my life, that I am not going to amount to anything, that I will not connect with other human beings as intimiately and deeply as I want to. And that is when I am seeking help. 

The most prominent feeling I have felt throughout this year and a half old depression (it's possibly older than that) is loneliness. Sometimes it feels like an invisible brick wall cuts me off from everyone else, preventing me from forming true bonds with anyone. I feel like my family and friends do not care about my mental health; my family is aware of it but barely checks up on me. My brother (who is overseas) told me that he would check up on me and asked my sister to do so regularly as well. That was five months ago, and my brother has only checked on me a couple of times and my sister has not asked me how I am doing once. Also, my mum had to get a referall to continue my sessions with the psychologist. We got the referral about a month ago and she has yet to give it to the psychologist because she says 'she keeps forgetting' and that I should be the one to remind her. That hit me hard, because it made me feel like my mental health was not her top priority. My parents also say that I can come to them with any issue, but I know that isn't true, because when I do my dad always puts on a judgemental tone which makes me feel like dirt. Also, when my brother came to my parents for help, he ended up getting kicked out of the house. 

As for my 'friends', I question the validity of our friendships. Just today I tried to talk to one friend about how I felt today, and it flew right over his head, and he talked about what he was doing instead. That especially hurt me, because it made me feel that maybe no one in this world wants to hear my problems. With my other friends, I want to tell them so badly about what has happened to me (not one of them knows I have depression and OCD) but I find it so hard to bring up in casual conversation, and I think some of them might be to immature to take it seriosly. I also constantly think about what the basis of my friendships consist of, whether they are deep or superficial. I feel most of them are the latter, which makes me question if I truly even have any friends. 

I guess what brings me here are these questions: how do I cope with all this loneliness and anguish when I feel so alienated and estranged from everyone around me? How do I connect with anyone who I feel isn't willing to truly get to know me? Am I doomed to this depression and loneliness for the rest of my life? Will I never connect with anyone in an intimate way where I can express my inner emotions without fear of judgement, because I feel I cannot even do that with my family.",3,"intrusive thoughts from my OCD that would never shut up,feel like my family and friends do not care about my mental health, my family is aware of it but barely checks up on me,prone to loneliness, sleeping problems, feelings of worthlessness, laziness, "

"With severe anxiety and body dysmorphia it's extremely hard for me to connect socially, though being more social is something I wanted to do this year.

Then today she wrote me that she won't attend the dancing courses with me out of consideration for her boyfriend.

They tell me that theyâve somehow been spying on when Iâm clocking in and out and they want me to clock out when they want to not when the managers want me to. Thatâs how they are-I canât do things my way cause Iâm an immature autistic 23 year old whoâs only staying with them because they offered me a place to stay while I build up money and looked for housing. Iâve been pressured to take a 2nd job in October because they hated how I donât get 40-60 hours a week at least; they donât want me going to therapy unless itâs immediately after a work day so my therapy doesnât conflict with their âvaluable timeâ, and I get praised for doing things their way but scolded for doing things my way. Nothing I do pleases them in the long run; in fact I donât even have the choice to go to the ER to get evaluated (because Iâve had suicidal like thoughts all day) or even quit one of my jobs.
So yes, 2018 has begun and I already wish I was dead",3,"an immature autistic 23 year old, only staying with them because they offered me a place to stay while I build up money and looked for housing, been pressured to take a 2nd job in October,get praised for doing things their way but scolded for doing things my way, nothing I do pleases, waned to die, "
"Early September to early December, for lack of a better description, was a never ending hell for me. Failed all my classes, withdrew from a lot of friends, neglected all my responsibilities, and abused drugs heavily.

In December, I had a stint of self harm, suicidal thoughts, and crazy self destructive behavior that really made me start to think about the bigger picture. I always dismissed my depression, because I thought I was a ""pussy"" for not even being able to feed myself or accomplish anything more than smoking pot, popping benzos and playing call of duty during the day.

But deep down, I knew I wasn't a ""pussy""/loser/failure. And neither are you. I know it's unbelievably hard/impossible to disconnect from that negativity when you're deep in the hole, so I won't tell you to push through it. Because that isn't how depression works, you can't just will yourself to get over it.

What you can do, however, is be honest with yourself. You have depression. It is not something you can shrug off or will away, and it's become a centerpiece of your thought process everyday. 

BUT, you can remember a certain point in your life where you felt happy/content in a natural way. Was it drinking a cup of coffee, and watching the sun rise? Walking around in the woods with headphones on? A good lift in the gym? Being in the company of a good friend? This won't come easy. I've found it helps to write these things down, because your depressed brain will make happy recall very, very hard. Definitely try it out a few times if it doesn't work at first, over the span of multiple days/weeks. This is a process, not a quick fix. 

Now compare those memories to your current day-to-day routine. Me personally, I realized that my college depression was eating me alive, because I didn't have a routine. In high school, I was forced to do the same thing every day. As much as I hated it, I was achieving SOMETHING 5 days of the week. Going to classes, having to get dressed, made a huge difference in my life. Once I moved out and had freedom to do anything, I ironically did NOTHING every day. And that's when I realized really what the root of my issue was. Without accomplishing something productive on a day to day basis, my reward centers slowly started to fade away.

So I forced myself to wake up at 7AM every day, and walk around in the morning for 5 minutes. It was so fucking hard. I completely failed to do it for about a month, then got lucky one day and woke up feeling okay. Managed to accomplish those two tasks. Whoa! That wasn't so bad. I also had to cut out drug use from my life, because pot, benzos, and amphetamines were making it impossible to wake up in the morning.

Granted, I am nowhere close to being out of the woods. If I were to slip into drug use and disregarding my routine every day, I would fall back exactly to where I started. BUT, once you start to feel better, and REALLY internalize the negative effects depression has on your well-being, you can start to be much more proactive about your recovery. I honestly believe the biggest mistake all of us make when we start to feel better, is to disconnect ourselves with how we felt while depressed. It's not something you can leave behind and go back to your old ways. 

Not exactly sure how helpful all of that was, but I hope someone finds it beneficial. 

And for those reading who are currently deep in the hole, just start to introspect. A lot. Write things down. Post on here. Be creative. Hell, even talk out loud if it helps. When depression really, really kicks you to the ground, it has to be the #1 focus in your life. 

And, of course, feel free to reach out to me if you all ever need anything. Everyone deserves to feel content, fulfilled, and happy. Yes, you. I know it doesn't seem like it, but life is worth living &lt;3

Happy new year everyone :) ",3,"abused drugs,withdrew ,loser, failure,"
"I have nobody to talk to. I find it hard to open to talk to people about things. Sometimes if someone asks me something, I can just see in their face that they are losing interest. People really don't give a shit what I have to say about anything. I can't talk to my family about anything because I haven't live near them for years and they don't hardly know anything about what is really going on in my life. Especially not with my depression. 

My SO has been pulling away from me and left me all alone last night because she didn't want to sit home with me and had already made plans with someone without me and didn't even mention anything until she was leaving. I sat home alone and drank myself sick until 3:45 when she finally came home. She didn't even say a word to me. Whenever I try to talk about things, it just ends up back in a circle and we have been in a weird rut for a long time. I have never felt so alone in my life and maybe not as low as this in a long time. I just needed to vent things. I am not looking forward to another year of shit like 2017. I have no motivation anymore. No goals, ambitions and no friends or family immediately close by for me to talk to. I don't know what to do about anything anymore",3,"sat home alone and drank myself sick until 3:45 ,People really don't give a shit what I have to say about anything, I can't talk to my family about anything because I haven't live near them for years, pulling away, alone, drank, "
"Almost a year ago, a attempted suicide. Since then, I've been on meds and doing therapy. Where did it got me? Lost all the friends I had left. I am even more depressed than before starting all this. Realised that it is just not in my head, people really doesn't care about depression or mental illness. 
So, here's to me. 2018 will be the year I will find peace. It will be the year I will stop bothering everyone with my existence. I am done trying when everyone wants me to give up. ",3,"been on meds and doing therapy,bothering everyone, done trying "

"02:00 AM. January 2.

One year ago. At this moment, I committed suicide. I cut my wrists, arms, veins on joints both vertically and horizontally. Blood bath. Over 80 stitches.

Exactly one year ago.

Now, I'm looking at myself. Nothing has changed. I might be one of the mentally worst person here. Still.

Edit: I just went away for something, when I got back :) :)  Thank you all

Edit2: Wow :) People of reddit, you are awesome. Thank you all for everything :)",3,"Over 80 stitches , cut my wrists, arms, veins on joints both vertically and horizontally. Blood bath. ,Nothing has changed,worst person ,"

"When I look at all the problems I have to face and all the issues I've got; my crippling anxiety issues, my huge insecurities about every part of me and my overwhelming jealousy leading to loneliness and isolation it all just seems impossible and pointless trying to fix it. It just seems so hopeless even thinking about how to solve these problems as they all seem so overwhelming and connected that no matter what I do they won't go away.

I cannot even think of a place to start with all this mess because every time I try and fix something I'm just reminded of how this other issue will still be there and it's like whenever I come up with a solution another problem arises. What's worse is how every time I do try and sort my life out and it fails, which is every time, I become even more disillusioned and deterred from trying again in the future, because it will just be pointless. 

It's pretty fucking depressing that the first thought I wake up to on the start of a new year is how it would be easier killing myself then hopelessly trying to fix my problems. I wish I could just be rid of all this shit and be a normal person, it's fucking scary thinking about how this is how I could be forever.",3,"my crippling anxiety issues, insecurities,jealousy, loneliness, isolation, killing myself"

"Hey guys, long story short I've had a long history of depression/anxiety and I was prescribed Effexor towards the first half of the year (around April I think). Initially it lifted my mood, but very quickly it began to take a toll on me. I found that I felt completely disconnected from my actions, like I was a stranger inside my own body, and more worryingly I lost the ability to really feel any emotion. I've had to imitate behaviours and emotions even though I am not feeling them in order to still seem like I'm functioning. The only real feelings I've had as of late have been bouts of anger and a habit of splurging on stuff I don't need and overeating which I never really did before.

My doctors have been extremely unhelpful and I made the decision two months ago to slowly taper off my dosage. I was on 75mg a day, and I began by opening the cases of the pills (there are six small capsules within a plastic shell) and removing one of the capsules, over time ramping it up to only 3 capsules a day, the equivalent of 37.5mg. One day I decided enough was enough. I cannot be held prisoner with this fucking drug anymore, it's too much for me and I long to feel SOMETHING again beyond anger. I quit cold turkey 8 days ago and it's been rough, really rough.

I'm getting a TINY BIT of feeling again. Over Christmas I didn't really feel much at all, but I felt a bit happy the day after Christmas spending time with my family. My sex drive is beginning to return and my dick suddenly works again. 

As for the withdrawal effects, it's been rough as fuck.  I get ""brain zaps"" which is very common for people coming off Efexxor. It's like a sudden jolt in my consciousness and happens anywhere between 20-100 times in an hour. I can handle that though. I'm lethargic and it's hard to move my hands properly. I'm experiencing a lot of hot flushes and high temperature. I'm sweating balls when I sleep and during the day.

Worst of all is I'm getting bouts of extreme anger. Over time I've become a much more chilled person, but this anger I'm feeling does not feel like me at all. I'm convinced it's withdrawal effects. I get so mad I want to scream at full volume and smash everything around me. I've never consistently felt like this even in the past when I struggled with anger. The slightest thing infuriates me and I'm overreacting to everything.

My family have no idea how long I've been struggling. I made the decision a while ago not to bring it up because it only makes things worse. They made it very clear they want to help and share my issues but when I've spoken to them about how I feel in the past it has scared them and they have been over-protective. I choose not to rely on anybody else and I don't have anyone to share how I feel with so I felt like I wanted to make a post here.

I have become distant with all my friends and family. I felt such a disconnect with life in general at the start of the year that nothing really feels real anymore. I don't care about anything, I don't want to make an effort with anybody and I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about how I feel. I don't feel like anyone would understand. I feel like I'm not meant to be here and that I'm defective and people can just sense it when they're with me. Everything seems to superficial and pointless and nothing gives me joy anymore. I have vivid fantasies of pushing everyone I know away and living alone in solitude and never having to contact them again, starting life over. Even though I'm close to my family and have some very good friends, it never feels like enough and I've lost a lot of close friends recently by cutting them out of my life because they were toxic people.

I feel hazy, I'm sleeping bad and it's hard to focus, but I'm 8 days in and no matter how bad it gets I'm staying off these torturous drugs. Think long and hard if Effexor is really for you. It has become a prison for me and online research has shown me that it's the same for others. I am determined to beat the dependence, but I worry about how long I'm going to feel like this. I can handle a few months, but what if it never goes away? I feel incredibly alone in all of this. 

This is a bit of a trainwreck of a post but it feels a little better to put how I feel into some semi-cohesive manner. Has anyone else gone cold turkey and made it? How long did it take?",3,"prisoner with this fucking drug anymore,  bouts of extreme anger, family have no idea"
"Hey all,

I've been on Lexapro (generic) for a couple years now, no issues.  Currently 20mg dropping to 15mg tomorrow.

This week I started Wellbutrin XL (generic) at 150mg.  I feel good, little wired, but not bad.

I'm concerned with the possibility of seizures. I've brought this up to my doctor, waiting on a response, but I figured I'd get more opinions.

I have no history of seizures, no plans to go above 150mg.

Any thoughts, am I worried for nothing?

Thanks!",3,"been on Lexapro (generic),concerned with the possibility of seizures, worried for nothing,"
