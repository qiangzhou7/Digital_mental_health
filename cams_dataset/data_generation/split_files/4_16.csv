I spent so much time with my friends and they invited me to everything. I invited them to do stuff. We had a great time and we did everything together and talked to each other about everything. Now they have ditched me. I never get invited to anything. It's like they don't know me. I didn't do anything differently they just stopped inviting me to hang out. I don't get it. I'm not even depressed now I am just at the point that I don't care anymore. So now I have gone in one year from being kind of cool with everyone then being really awesome and fun and everybody liked me and I was invited to everything to now not being invited to anything and none of the people that were my friends caring to ask me to hang out. I didn't do anything different. I was myself the whole time. They liked me for years and then the moment I feel like they are my 2nd family I get cut off.,4,"friends have ditched me,  they just inviting me to hang out, none of the people that were my friends caring to ask me to hang out"

I'm so fucking annoyed and tired of feeling like only 1/2 a person all the time, feeling a whirlwind mix of negative emotions but never feeling positive ones except in rare, fleeting circumstances. I don't deserve this. Maybe it's caused by childhood trauma, maybe it's genetics, maybe it's just shit luck, I don't know for sure, but I sure as hell didn't ask to be plagued with social anxiety and depression; I won't allow 2016 and how shitty it was to kill me. Yes, I became suicidal a month into it, yes I hated myself for most of the year and used self-deprecating humor to express how I felt, yes I started self-harming and cutting myself over the summer and did it more or less regularly for the rest of the year, yes my anxiety reached new heights and started interfering with my life and career, but what do I say to that? I'M FUCKING DONE. I have done nothing to deserve this. I've done some regrettable things in my life, but nothing so bad that would make suicide a justifiable decision. I want to taste happiness and ""feeling okay"" for once--and not just that, but for a long time; I know I'm naturally prone to feeling depressed and like shit, but that doesn't mean I need to accept it. Even if I'm going to die, it doesn't need to be by my own hand, at the end of a gun barrel pressed against the side of my skull. I want to have a successful and flourishing career, I want to have fun in my 20s's, I want to experience all that is, I want to fall in love. Deep inside my head, there's still that part of me who wants to sabotage everything I strive for, who wants me to kill myself, who picks up the knife and cuts myself, who tells me I'm an unattractive piece of shit who should die. Fuck that guy. I will not go gentle into that good night. I will rage, rage against the dying of the light. I will make 2017 my bitch.",4," tired of feeling like only half a person al the time,  caused by childhood trauma, may be gentics"
"I don't remember not having this and it's not going to go away.
 Even my boyfriend thinks I'm toxic and I can't count the amount of times I've hurt him, my family, the people I care about over the last year. I've given up on anything getting better. I have a way to stop hurting now.",4,"boyfriend thinks I am toxic, I've hurt him my family, the people I care about"
"She wants kids. I fucking despise children and cringe when one is around me. And I would have to have one around me every day as a father. I'd need to PRIORITIZE THEM over my own life. That's completely horrifying to me.

She's left. I'm right.

I drive her nuts all the time. I can't make her happy when she's sad.

I enjoy living a lazy, quiet lifestyle living off of SSI. I can't provide for a significant other.

I should be happy like this. I should be overjoyed. This way our bond won't be ruined when we inevitably couldn't stand each other any more and have an ugly breakup. 

So, why am I not? I can shrug off most rejections with ""she was too good for me, anyway"", leave it at that, and move on with my life.

So why am I not feeling any better when I can come up with a million more reasons why it would never work out in a million years? I know it's for the best. I've accepted it won't change. But it doesn't get better. It still hurts. And I never thought it would ever happen. My entire life I thought I was immune to this, because I never considered myself capable of falling in love in the first place.

But, here I am. And I still don't know how the fuck I ended up here. I still don't know why what happened happened. All I know is that I regret it ever happened. I wish I could go back in time and restrain myself and remind myself of the life I wanted to have, and not get this close.

But I didn't listen to myself. I foolishly let it happen, thinking it was fine. Never imagining it could come back to bite me later. But it did. I got too close. It got too serious. And now there's hell to pay. I have to carry this weight around for years. At the bare minimum. With therapy. And pills that don't work for jack shit. I may be like this forever. Some say it never truly gets better. It may not hurt as bad. But it's always going to hurt to some extent. And I don't believe people who say it'll pass. I think I'm damaged forever. And it's all because I was too goddamn naive to consider what might happen.

Is this the real reason why major lifestyle differences are such an immediate turn off and cause to break contact for most? Once political views and beliefs and values stop being a barrier, EVERYTHING does. It gets to the point where you want to stand by someone no matter how rotten they become. What vile things they do. Because you're used to doing it. Because you believe it's the right thing to do. And you won't listen if anyone tells you otherwise. It's the cruelest joke in the world- because you find yourself so obsessed and committed, and willing to do anything at all for someone, you can't stop loving them and move on, literally no matter WHAT happens. I could not have less in common with her if I tried. And yet, here I am. Hopelessly in love with someone who is never going to love me back. 

I never want to get this close to someone. Ever again. I don't want to feel pain and shock fresh ever again. I don't want to carry any more burdens around. The fact of the matter is, there's probably only one person in the world I was willing to consider breaking my dreams of living the free single life for. And she's not interested. All that's left for me is the idea and possibility of a life that I always wanted to live. And it doesn't make me happy. I'd give it all up for her in a heartbeat if I could.

Luckily for me, I have surefire female repellent, as if my very existence in and of itself wasn't enough of it. Apparently those of the female race think very lowly of men who pay for sex and want nothing to do with them, and certainly won't date them.

Well, screw 'em. If they don't want to give it to me, I am going to pay for it, in places where it's legal to do so. And then it'll be a damn sure thing I'll never find someone who wants me. Because I am going to tell ANYBODY who gets too close to me what I did. And then they'll make faces and run. I refuse to lie. How can you possibly love someone you're lying to and keeping secrets from? The entire relationship has a rocky foundation waiting to crumble if word ever surfaces. That's why I find it impossible to approach women. How am I supposed to say ""Hello, I am interested in you purely for your body"" and expect it to go over well? Because that's all you know about a girl at first glance. It's the only thing you COULD be interested in. But you can't say that. But lying is bad. And thus... the eternal dilemma. 

I should be happy. I get to live the life I always wanted to have. Going off to have legal sex with prostitutes. Doing whatever I want without any extra baggage to worry about. Knowing it all ultimately doesn't mean anything. It only does for a night. I should be overjoyed. My dreams will soon become a reality.

But I'm not happy. Because it's not what I truly want.

I can't have what I want. It's all merely settling for what I can have. Almost nobody gets to have what they truly want out of life. Even if what they want isn't something atrocious. But maybe it was an atrocious idea all along. Unconditional love doesn't truly exist, and I'm a warped human being who wants to believe it does.

I hope they legalize prostitution in the rest of America, besides Vegas. Maybe this never would have happened if there was just a more accessible place you could go to turn in your virgin card once you hit 18. Maybe I'd have been satisfied with meaningless one night stands with women sooner. Maybe I would have been spared all of this heartbreak and pain, and maybe I never would have gotten as close as I did.

But maybe I was going to anyway. Maybe it was always going to happen, regardless of if I wanted it or not. Maybe it was fate. Maybe fate really exists.

Or maybe none of this actually matters.

First day of 2017 and I already hate my life and everything.

"I've had depression for a while now and I've slightly lost contact with most friends. I decided to throw a party to get back in touch with them. I had a great time before the party. I had pre-drinks with a couple of mates and it was chill, I felt calm and like myself. I should mention that last month I was dumped and cheated on during a long distance relationship that last 7-Months so the girl I'm about to talk about is the first girl I've had feelings for since. Towards the party I wanted to talk to my crush who was invited. We've been friends for a couple of years and in the past month I've invited her to a movie and surprised her with coffee before Christmas. I've been warming up to asking her on a proper date but when the party started. I relapsed. I've been feeling great up to this point. I shut down, I was a shell the whole night. She was surrounded by guys all the time and I didn't even get to say hello let alone have enough courage to. I was isolating myself for most of the night, even when it's my own party. Friend's comforted me and wanted to help but I just shut them out. The countdown to 2017 came and I left to my garage. I didn't want to see anyone. People left around 1:30am and I said goodbye acting really appreciative that they came. I'm happy they came but not during the night, I just wanted to be alone. The next day I apologize for not talking and just let out my feelings for her. She just thanked me for the night and ignored what I said about her. Now my day is ruined because I overthink. 

tldr; Had a party, relapsed back into my old state and didn't talk to my crush. I talked to said crush and she doesn't necessarily care how I feel.",4," lost contact with most friends,  I was dumped and cheated on, I relapsed,  didnt talk to my crush , she doesnt necessarily care how I feel."
"Why is the best advice always to confront them and have your heart be broken and move on, or you are still young, you will find the right person. If you truly fallen in love someone, not just by their physical appearance, it definitely is not something you can simply move on. I have known this girl for 8 years and i am so deeply in love with her, but i know she would never love me back. I consider her my closet friend but i know she does not. I know if i disappear she would not care. We talk almost everyday, play video games, and from time to time hang out as a group, but i know these things mean nothing to her other than a social outlet. The amount of things i have done for her, be there for her when her pet of 13 years passed away, be there when no one else would, go out of my way to help her studies, travel overseas after having a surgery just because she told me she wanted someone to hang out with, all those things i know meant nothing to her. I know that if someone doesn't love you, no matter what you do they won't, I am not spiteful about her not loving me back, i know she owes me nothing but it just hurts so much. She is the first person in my life that when she felt sad, i would feel sad as well, when she is happy, i would be happy. She is by no means amazing looking, but every time i look at her, i would see the most beautiful girl i have seen in my life. I can just spend the whole day looking at her, i can't even imagine loving any other girl other than her. I know she has some personal flaws, but no matter how annoying they are, i still love her the same. The thought of new years have made this experience even worse than it is. No matter how i try to play out a scenario of me confessing to her just to get rejected a move on, it would end in our friendship ending. I love her so much i rather suffer than not have her at all. How am i supposedly suppose to find someone else who is suppose to be right for me when no one can compare to how i feel about her. Sorry for the rant, whenever i am at a new low i hope posting here would make me feel better, at this point i just don't know anymore.",4,"She would never love me back, if someone dosent love you, no matter what you do they wont, play out a scenario of me confessing to her just to get rejected a move on, friendship ending"

"I'm a high school senior and my high school experience has been quite rocky to say the least. Not only am I quite socially awkward and have close to no friends, living with my parents has made my anxiety and depression worse and worse every year.

It's New Years Eve and I'm in my room alone, since they were arguing earlier and I dont have any friends to hang out with.

"I used to have a great social life.  Everyday after school and over the weekends I would hang out with friends, I even had a ""girlfriend"", and when we weren't hanging out we would text.  It was one of the happiest times of my life.  It was great until the next school year.  Our whole friend group was separated into different classes and we all didn't hang out that much anymore outside of school. At the end of the year I found out that my 2 best friends were switching schools, one for personal reasons and one for sports reasons.  When I found out I was devastated and wanted to switch schools for next year also. I looked at the school one of my friends was going to and liked it, so I switched to that school.  Ever since then it seems my life is going downhill.  I have a few close friends but we rarely hang out or text.  I don't understand how they can handle not seeing their friends outside of school.  My best friend lives in another town, so we never hang out, and my other couple friends live in the country far away from the subdivision I live in.  In our classes there is also a huge gender divide, so chances are I will never have a girlfriend through high school.  I spend all the time not at school on Instagram and Snapchat looking at my old friends hanging out and having a good time while I'm feeling alone.

"Too many things have happened in the past few days, weeks, months. My parents lost their jobs, I lost my relationship with my gf and she just moved out yesterday. I had to say goodbye to my father because he's moved away and I don't know if I'll ever see him again because his girlfriend doesn't like me. I'm losing my apartment, I lost my job, my best friend moved away chasing some girl, I'm still a fat piece of shit, but not to get too far off topic.

I loaded my gun and held it to my head for about a half hour and just thought about everything and how completely dead and empty I am inside.

I wish I had someone to talk to. I can't talk to my mom because she would get freaked out about it. My closest friends I can't really even talk to about shit like this either. So here I am posting on the internet about how much I hate myself. I know I'll never really commit suicide, i know I'd rather just float through life and hope something becomes of it. But every day is so hard not to just give up. I've lost damn near all of my friends. I'm getting older and losing time to fix my problems.

"2016 has possibly been one of the worst years in my life, at least emotionally-wise. Yes, I've been progressing with my exams, I even got a part-time job and started saving something, but that's all that I've been doing.

Last February my GF left the country to study abroad. Little did I know, I went to visit her in April and she broke up with me 10 days later. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions since then, and all I could do to keep me sane was studying and working. I didn't pursue any personal hobbies, apart from some sporadic gaming. I've been literally preparing exams and working almost non-stop and most of the time I went to bed very late. My soul has been sucked out; If I didn't have to work anymore and I finished studying, I wouldn't know what to do apart from staying on the computer. This new year poses some early choices I have to make. I want to do my thesis and continue saving money with my job, but I don't want to be working and studying without any free time anymore. I don't know how to live anymore.

I feel like I need help, but I don't want to jeopardize everything like I did with my ex by exposing my insecurities. I feel that exposing my sadness would repel everyone around me.

"I've been seeing my boyfriend, let's call him Danny, for a few months. He's great, a real sweetheart, very funny and smart and communicative. I really love being around him. He's also severely depressed, and has been for years. He's on medication and sees a therapist.

The fact that he is depressed doesn't bother me, lots of people at my university are, and he's had a very hard life so it's not all that surprising anyway. But sometimes he does really reckless shit that I don't know how to react to in a helpful, supportive way. Specifically, tonight (NYE) he went and got suuuper drunk with some friends and wound up eating a bunch of vitamins and then forcing himself to throw up. I know this because after Danny sent me about a dozen completely unintelligible texts, one of his friends took his phone and messaged me to tell me what was up and reassure me that he was okay.

My knee jerk reaction was anger - that he would drink so much when he knows he's not supposed to mix alcohol with his medication, and that he would do something so reckless. I mean, I don't know how dangerous eating a handful of vitamins actually is, but I've heard it's bad and so has he. And he's been very suicidal before, before I met him, so the general behavior just scares me. But then again, he probably was just muching on them because they tasted good and ya know, drunk brain. 

Obviously getting mad and yelling at him or whatever isn't going to help much though. Is there a better way for me to react that still makes it clear that he upset and scared me? Some kind of general rule of thumb for dealing with this kind of behavior? General advice? Am I over thinking it? Is this the wrong subreddit (my bad if so)?

"Well let's start from the beginning so at least someone will know the whole story. I've had depression since I was 8 years old. When I was a kid I was tortured by my entire school. I've been suicidal since I was 12, struggling with addiction since 14 and I am now 23. I've lived my life in a giving manner. Always making sacrifices to help others. I have been feeling lately that I have dug myself too deep to get out. Shit really started to go down hill when I was 17. I was in a happy loving relationship with a girl. It was fantastic we were best friends and shared everything. However she was 2 years younger than me and when I turned 18 her parents called the police. I did 180 days in jail I'm a registered sex offender until I'm 33 and on probation until next February. A little while after I turned 19 I feel in love again with a girl who I had a crush on since the ninth grade. We had a daughter I turned my life around I quit using and for a short period I didn't hate myself anymore I didn't even want to die. God I miss that. I worked nights slept a couple hours and watched my daughter all day while my fiancÃ© was at work while going to school online and managing all of our responsibilities. She left and took my daughter away just before thanksgiving just out of the blue. I tried to get her back. I fought I did everything in my power to get her back but she will not listen. I just want my family back but that will never happen. So tonight I will jump off a bridge into the Mississippi River. I'm done with all of this every time I try to dig myself out I dig the hole deeper. I just wanted to tell someone before I jump to get all of this off my chest and not feel so full of anxiety so I can live my last day with my daughter peacefully.

"I've gone through deep depression in university from being homesick, in addition to being in remission for testicular cancer for over 3 years. I met this girl through a close friend of mine out of state. We met once and connected really well, and wanted to stay together even through long distance. She told me her feelings were genuine and I shouldn't worry about anything, and that she would not be the one breaking up with me.


Fast forward 2 months to last night, where we met up again, to which i feel that she may be avoiding or distancing herself for me. I would ask if everything is alright to which she would assure me nothing is wrong. I see her texting a friend at the show we were at where she sent a text to a friend saying ""I'm a horrible person"". I kinda figured what may be the case, and confronted her to which she slowly admitted that she's not looking for a relationship. She booked the same flight home with me to stay with and visit me where I live with my family.


I don't know where to go from here. I'm 22, been through physical and emotional stress, and I wear my heart on my sleeve too much. I am going to talk to her soon about the situation but I don't know if I want her coming home with me now. It feels humiliating to describe this amazing girl you just met to friends and family, only to be abruptly let down before we could actually spend quality time together IN PERSON. I don't know if i can have her come home with me, it's so heartbreaking to know the person you fell in love with doesn't feel the same and is right in front of you.

All my friends were partying it up and having fun without me! I was so fucking pissed off and sad.

"Every now and then when I feel a bit better and starting to build something in my life. I remember of the past and it ruins my insides.

For most of you, my thoughts might be nothing... it is very important to me.

I come from a very hard family. I grew up to hate alcohol because I saw my father drunk been horrible to my mother. And generally I was socially awkward. Even that, I was quite popular at the Uni. I dont know if it was the the long hair and my exotic colour but I knew loads of women were interested in me. But I couldnt do anything.

And that is what destroys me. As everyone had their crash in uni. What destroys me it is that, some of those crashes that I had, I knew they were interested in me. And I could even sleep with some of them.. but I never did. I was virgin and still was 2 weeks ago. 

Now, I look back at all those pretty women that I liked and I probably do not exist to them. WHen I could be with them if I tried!",4,"come from a hard family, hate alcohol, father drunk and horrible to mother"
"I guess I'll start off by saying that I've been dealing with depression about eight years. It has peaked in the past, but I'd say I've been mostly positive since then. About one or two days out of every month it hits me with reminders that it's still there.


Today is one of those days. I woke up next to my girlfriend (who I absolutely love) and I just feel like I'm always worrying about doing/saying the right thing.  When something bothers me, I tell her. No matter how small it may seem. It just helps me get things off my chest and out of my mind. She hates when I do this, because she thinks I'm trying to pick a fight, and argue over something so meaningless. She tells me if roles were reversed, these things wouldn't bother her. 


So how do I even deal with these thoughts? I can't just hold them back, because then it's obvious something is on my mind. I can't just push it out of my mind by rationalizing it, because I'm constantly worrying. I also feel like there are so many guys that would love to have her. I think if I fuck up and constantly bug her about things, that she'll be closer to the door.

"I want to help my papa, who suffers from obvious depression.

He had a pretty tough life: loosing his mother when he was young, my grandfather made him drop out of high school to start working and earn money to leave in the house. He worked from 16 to 45 years.

He had a meaningful job where he met my mom, who left the company a few weeks after starting dating him. At some point he was ""promoted"" but not really, and left the job shortly after.

Long story short: he popped from job to job until 45 yo, and have been unemployed since. My mom works and earn enough money to feed us (although some months this becomes an issue), but her job takes her away from the family for like 2 weeks straight sometimes, which obviously she hates.

At 55, and unemployed for 10 years, my dad feels depressed and guilty for not being able to give my family a better life. He tries really hard to look like he is ok, but he is depressed like noone I've ever seen.

I can't do much by myself since im in college and haven't found a job yet. My brother has, but he prefers to take his SO in vacations.

"Im a normal Joe, have a good life, no real problems, look just like anyone else.  
  
Yet I hate myself so much. I have no energy for anything anymore. I usually sit in a chair by my computer watching my screensaver thinking of what to do with myself. I wanna watch a movie to pass time, but i find watching movies too boring to even bother.  
  
I work out at a gym and have for a few years, its a routine i enjoy while doing it but as soon as i step outside im all down again.  
  
All I want is love, a girlfriend, someone special. And I have tried. A lot. I ask girls out, I hit on them going out. I casually talk with girls I meet. But all I've ever gotten is rejection from those Im interested in.  
  
I have no motivation for anything, literally for anything. I should see a psychologist I guess but it costs money and it's a hassle to get to one so I postpone it.  
  
I dont see any point in anything anymore, I have no motivation. I find the few friends I have boring and cant bother with them anymore. I cut all the good ties I have because I dont find any joy from them so soon I'll be all alone, but I have felt that way for a while now already so there wont be a real difference.  
  
I see no point in bothering with anything anymore, nothing brings me joy anyway. The only one thing giving me happiness is the dream of a girlfriend, a relationship with love, but all I ever get is rejection, and Im probably not sending very good vibes so can I really blame them?  
  
Im not suicidal, I dont believe in God or afterlife so not living is a waste. But right now my life is just as much of a waste.  
  
I dont expect any answers here that Im not already aware of, I just felt I had to talk about this with someone, and right now *you* are the person I feel I can talk about this with.  
  
Needless to say, I need help. But I dont see how anything could help me really.

"So I was married for 8 years, got cheated on the whole time. I pretty much knew it but didn't do anything about it cuz how do you really make someone stop. I tell myself I stayed for the kids but really I think it was just so I didn't have to crawl back to my family. With her I have 1 kid. She had one when I got with her. Then some how we got guardianship of another. But legally I think I'm only reasonable for the 1. I dunno. 

But anyway we have been separated for a few years now. I still live with her for the same reason. Still married to her unfortunately. Wish I had the money for the divorce. So I sleep in the living room while she is with another guy. That doesn't bother me at all. She cheated on me though that I didn't even care when we decided to split up for good. 

I can't get a job right now cuz when I try to she does something to make sure I have to watch the kids instead. Like leave town for 4 days. Her boyfriend refuses to watch them. So I'm such at the house. 

I barely talk to my family cuz of some issues we had a few years ago. Read my posts and you will know. So they won't help me out. 

I never get time to myself and when I tell her I want to get out of the house she pretty much threatens to kick me out and take the phone back they I'm using. So i rarely get to go anywhere. 

I wish I was dead most the time. I take a bunch of pills sometimes to try and end it, but then I feel bad cuz of the kids. But I think they would be better off without me being depressed around them all the time.

"I'm not really sure if this is the place to post this, but it shouldn't really matter as it truly upsets me anyways.

Honestly, I've got to be one of the unluckiest people ever. It's coming to be really stupid and upsetting how unlucky I am.

My dad always told me in order for you to be happy, you must be positive. You need to do good things for other people. You need to be a good person. So, I decided to change who I am. 

Over the course of the last three years I've donated to several charities, I've helped in food drives, and much more. When I went to Africa a few years ago, I gave away several supplies and food to less fortunate families living on the beach. Every year, on holidays, if I'm doing something such as getting my haircut, I'll give them a pretty generous tip. (~$20 tip on a $14 haircut)

I used to run a depression help and therapy sessions for people who wanted to end their lives. I've met amazing people and helped many people get past their biggest fears/ problems. Don't get me wrong or anything, I'm very thankful for those experiences and friends I've made.

But really, the last three years of my life have also been the worst time of my life. I lost my first true love. A five year LDR, and we'd finally met in the fourth year. But ya know, of course, she ended up cheating on me with her best guy friend, that I told her I was worried about losing her to. Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯ FML. 

I just started college this year, got very close to my roommates. Felt very fortunate for the new friends I had made. Halfway through the year, we realized that one of our roommates had been stealing our shatter (for dabbing. thc concentrate). Which has account for more than $300 total. He also stole my friends juul (an e-cig), he won't admit to it and of course wouldn't buy him a new one and/ or give it back. The other roommate is very stingy with money, so of course, the generous person I am, I bought him a new one. Mind you I already bought him new juul pods (juice refills) a week prior, because I felt like I wanted to contribute and help him pay for it, since I've used it a few times before. 

This winter break my roommate, the one who owned the juul, let me take it home with me. Of course, at the end of the trip, flying home, I stuck it in my front right pocket and somehow it ended up gone. I always check the seat pocket in front of me and my seat after flying. So, yeah, I'm going to buy him another one. 

Realistically, the money isn't that big of a deal. I mean, I am a college student and my bank account is going down, down, down. However, it's really starting to get to me with all this negative-luck. Honestly, in the past i've wanted to kill myself, and with my luck, I wouldn't doubt I'd accidentally kill myself. 

I don't know how to get this shit to stop, but it's really starting to get to me. I don't understand how I can be a pretty good person, and be so goddamn unlucky; while people like my sister, who are complete assholes, do nothing but strive.

"the last year has been awful for me. my wife dumped me early in the year and moved with our son abroad for a few months. Subsequently, as a result of my bad emotional state, I lost my job. I got kicked out of the house we were renting and later had to leave a flat I rented (neither was financial reasons) and had to move in temporarily with my parents and have slept on the couch in the living room for a few months now, not getting enough sleep and having no privacy, but I have no alternatives. I got depressed and I'm on antidepressants. I also got pretty sick, some significant limitations, surgery was on the table, still might be, but hopefully not. Also, I had the worst phases of tinnitus in my life recently and it drove me insane. I have 2 favorite hobbies that I need my right hand for, but I got a nasty inflammation in my right hand, so I can't do my favorite hobbies. I lost a solid 35 pounds in 4 months because of depression. I felt better recently after being on antidepressants, found a girl that I like a lot and we had a trip planned, long distance relationship. I was looking forward to it for a long time, but I got sick again today and had to cancel and since this was the week when she had time off from work, God knows when there'll be time again. I also worry that I will lose her for some reason now, being pathetic as I am atm. And I feel like that was the last drop. I sincerely don't feel like going on after all of this, there is just no point in anything anymore. I'm so disappointed by getting sick again after struggling with health so much lately. Disappointed by not getting to spent intimate time with this girl again. I spent a month in bed just now and I'm already sick again. Wife started pushing hard for divorce on Christmas eve of all days (we were keeping this for when things calm down a bit, as it's just a formality to us at this point). Today she visited my parents and went full passive-aggressive on me, brought back bad flashbacks. My mom, who's my closest person in all of this... we have a slightly complicated relationship. She's kind of a low key feminist and she has a tendency to take my ex's side by default, identifying with her as she is also a divorced woman and she never entirely dealt with that. She was pretty cold today in communication with me after my ex's visit today and it got to me. And I apparently can't sleep, so I took sleeping pills and I'm starting to feel super sleepy as I'm typing this. Also, I noticed I suffer from forgetfulness and have trouble concentrating or falling asleep after starting to take antidepressants, which scares me. Overall, I'm just not sure anymore. The only positives in my life atm are my mom's support and being able to look forward to spending time with this girl and both things just went out the window and I feel like... what's the point in going on? IDK if there is any, IDK. I have to stop typing now as the sleeping pills are taking over, but just believe me when I say that this isn't even close to everything that has brought me into depression, it was just an awful year for me in many ways. Even with antidepressants and therapy, it's all too much now. Way too much. I find my self thinking over and over again that I don't want to have to do this anymore, I just wanna die. I can't get hospitalized or anything like that for this depression, as I need to financially support myself, my kid and my ex, since I'm the only one making money and I don't have anybody in my environment who could support me in any way in this regard. I just don't want to anymore. I wish I could get 3 or 4 good days, just a break and have things go well for a change. But I've been wishing for that since a long time and yet, here I am.

_________________________________

I have been searching that particular person for years.

But apparently, I seem to be carrying a curse with me.

Every time I feel like I found someone *(and hopefully, not because I am desperate and because sometimes I want to say ""SOMEONE, NOTICE ME!"", and there were indeed times where I felt that she was ""the one"", so to speak)*, then all of a sudden ... **POOF** ... she is gone and out of my life

Could be because she found a spark with someone else.

Could be because that when I tell her who I really am, when I remove the mask to hide what I have to go through everyday, she slowly starts to become distant.

Could be because she was not who I thought she was

Apparently, I feel like I seem to be carrying a curse that whenever I feel like I finally have happiness, or finally have my own sense of peace and tranquility ... everytime that happens, I **KNOW** that it is too good to be true because after a while ... it just disappear and I am back to square one again.

*And this is not just about looking for a girlfriend only. I feel happy for a day and later, I am told that I failed a test or forgot to wash the dishes which later made me up fighting against my roommates. I thought that I found a friend, but later on, I found out that they only want to be with me when they are alone or when they REALLY need me. Or when I feel like I can handle my own emotions, all of a sudden, an accident happens*

It's almost as if fate itself wants to punish whenever I find that short period of happiness and tranquility. It always wants to find a way to take from me.

I have depression so that doesn't help. My doctor has me on meds but nothing seems to work 

I know for a fact ,obviously, that if I don't die before my parents or other family members do I'm going to be alive for the death of them. It's just a really scary thought

I know I'm lucky to stil lhavd my parents as some people lost one or both of them. I just don't know what I'm going to do without them.  Even as am adult I would be so distraught and lost in life without them. It's killing me 

It's something everyone goes through so I hate to feel so shitty about something that will happen regardless

I try to make the most of every second im with them but when I'm with them I can't help but thinking the same thing- they'll be gone one day. It feels impossible to think anything positive and it sucks. 

I don't know how to stop thinking so negative but I pray and wish every day that these negative thoughts would stop flooding my mind so I can actually enjoy time spent with them because they could be gone anytime and I'd regret feeling so sad around them

"For the sake of brevity, I will not go into too many details here, but here are the basics.  Over the past few years, my mother's mental health has deteriorated drastically to the point of suicidal.  It is now at the lowest point and she has tried multiple times to commit suicide.  She had health insurance for when she had her double mastectomy early in 2016 but my father quit paying for it.  If she had health insurance, the doctor said she would have been put straight into inpatient care but instead she was urged to go to outpatient.

I do not have much money as I am currently a college student.

I was fumed and was ready to cry because I was so hungry and just really wanted some ramen. And, because all we've been doing this weekend is going to parties, we didn't have food at home. 

My mom was really annoyed that I was sulking and she asked me why I was feeling the way I was feeling. I just told her that I felt I was a 5 year old that wasn't getting their favourite food for dinner and that I'll be fine after I finish being sad. And then she said ""well maybe if you stopped sulking so much you wouldn't have depression."" after that I told her to fuck off and that what she said was an insensitive thing to say to anyone who was depressed and that she was lucky I'm not suicidal. 

I'm trying to let go of this situation now. Trying to cheer myself up by watching some Graham Norton, which usually works, but now there's this huge tightness in my chest and I can't breathe properly.

My mom has always been, and for as long as she doesn't open her mind up a little bit, she will always be the most frustrating person to talk to about my depression. I'm so happy I'm seeing a therapist, because in all honesty, I have no one to talk to who will understand without being frustrated.",4,"tried cooking ramen, it came out frozen, mom was really annoyed and sulking, said insensitive things "
