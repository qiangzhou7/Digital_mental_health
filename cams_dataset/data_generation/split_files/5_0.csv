"Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I've only now understood the fact that I've socially isolated myself over the last 5 years.  Growing up I played premier soccer on one of the best teams in my state, but quit when I was 15 after making the academy team, a decision I've come to regret. I remained athletic and played for less competitive teams afterward just to have fun with friends and help them improve their play.  By senior year in highschool, I had dropped all athletics and after school clubs.  I didn't have my drivers license or a car, so I mostly stayed at home at night.  During school I ignore my long time friends with the excuse of getting ahead on homework, but when I got home all I would do is play video games, watch random documentaries on youtube, research random shit, try to write stories, and a bunch of other random things that never amounted to anything.
I graduated with no friends.

After highschool I went to college and immediately connected with my roommates.  I became really good friends with one of them that I later seperated from because he did not like partaking in smoking weed, even though he was accepting of it, I distanced myself because I didn't want to involve him in it.  But this indirectly lost me my best friend in college.  I never went out to parties that the frats through, I'd always give some BS excuse not to go, partly because I was scared of getting an underage drinking infraction and losing my license, partly because I didn't want to socialize.  Despite me turning down every party request, I'd still smoke with my friends in small groups, but large parties just made me so anxious.  As time went on, I slowly started seperating from those friends though as well because I kept turning down their invites, not just to parties but to do anything.  It became a repeat of highschool, but it started in my second year rather than my senior year.
I dropped out of college.

College wasn't making me happy, my intended major was biochem (which really interests me even to this day), but the loads of work, lack of friends, and helplessness got me.  I would spend most of my nights crying myself to sleep locked in my dorm room feeling helpless and had nobody to consult.  My grades started slipping once my depressive episodes started lasting whole days at a time where I wouldn't even leave my room to shower or eat, I just kept myself busy playing video games or staring at my wall.  At this point in time I started smoking again to try to help bring myself out of it, but it became too much of a crutch.  I was smoking a little over a quarter ounce every 3-4 days (about 80 USD, 7-10 blunts worth for those who don't smoke).
This is why i dropped out of college, because I didn't want to waste the money until I fixed myself.

This is when my social isolation started.  I had no remaining friends from highschool I kept in touch with, and lost all of my college friends because I would just ignore their messages and say ""Sorry man i got ur message too late"" or ""Sorry man I'm busy tonight with (insert bullshit excuse)"".  Luckily I've gotten my depression under somewhat better control, although there are times where I still can't control them or recenter myself.  But really what it's done is make me feel inadequate.  After months of thinking about it, I think the root of it is that I have nothing fulfilling in life.  I think since I quite soccer, I've never had anything to immerse myself with, I can't find that thing to get me up in the mornings.  I literally snooze my alarm for 1-2 hours a day because I hate waking up...

I guess what I'm really asking is how do I find fulfillment in a life where I feel inadequate at everything I do.  Coupled with that, I've seem to become very socially anxious.

Some other stuff to include to give you guys a full picture, I work as a cashier.  Almost every one of customers loves me because I have such a cheery attitude (I think the reason I'm ok with this is because the conversations i have are familiar, almost routine).  I am the kind of guy to give you the shirt off my back if it'll help u, but wont take a handout if I'm starving.

I have plans to hike the Appalachian Trail (full thru-hike) once i pay off my remaining student debt because I thought that it would help me more than anything to just bring my life back to the basics, food and shelter.  The only activity I do is hiking really, even that I do alone and now that it's winter it's much more uncomfortable.

Any advice is welcome.  Thank you~",5,"social isolation,no friends  college drop out,,no friends,playing video games all the time"
"Like right now. Just sitting here back in my home town during the holidays. Still fighting wicked depression and anxiety, and having to fly back across country in two weeks. 

Just sitting here alone at the kitchen table listening to some Linkin Park style music, sipping on a Stella and I realized how often I get caught in this daze and how I almost enjoy it. 

Like Iâm allowing the pain in. Soaking in it. The music obviously amplifies it. 

I think about the decisions Iâve made that have caused me greater pain. More stress. 

I think about what my future holds. If I can make it until then.

I think about the present. If Iâm meeting everyoneâs standards that they all know of me.

Think, think and more thinking. Sometimes mixed with tears. Sometimes angers. But always with self loathing.

Then I go to bed. Sometimes feeling better. Sometimes worse. Itâs a wicked, and vicious fucking cycle.

Iâm so tired. Speaking in general of course about life.

"I can't stand to do anything else. I always have to distract myself with these fantasy worlds. I hate everything else. I hate being alive. I want to kill myself. I can't bear to do this anymore. My life is just one distraction after another. Everything else makes me too anxious. Too many wasted opportunities, too much wasted time, and too much bullshit in my past to make my future at all worthwhile. I feel so trapped.

"Seriously, just what is the point in living? I can't understand why we're all supposed to live a long life, and why the hell does anyone genuinely enjoy being alive? It just seems like everything you do is just fucking around until you die. Nothing really matters. Like all there is in life is just trying not to be miserable and one day you die. Who gives a fuck if it's at 80 or at 20, it doesn't matter. I've come to accept that I'm never going to kill myself, but what the fuck is the point if all I'm doing is just waiting to die anyway? Get a decent career or live your whole life unemployed and homeless, the end result is the same. I just can't seem to justify trying to enjoy life when all there is at the end is the same no matter what the fuck I do. It seems like everyone's reasons for why you shouldn't kill yourself revolve around the people around you: if you kill yourself you'll make other people sad. But who the hell cares? All the people who'll be sad you're gone are going to die sooner or later anyway. It's all so fucking pointless. I just don't enjoy anything this world has to offer. All the earthly pleasures everyone else seem to enjoy just do absolutely nothing for me. I can't find any reason as to why I should even bother. Life isn't beautiful, it's full of hardship, disappointment and misery. And then you fucking die anyway. Even if the bad times are really as temporary as everyone says, so are the good times. What's the fucking point? Every day is just the same fucking thing over and over and over and over until one day you physically can't keep doing the same thing and you die. How the fuck is there any reason why anyone shouldn't just give up? I'm literally only still here because the idea of surviving a suicide attempt sounds worse than just suffering through another boring day of the same pointless shit. There's no light at the end of the tunnel, unless you see death as a ""light"" and even then, you're just suffering for nothing because you could just end it all today and it wouldn't make any fucking difference. The whole concept of survival just seems so fucking stupid because all we're doing is just delaying the inevitable, whether we're talking about the species as a whole or just one particular individual. What's the fucking point in staying alive? I just don't understand.",5,"what is the point in living, I just dont enjoy anything  "
"I guess this isnât really a stereotype, but I often see depressed people in movies/shows/etc portrayed as a person fighting their depression alone, meanwhile trying to make everyone else in their life happy so theyâll never experience that sadness. 


But ever since Iâve been depressed (roughly 5 years now) Iâve been the most cynical person. I hate other peopleâs happiness, when someone accomplishes something all I do is think about my failures. I obviously am outwardly supportive, but inside Iâm so resentful. I feel like am truly an awful person, I donât remember the last time I was genuinely happy for someone. I really just cannot connect with people on any emotional level anymore. I just feel like alien.


Does anyone else feel this way? Or do you try to make other people happy to make up for you not being happy yourself? Does this help you, as in does other peopleâs happiness help to alleviate yours slightly? 


&amp; also, to people that donât resent other peopleâs happiness, how? All I can think about is how unfair it is that others can be so happy when Iâm hardly staying afloat


I know Iâm asking 100 questions but Iâm just curious as to how people share a common disorder but respond to it in very different ways ",5,"been the most cynical person, hate other peoples hapiness , when someone accomplishes something all I do is think about my failures."
"I've been in one of those disassociation periods for months now. I just checked the group chat that I now leave muted and I couldn't think of many things worse than a night out of regulated happiness, with the countdown, that awful song and people who actually want to go into 2018, with their aspirations and shit. 

Well, one thing worse would be staying home to watch millions of pounds/euros/dollars/whatever being absolutely spunked away on fireworks, right overhead of the poverty/homelessness stricken major cities of the world. How anyone enjoys those things is beyond me. You've gotta feel bad for the animals too, domesticated and wild...

"It's totally arbitrary, and that really isn't a problem (any made-up reason to celebrate is fine) except that it makes me think about how miserable I was last New Year's, and every year as far back as I can remember - which is something I would never otherwise think about.

What's worse, it marks another year during which I was totally miserable.  Every New Year's Eve, I am made to reflect that I felt just as bad over the last year as I did the year before, often worse.

How the fuck can I kill myself without being such a fucking pussy?,5,"fuck up everything, failing or backfiring, hating everyone, uncaring jerks, fucking loser, jumping off a cliff now ,get a fucking a gun, kill myself"
"I know I've probably said this countless times before, but fuck, when I think about the way that I act and speak I just get filled with this hatred and hopelessness. I can't stand myself, I don't know why I'm like this but I'm a god awful person to be around. 

I can't keep up a conversation to save my life, it seems like no matter what I'm just repulsive in every way. Nobody wants to talk to me for more than a few minutes, the amount of times I've been left ""on read"" as the cool kids say, is too many to count. I don't know what I'm doing wrong but at the same time I'm painfully aware of how awkward, unfunny, negative and all around incomprehensible I am. I can barely string together a coherent sentence.

It's like every time I try to talk to someone my mind just blanks and I don't know how to reply, no matter how much time I spend forming my response it's always hard to read trash. I can't do anything right, I'm mean, sarcastic, unfunny, awkward and just plain stupid with an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the worst time. 

I'm just so hopeless, I'm so tired of being me and living with this irredeemable trash pile for a brain. It feels like there's nothing I can do to change or improve, no matter what I'll always be this rude sack of shit that's hated almost universally by everyone around them. I wish I had the balls to end it all and save the world from having to deal with me, I'm so damn selfish for keeping myself alive like this.

"When i lived in the states, i had no healthcare so if i wanted anti depressants and counselling, i had to pay out of pocket. i was 15 when i was diagnosed. my mom was working overtime to support me and my two younger siblings, there was no way she could afford mental health help on her own and she made that clear to me. Now that i live in kenya the mental health resources are even more strained and the stigma is worse for seeking them. when i try to talk to people about how i'm feeling they either make me feel worse or tell me they're sorry cause they don't know what to say. and why should they? none of them are licensed therapists. i'm at a point where i need intense professional help but can't get it so my best bet is to do whatever makes me feel better, no matter how harmful it actually is. ",5,"no healthcare, afford mental health, to do whatever makes me feel better"
"Hello all, I have been feeling down for weeks now and I just check Google just now all the depression symptoms. And I match almost all of them but one. I am still enjoy what I like. Like game (dota 2) and I really love watching movies and TV series. I still have those enjoyment I felt before now.

How can I know if I am really depressed or not? I can't go to get a professional help cause I'm broke as fuck right now. Your help would be pretty cool. Thanks",5,feeling down 
"Depression functions in a way where our percieved ""rock bottom"" always happened somewhere in the past month. The truth is, depression gets worse overtime. That rock bottom that people claim to hit is just an illusion. You are depressed for ten months, feel like you are over it for one month, then sink. You keep sinking farther down into the earth until you reach fucking hell. You keep getting lonelier until  you start getting confused whether you're saying stuff in your head or out loud. You grow to be more disgusted by yourself. Your ugly face, your ugly mind, all your fucking failures, and your stupid fucking ego. You feel more and more guilty, regretting every fucking desicion that you make that makes you the stupid failure that you are. You start to cry so much that you can't cry anymore. Soon people don't help your loneliness, compliments don't cure your disgust for yourself, and success doesn't cure your guilt. And the funny thing is, even that isn't rock bottom.

Fuck all of those stupid idiots who say it will get better, it only proves how fucking unaware they are to the logical decline that is the essence of depression.",5,"rock bottom ,getting lonelier, disgust for yourself"
"I always wear my earphones when I first wake up, when I eat my breakfast, and before going to bed.  basically all of the time. I think my music is my escape from all of this bullshit in life.

"With all these festivities going on, I can't help but grow increasingly cynical and bitter. Greeting 2018 in a mere few hours with complete lack of hope and optimism.

"How can I open myself up more and not have therapy as this sort of gossip session? I want to say that Iâm *feeling* suicidal again, but I just feel odd doing it. How can I make therapy worth more to my brain I suppose? What are good questions or things to say to really lead into that because my therapist thinks Iâm getting better and am learning how to cope but in reality, Iâve become numb and emotionless. I also apologize for formatting, Iâm on my phone.",5,numb and emotionless

"I'll just try to make it short (and fail trying) My problem isn't worth really mentioning, I'm a privileged little shit that doesn't have it nearly as bad as most folks here, I even have a supporting girlfriend from a long distance who is also very anxious and depressed. But it helps a little to write it out somewhere. I've graduated from high school around nearly 3 years ago at this point. I'm 20 years old, highly anxious and I've always felt like a dissapointment to my family in every single way imaginable. I barely passed high school, and I hated myself for falling behind and ever since then it's been going down hill with me feeling like a piece of shit for not being where everyone else is. I didn't apply for any colleges right after high school, I didn't make any plans, for some reason I felt like my life was going to be over after high school. I was never thinking about the future but more so the next day. I put off working for quite some time. The thought of standing there socializing or handling money gets my nerves all riled up so I put it off. My parents weren't gonna pay or help pay for a local college so I was kinda stuck here just deciding to do nothing. I don't know why but it just felt pointless. I don't know what I wanna do for the rest of my life, I don't know if what I wanna do is gonna matter. I'm still gonna be a piece of shit that always makes the wrong choices so what's the point? I don't know it sounds pathetic but I don't know.

I lost most of my friends in this time frame, mostly because I cut contact with them because I was so ashamed of myself for doing nothing even though I had all the means to do something while they were going to school and doing what they were supposed to do. I was running out of excuses as to why I'm not doing anything. So two years go by like this, I numb myself with video games and don't answer any calls. I sit in my room all day every day and do nothing and try not to think about it. Sorry this is all over the place, there was someone I met that I unwillingly became friends with but ended up breaking the friendship with her sometime after her mother died. That left me feeling like a selfish piece of shit for quite some time, to fake being a friend. Also left me feeling incredibly guilty because said person needed support after her mother passed and I was just sitting here being a dick. 

I don't know. I can't get myself to do anything worth while. I get overwhelmed easily and I don't have the energy to jump start everything. The future looks so bleak and empty. Like fuck I can't imagine being 30 years old and still in this position. With each passing day I do nothing, the more I feel like a piece of shit. I don't know where to start. I get too anxious undergoing basic social interactions, getting a haircut feels like a nightmare since I'm infront of so many people and I'm absolutely petrified of running into the people I isolated from. I don't know, I've given myself ultimatums in the past. Last year I told myself if nothing changed by the end of the year then I'd have to go to the military but I didn't end up doing that. I'm just tired of it. It's like an endless cycle. I go out there, try to do something  realize I won't be able to stop working for the rest of my life and have to face the responsibilities of being an adult with so much social interaction and painful weeks. Or I do nothing about it, stay at home and don't be an adult and hate myself over doing nothing about my current situation. It felt good back then having a due date. With the military option back in 2016 it atleast made me feel at ease that I could die if things got too bad. Feels like I'm backing myself into a wall here. I can't do another year of this. I can't turn 21 and still not change, I feel like I'm gonna be like this for the rest of my life. Nothing I do is ever gonna have any kind of meaning either. It's getting harder and harder to find a good reason to live if not for other people. It's not going to get better I'm not gonna change because deep down all my problems come from me and I can't not be me. So it's fucked, I'm what's wrong with my life. Why should I live with that for 60 more years?",5,"hated myself for falling behind, do nothing, overwhelmed easily future looks so bleak and empty, anxious undergoing basic social interactions"
"People are starting try and understand depression a little. But the empathy just is not there for anxiety and ADHD. 

I wish things were halfway as easy as neurotypical people think. 

All people see when they look at me is a lazy failure. Most days that's all I believe about myself. 

I think when people say they want to help and support people who struggle with mental illness and disorders, what they really want is for us to shut up and quietly suffer so they don't have to think about it or see it anymore. 

I talked to a counselor at my university the other day. She didn't pay attention to a single thing I said and only wanted to verify that I wouldn't kill myself. As long as I don't stain the university's reputation it doesn't matter if my quality of life is shit and I end up killing myself after leaving college.",5," lazy failure, quietly suffer,that's all I believe about myself"
"I seriously think not. I feel like people only talk to be if they either don't want me to kill myself or they want something from me. 

For instance I recently got a boyfriend, and he's totally different than who he used to be. We used to be friends for a long time but lately all he wants to talk about it either sex, or the whole ""hey don't cut yourself, there's people who care, kisses!"". Everytime he talks about us hanging out it's about sex, or doing something sexual, and then when we do hang out that's also all he wants to do, and I just feel like he doesn't want to be in a relationship or he even actually likes me, he just wants sex and I'm easy. The rest the time it's like our conversations are some copy pasta crap about how you shouldn't cut or kill yourself. Like it used to be different we used to have actual conversations and now it seems unless there's another person there our real conversations are far and few between. 

Then there's my 'friends' who play games with me online. I'm pretty sure that's the only reason we even talk. I suck ass at fps so half the time I just make the game worse and honestly I can not fathom a single reason why they want be around, even my commentary is just me being annyoing as fuck while I let every one down. I think they just don't want to play alone, because that seems like the only reason I ever get invited to play and honestly I don't blame any of them. Or because they don't want me to kill myself, because the two that invite me to play the most are the two that know.

I seriously just want to kill myself, I honestly think it will be better for everyone, people wouldn't have to pretend to like me, they wouldn't have to suffer through be annoying them, it would be great for me too since I just hate myself so much because I'm such a fucking shit head. But I won't, because I'm a fucking pussy and I won't do it until I get the courage to do it again, and this time I won't fuck it up

"Since my middle school I've developed a ,,mask'' to hide my feelings. When I go out to school or with my friends I ,,put it on'' and pretend to be ok. Even in home I wear it to hide myself from my parents and sister. Only at night (00:00 or 1am) I put it off. Then I cry and memories about hate return. I hate myself. Everything I do. I don't know what to do because I don't know who I am now.
