"Long time lurker, first time poster. Finally got enough motivation to start posting just from the fact that it's a new year and there's no end in sight to this bullshit. Not just my own situation, but this whole planet is turning to shit real fast, too.

To explain the subject line of the post, being on the spectrum is the perfect way to fail in every area of life: socially, romantically, emotionally, financially. Academically could fit in too, but somehow I managed to do well in school, probably from all the excess time due to no social life and being under constant pressure from my parents.

Throw in some chronic health issues on top of that, and no fucking wonder I'm depressed.

There's a really old meme of the Titanic sinking with the caption ""Sometimes the only purpose of your life is to serve as a warning to others""

This situation is a front row seat to witness the pure insanity that is going on as the warning goes ignored. Thanks to the shitty global economy, and cultural shifts, people are delaying having kids later and later. Basically waiting until the last possible moment before infertility. It's well known there's a link between autism and the parent's age.

I am Jack's complete lack of surprise when a family member updates me last week on a couple that had a kid in their 40s and the kid is now a few years old and having... delayed milestones.

Then you see shit on TV like celebrities having kids at almost 50 and acting like it's the new normal and a good idea. Again, total madness.

Not to mention the environmental factors, including the country's increasingly crumbling infrastructure (one word: Flint). Nothing but bad news everywhere...

TLDR - Autism is no fun and the upcoming generation gets to find out themselves",5,"failed in every area of life: socially, romantically, emotionally, financially , academically feel alone"
"So i'm meant to make an oral presentation in the next 4 days... easy right? well i don't want to do it everytime i goto do it i lose all motivation and try to avoid it.


Sometimes i'm asking myself is it even worth it... i mean what will it add to my life...nothing it only makes me a more valuable asset to society a cog in a machine.
I do my best so everyone is happy my feelings or desires are irrelevant.
Society has no place for the weak or unwilling unless you are prepared to be a slave to society and work so you can live you will die.
So i'm studying for what..?
The ability to wake up goto work get home spend 4 hours at most playing games and socializing then goto sleep and repeat?
The accumulation of stress and dissatisfaction renders that a logical life.. it would be irrational to put yourself in that state knowing you are literally digging your own grave.

Yet if you don't do it you die either way ...i'm not strong like most i can't handle as much as others in this society no every society the weak is left to die or used as tools to serve the strong till they die.


I don't want that i don't want to spend my life working a 9-5 job just to get home and distract myself for a few hours before i goto sleep and repeat.
I keep running simulations in my head and the only outcome of that is me snapping and doing something drastic eventually.
one must work to earn their keep and survive but.... we don't have a choice really.

Is it our choice if we live and work to live? No it isn't because if we choose otherwise we are treated with scorn and brainwashed into thinking we are ill or are the problem. we don't really make choices we just do what we are told like slaves.
I'm meant to be comfortable and just accept that though because that's what society is?
I don't want to die...but living like everyone else does that's a fate worse then death to me personally.
I don't want to be given things on a silver platter i want to work but these shackles and the lack of choice that people take for granted are so visible to me.
Truth is we can't do whatever we want even if we are told we can we are just sheep that follow what we are told.
Call this a existential crisis but this society and way of life is malformed...we are gears of a working machine and nothing more.

We drink and eat party and play games and chat with our friends to cheer us up to make us ignore reality i don't want any of that..
I want my freedom to make my own choices and not be bound to the will of others.
I'm considering dropping out of my university course ... i don't want to be like my parents or their parents or the rest i don't want to follow that same path.

Surely i can find a different one right?

I don't know what to do but this existence i have been given is worth nothing as long as these shackles do apply.",5,"society has no place for weak or unwilling, feelings and desire are irrelevent, accumulation of stress and sissatisfaction"
"I'm 20, and a sophomore in college. I struggled with depression in high school, but thought I got over it for the most part. When I'm at college and surrounded by friends, I feel great. But the second I am alone in my dorm, I feel like shit. 

And now that I'm on winter break, that feeling is magnified. I don't know if it's anxiety or depression or a mix of both, but I just feel like trash and I don't want to exist (no worries though; I'd be posting this on r/suicidewatch if i thought I was actually considering acting on that feeling.) I am sad. I don't have friends at home really, and I guess this has me all wondering, am I just predisposed to being sad? Like if I'm only happy when I'm busy and with other people, then is my natural state of being just being a pile of shit? 

And does anyone else ever feel this way? I'm good as long as I'm distracted I guess. But when I'm on break, all I do is lay in bed and fuck around with the computer or video games. I have nothing to do or think about, so the things I end up thinking about are all negative. I don't hate myself or anything; I'm just sad and don't really wanna be (be as in exist, not as in ""don't wanna be sad,"" i now see how the syntax there mighta been confusing) (though ideally i wouldn't be sad either) (lastly feel like i gotta say it one more time: seriously am not gonna kill myself. Feel like I gotta make a disclaimer on that).",5,"dont have friends at home, only happy when I'm busy, really sad, dont wanna exist"
"My car needs a new steering pump.

Not really sure exactly what this is going to entail or what the goal here is, but I'm just going to explain my situation because I feel like telling someone will help me in the short term while things happen.

I'm a 25 year old male living in Vancouver, Canada. I'm basically a hikikomori if you know what that is, though not as bad these days. Roman Catholic mom(fairly devout), agnostic dad. 7 child family. Went to a catholic private school grades 1-7(and about half of 8 or so{I believe because of money}). I've always been fairly shy and introverted. I've had depression since I was about 13-14. It feels like manic depression, I can't be sure though because I've never seen anyone about it. Suicidal feelings from around 15-now. (not as bad now, but still scary sometimes)

I had lived in a fairly small town from when I was 6 to about 12, when my family had to move due to my dad being laid off. We never had much money. I'd had some decent friends and a pretty normal life there. I was happy. I went to 4 seperate schools(including a small stint of home schooling) immediately after this through grades 8-9 due to moving around, and ended up going into a pretty good public high school near me. 

Due to my introverted tendencies, the constant changing social environment, and making some progress with relationships that were cut off when I had to move again I think I just stopped wanting to make relationships with people.

I stayed at that school from 9-12, didn't have any serious issues. Never made any real friends. People tended to like me if they talked to me at school, but I wouldn't want to deal with most of them outside of it at all. We only had 1 computer in the house at this point, and I spent as much time on it as I was allowed. Through my mom's love of lord of the rings and her discovery of irc and nerd chat rooms, I eventually came to play a game called guild wars, which is amazing and you should play it. Not 2 though.

Anyways, while playing this game I met a guy and eventually bonded with him over just general internet things and general philosophy kind of stuff. We became pretty good internet friends and he was my only real friend I felt I had from something like 15-19. He proceeds to get girlfriend and as a result he finds he wants to spend most of his time working on his life in their relationship. I grow sort of bitter towards him since then. We still talk but it's just bullshit and it makes me hate myself and him for not being honest I guess. bromances are hard.

I lived with my family up until july 2016, when I moved into a top floor rental suite with a brother and sister. They're both constantly going out/bringing people over and it's annoying for many reasons. I had to use my credit card to pay for rent for the first few months, and have a bit of debt as a result. I've never been good with job stress and just holding a job for long periods, but I'm currently working at a sorting/shipping warehouse. It's not bad but it doesn't pay all that much and it's been stressful lately, I've been considering just walking out and hoping to god welfare will accept me if I see a counsellor or something. I have a small amount of money saved that could almost pay off the debt and leave me with nothing if I use the tax return from this year, maybe. 

I've had other friendships and relationships of various levels of seriousness, all mostly around not serious and just bullshit, in the time since. Not really in the last few years because of what ends up happening with them though. Whenever it ends up becoming somewhat serious which usually ends up happening, someone(often myself) can't handle it and has to go.

Over time I've just become less and less interested in having any sort of relationship with people. They're all shit when you get down to it(I know this isn't really how it is, but it's how it feels, socially). I hate people. 

The resulting state of my mind is not good. I'm terrible lonely and constantly think of how it might feel to actually have someone that I could love. Every day I constantly feel like I should just kill myself as it doesn't really matter in the big picture, but I feel to guilty because i'd hurt too many people. So every day I'll say I wish I could kill myself today but I can't. I have nieces and nephews and a mom that would be devastated. I'm lucky to have a single person that I actually also met on guild wars, that I can still talk to seriously and consider a friend even though I'm not sure how close. I might be dead without him. 

It's just that in this new house, without my parents. Without that 1 close friend I'd had on the internet in high school. Without any meaningful relationship with a girl ever other than 1 or 2 botched online ones, I'm so fucking lonely.

Every day it gets more unbearably lonely. I've smoked pot since graduation, walking to a grad party some ""friends"" had some alcohol/pot, and had always been sort of pressuring me and I'd been turning them down. I decided it was grad party time and fuck it, I'd wanted to try drugs for a long time anyways. Pot is amazing and has helped me a lot, but relying on it in times when your depression gets this bad and you need to constantly smoke more and more, it starts to just make you feel worse after a while if you don't do anything else/figure something out. I'm cutting back and trying to do something about it but when you've been on the internet this long and hate people this much etc there's not much I want to do except have someone that I love and who loves me. Which I will never have because that person can't possibly exist, and I wouldn't meet them if they did, and they don't deserve to have this broken piece of shit tied to them if they did. 

What I hope for is that I'll end up leaving this job, getting on welfare, rent my own place somewhere cheap and start drawing/painting doing other stuff I've wanted to do. Open up to people and find a girl that I could be serious with forever. One day support myself off of something that I like doing. 

I don't really know what I need to be happy, I just know that I'm definitely not right now. I know that it would definitely help to have a relationship. I can't go out seeking one in the state that I'm in right now though. I'll continue going on not killing myself. And being paranoid and hoping that things will eventually get better and the balance will tip. I don't know. :(

There's a lot more that I've left out because I don't want this to legit be my life story.

TL;DR: basically my life story. 

ask me stuff I might answer

my name: I've seen ""man wipes"" where I work, and they're the first funny thing to came to mind when every other throwaway account name I thought of is used. It made me happy for a second.

if you're a cute girl that wants to talk/thinks they might like me/is in the same boat or whatever, send me a pm. I don't know if I'll answer, right now probably not. but I hope maybe I will? Let's make a new character and play guild wars please. Ignore my confidence issues.

"I'm on a mobile and first time posting, long time lurker. 

So for that past two years I think I've been depressed, I've had to deal with a lot of losses. 
I thought and truly believed I was just 'tired' someone mentioned that I have zero motivation and zero interest in anything any more. 
I used to be the type that would rant and rave about the latest book, I couldn't tell you the last time I had an interest in a book. 

I work full time, come home and go to bed. I don't eat, I barley have a conversation with my family anymore and have 1 friend who I see once or twice a month. Other then that I lay in bed, in the dark and cry. 

I'm ready to get help, I don't want another year to pass me by, I want my old self back. 

Can anyone help with how I can speak to my doctor  to about this, how do I open up? I've never actually said these things out loud as I have no one to speak to 

Thank you in advance for any help I can get! ",5,"zero interest and zero motivation, work full time, barely have conversation with family, lie in bed in dark and cry"
"All my life, I have been a sycophant trying to be better, because I can't find it within myself. I don't want to be this person, but I don't know how to stand up for myself and fend for the person who I want to be. It's gotten me nowhere. I feel like I am so far behind and get caught up in the past. I need to be someone better, and I need to stop sulking. I feel that every time I try to get better, someone does something petty to set me off, and because of this, I have fallen  into avoiding people. I don't want to be this person, and I'm so scared that I'm falling into a slump that I won't be able to pick myself out of.

"So I have been in depression for almost more than 2 years now. At the start of the those 2 years, I quit my job and literally spent 2 years sitting at home. 

Now I want to get back to life. However there is a constant thinking in my head that I am a loser. and that I have not achieved anything in life. which makes me wonder what should I do now. 

All I see is the darkness. I have started to believe that I need to get out of depression first before thinking anything about the career. Is that approach okay ???. If yes then can someone please guide me how to move forward ? 
I have already expressed myself on this subreddit the past week and the replies i got were encouraging. However I now think that there is a phase or gap between the mind filled with depressive thoughts and the optimistic mind looking for something for the career. I am 27 and will be 28 in 7 months and I want to transition from the former to the latter as soon as possible. can someone help me with that ?

"I wanted to hear some opinions on a decision that has been bothering me for the past few months. No one I've asked irl seems to want to tell me what they actually think, just telling me to decide on my own.

I'm a sophomore at university, and I've been severely depressed for about two years now. Over the last year, my depression has gotten worse and worse. This last month of school, I didn't go one morning without crying, I constantly just wanted to go home. For whatever reason, being at school, being at my apartment in my university town, is miserable for me. 

My counselor suggested that if I wanted, I could take this spring semester off with medical leave. 

I don't want to stop school. I know it wouldn't be a ""failure"" to take a medical break, but it sure feels like it. I can't even imagine a future in which I don't go back to school. I don't know what I would do with myself at home. Lounge around in my tiny town and work retail? I don't know if that would help me at all. 

On the other hand, this December was easily the worst month of my life. The last two weeks of school I had to fight every day to get up in the morning; just walking across campus without wanting to break down and cry was a struggle. I know university has become this negative space for me, and I guess it would make sense that I get away.

I don't want to leave school, despite all of this. School is the only thing I really have. I don't have any activities or friends. I go to school, go to the gym, do homework, and sleep. Once school is taken away from me, I will have nothing. Maybe it is a blank slate that I need? But maybe once this is taken away I truly will cease to be a functioning member of society. 

I'm scared that if I leave school, I won't find my momentum again, and I won't ever go back. But if I go back and it's anything like this December, I won't make it. 

I really don't know what to do.

"If you dont believe in Karma, you will after this story. This is a story of my year of how I lost everything that makes me happy. I have never been good around people... I mean awkward around others. I hate being this way, but society will not let me change. I try to but I always end up here... ALONE. I had it all until Jan. 2016. So like I implied before, I never had many friends in reality but I did online. I played Xbox a lot (too much) but it was where I was happy. I had an adequate amount of friends there, but I had taken it all for granted. I treated my friends on Xbox like shit. They were the best friends I had but pride consumed me. On one bad day, I had been informed we do not have unlimited internet anymore.This was devistating because the happiest moments of my life was here. This was in January when this had happened. I managed the best I could. This hurts me the worst because this ruined my dreams of being a gamer on Youtube. We still had internet but limited.
      So the month is now March, I have met a very beautiful girl, and I wanted to ask her out but I didn't want to rush anything ( This was an excuse because I was scared). I tried to gain the courage to ask her out everyday. So lets skip to next month (April), I finally gained the courage and did it. The answer was maybe. I should have just given up there, But I was in denial. She manipulated me for a month until she said no. Life was living hell for awhile.
     So after I tried to get my life together, the month is now June. I was now going to pursue my Youtube dreams. I was blindly happy for awhile. I told myself me videos were good... looking back I lied to myself. With limited data means limited quality. The only subs I got was my friends. After about a month of regular posting, my videos got a little better. I was somewhat happy until I lost all of my friends on Xbox. I know I am the only geek who had best friends on Xbox but they were. I don't blame them. I treated them like shit.  After this I just lost all hope and care. I posted about 2 more videos then I lost all my motivation. I was truly ALONE.
     After this I started to learn more about programming. I love computers. The more I learned about programing, hacking, etc. the more alone I felt. Around this time school started so I couldnt program as much. I absolutely hate school. They say High School is the best years of your life, but I say Bullshit.
     So time passed and the time is December 2016. I still played games but not as much. They are the only thing that made me happy. I see it as alcoholics have boose and I have games. I was so alone that I played cs:go in offline mode. Cs:go took up too much data so I didnt want to play online. I felt invincible online at times when I was programming. One dark day my pc gets hacked. I lost over a years worth of code. Ironically at this time I was making a very strong firewall that was almost finished. The hackers stole the code for my firewall program. I had to get a new OS         (operating system). I lost my games too. I cant get them back either. I am left with nothing.
      This is the conclusion of this story. I am not going to commit suicide. I do feel numb and emotionless. I smile and laugh sometimes but it is just a mask of numbness. This is my story of 2016 and how all this contributed to my depression. I do have few friends outside in reality but I had really good friends online too. I am lost in life now. I do not have dreams anymore. I do not know what to do. I wrote this because I have been keeping this bottled up for the whole year. I take full responsibility for my actions and I think I deserve what has happened to me. Hell I treated my friends in reality like shit too.  I thank you for reading this.

"I don't know how much more I can take. I've been depressed for years, tried half a dozen kinds of medication, been in therapy for 6 months (tried multiple therapists) but it just doesn't work. Every time I think I'm making progress, I'm quickly reminded I'm wrong. 


I have no friends. Not real ones. I can't remember the last time one of them initiated contact with me, not on a normal friendship level. I'm everyone's sounding board. I listen to their problems, I offer sympathy and advice, and they go on their way. I have nobody to talk to about my problems because they've all go their own stuff. They wouldn't care anyway. I always have to make the effort and then get nothing back in return. My boyfriend says his friend like me, but that's only because I'm dating their friend. 


I know nobody 'deserves'  friends, but I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I try so hard. I put in so much effort to be there for everyone whenever they need. I try to be fun and engaging and talk to people about their interests even though they never show an interest in mine. For example, I won a pretty big prize related to my hobby last month. Everyone knew about it, nobody cared. If my friend won an award, even in something I don't care about, I'd at least be happy for them and congratulate them. But no, nobody even pretended to care. 


I keep thinking if only I was more attractive, people would like me more. Attractive people have friends, right? If only I was smarter. I know I'm smart, but maybe that's not enough? Am I not funny enough? I travel a lot but make a conscious effort not to be obnoxious or pretentious about it. I don't post 200 selfies from my trips or anything like that. My hobby is slightly unique, but still something anyone should be able to relate to. I'm up for anything, I'm adventurous, I always put on a happy face. I just don't understand why my friends keep rejecting me. Whenever I try to make plans someone comes up with an excuse to bail. 


I've tried making new friends. I moved to a completely new city a couple of years ago to try and start fresh, but the cycle continues. 


A few years ago I was supposed to be my best friend's bridesmaid in her wedding. She demoted me from bridesmaid without telling me (I had to find out through Facebook) and then I wasn't even invited to the wedding. And I still don't know why. I've thought about it so many times and I can't think of a single reason for that to happen. She's still 'friendly' with me, so no, there was no fight we had, not even a mild disagreement. Literally nothing I can think of that would have caused that. 


Then a few weeks ago an out of town friend guilted me into letting her crash at my place even though my apartment is way too small and it would be a massive inconvenience. It was super short notice but I felt bad for her so said yes. She never responded to my reply, never showed up, haven't heard from her since. 


I wish I was just being intentionally obtuse but I... Just don't know why I drive everyone away. I wish I knew what I was doing wrong so I could fix it. 


It doesn't help that my mother has replaced me with my nephew. I understand she's excited about being a new grandma (15 months) and I love my nephew so much, but literally every single photo of me has been removed from her house and replaced with my nephew and sister. Not an exaggeration, all of them, even my baby photos. 
Again, I don't know why. My mum and I have a good relationship, hell we're away on holidays together right now! 


I'm at the end of my rope. I don't know what more I can offer people. I don't need a best friend, I just want someone to like me. I'm very lucky to have my boyfriend, he's great, but it's unfair to place all my emotional needs on him. I just want a friend. But it's like I'm not meant to have one. 


I'm so unhappy and don't know what to do. I want to know what I'm doing wrong because I can't keep living like this. I'm on holidays so I should be happy but I can't stop crying in the bathroom.

"Hey everyone. Still horribly depressed here. Lately I've been lurking subreddits and searching the internet on ways to improve my situation (something I spend a lot of my time doing, likely to the point of counterproductivity), and I can't help but feel terrible after doing so. 
        
My main problems are things many of you are also probably familiar with; i'm depressed, have a rock-bottom self esteem, have suicidal thoughts, ect. The issue I have that trumps (and is likely the cause of) all the others is that I'm socially awkward and suffer from social anxiety. 

I have terrible social and emotional issues. Honestly, this makes me feel like I generally suck as a person, and mixed with depression, is objectively true.  Worst part is, I'm 21, an age where the vast majority of people have either already toppled these kind of issues in adolescence or were successful enough in being people that they never experienced them. But me? I'm fucking lost. Well, not lost necessarily, but hopeless? I know what I need to do to become confident, stable, likable, successful in my endeavors. Problem is, when I see how much work I have to put in to actually become a decent person, realize the sheer gravity of the change that has to take place for me to be the person I want to be and the literal year(s) it might take, I start to wonder if it's really worth it. 

I have no friends. Let me go a step further and say I have no real human connections.  This is not because of other people. It is because of me. Who I am fundamentally as a person, the result of my life and culmination of my personal reactions to my life's events. I have never been confident and social, and thus have never known what it's like to truly live. Twenty one years of never truly living is twenty one years wasted, and I don't know if I can go on. There are so, so many things about me that need fixing. I have to work relentlessly to reverse the damaged/incongruent person I've become. The thing is, most people don't have to worry about any of this shit. Even a lot of depressed people have friends, significant others, and get over their ailment with relative ease. Me? I can't even fucking have a conversation with someone. I don't know if I'll ever be the person I want to be, or grow to love the person I already am; It would take too much time and effort to do either. I'd rather just end my life now and save myself the pain.",5,"horribly depressed, looking internet to improve  situation, terrible social and emotional issues, have no friends, no real human connections"
"I got a guitar for myself this Christmas. My family kind of ignored me this year for Christmas, but that's par for the course....Either ignore or belittle me, one or the other. Anyways. I started playing again. It was a random idea, honestly, a 'good day', where I passed the local music store and saw one in the window. I'm broke, to be honest, but I figured I'd stop in and talk to them to see if they had any cheapies. 

What do you know, my old music teacher was in there talking with them. I haven't seen him in four years, and back then I was okay. Fuck, I was more than okay. I was a greek god for all I was concerned. He actually didn't recognize me, not that I don't blame him. I've gained a bit of weight and I have a bad habit of not taking care of my hair..After talking to him for a little while, and explaining the new idea, he said that he was actually here to sell his guitar. He said if I wanted it, it was mine, so long as I promised to play it pretty often. It's not new or a beauty, but it meant a lot, especially since I look like unmotivated scum.

Anyways. There's my hope for the day. I've been playing that.

I'm just wondering where to start really. I would Ike to be more sociable and let me positive traits shine if i even have any. I compare myself to people I see online all the time but struggle to see normal people who have it worse off than me. I have bipolar to make it worse and about every year I will go off the rails and usually end up in hospital. I've avoided jail by the skin of my teeth some of the time.

"Hi I don't know what the hell is going on. Today I have woken up becouse of my phone clock. I turn first of them off and went to sleep again. I'm always set few clocks to have 100% chance of woke up. After 3 clocks I turn every single one off. I don't wanna get up. I wanna just lie in my bed for all day but after few minutes i get up. I feel extremely stressed and bad. I don't have any tests today and anything that could stress me so what the hell? Why am I feeling this way?

When i'm in school nothing bad I think that would happen happened but I still feel bad. Even through ppl talk to me, nothing bad happen I feel worse and worse. Then I have suicide thoughts. Realy big. Actually I may do this, there are so big if they haven't ended after some time. They and bad mood ended when I have nice conversation with friend about makeing cover of Sepultura song. I suddenly stop feel bad and feel happy for few minutes. The thoughts ended but after I came back to my house, when I'm alone I feel bad again. What the hell is happening to me?

"Hey, so I have had depression for as long as I can remember. (Honestly for more than 8 years, I'm only 20 so that's a while!). Anyway I think its better or at least subsided now. What I needed on dark days is just to speak to someone, i didn't care who it was but i couldn't. (There was no one for me). So i want to change that for everyone else.

"Hi folks, it's my first time in this sub. This is my main account, though i am not a very active commenter, i ussualy lurk reddit everyday. I guess i should be making this posts in a trowaway, but i think i'll end up forgetting this one, so i prefer to use my main and i think i'll better be plain and transparent in this but not getting also too much into detail in the public thread, so i'll start introducing myself. My name is Victor, i'm from Spain and 30 y/o. The last 5-6 years for me have been utter downhill. I feel i lost everything i cared for in my life. My house, my relationship, jobs, friends... sometimes i think i am kind of a reverse King Midas, in the sense everything i touch becomes shit (again, not giving many details on public just in case, if you're interested just pm). I would really like to turn this situation around, i'd like to fix all the things that are wrong with me (and i am already working on this but its not going to be fast), and i would like to talk to people without being all gloomy or have to fake smiles. In the beginning i was capable of that, telling some jokes, faking smiles, making everyone think i was allright and break crying when i was at home alone, but recently since i moved back to my parent's this has become harder and harder. They are great, and my brothers too, but i really can't put more weight on their shoulders. Sometimes i feel like i only need someone who i can talk to, trust, be a little understood or share my feelings without being judged or told things like the usual ""you'll get better, yay!"" kind of thing.
I do freelance work from home, not earning much and not having many opportunities to meet people or pay for professional help, and i don't really know how to start getting out of this situation. The best thing i could come up was this post so you can figure out how lost i am in that sense.
Any recommendations on how can i approach meeting new people and possibly get all the things off my chest in order to regain some confidence in myself and hopefully be back on track?

**TL; DR:** 30 y/o, life fucked up, no friends, need to talk to someone but can't figure who, how or where to begin.

"I'm so confused and fucking afraid. I've always been lonely,  but I accepted it as a kid. That no matter how hard you try, there are just some people who will always be the black sheep. I was fine with it, even though I didn't like it.

But now, I really want to end it. You don't understand, I have this need to run something sharp across my throat, to set myself alight... I feared death to the point where I was scared of going to sleep because maybe I wouldn't wake up. But I can't do it, I can't do it because suicide would shame my family so much that it would destroy my family.

"I'm 6'4"", 36 years old, and have the typical dad bod physique, so it's been as long time since I've taken a bath.  It's just not practical in the least. As I type, I've got maybe a third of my body actually submerged, and that's just how it goes for large people in a typical tub. 

Anyway, that's not at all the point of my post, I just wanted to give some frame of reference for my state of mind. Today I've reached a new low, I feel utterly hopeless, sad, and lonely. So much so that some primal urge to crawl back into the womb prompted me to draw a bath in an attempt to find some basic comfort. 

I'm married and have a 6 year old daughter; my daughter just knows that mom and dad fight a lot, which is bad enough, so I'm trying to spare her in any way I can manage. It's impossible not to let depression impact a close family relationship, even when it's the single most important relationship in your whole life.  My wife has struggled with depression herself, but she's little help in this situation, and often only serves to make it worse. 

As I sit here in the tub, mostly exposed to the cold air, partially submerged in rapidly cooling water, I'm trying to figure out how I even got here. Did I really make such poor decisions in my life? Is everything that has brought me to this state entirely my fault? And that's when it hit me; the ultimate analogy for life as it applies to my current situation: Life is a journey. This is not a new metaphor for life, and all of what just occurred to me has likely occurred to many others, but it was an important revelation that I at least wanted to share. 

Life is a journey, we all have to make choices that determine where we'll end up; our ultimate destination. I have always known that I've made poor decisions in my life that have put me on a more difficult path, but I've also had circumstances outside of my control that have also had significant impact. Some people are fortunate enough to have support and guidance in their journey, from people who have done well or been lucky in their life choices. That's wonderful, I envy that tremendously. 

For those of us who didn't have that benefit, it means flying blind a lot of the time. Imagine that you are driving somewhere really far off that you've never been to before and all you've got is a super vague map with most of the route completely missing. Sure everyone's life is like that to a degree, but some people have those they can ask for directions, people who are invested in their successful journey. A lot of us don't have that, so every turn is a roll of the dice. Some get it right, some get it wrong, some find immediate disaster. 

I feel like the last fifteen years or more, aside from having my daughter, almost every single decision has made my journey more and more difficult, and taken me further from where I want to be. I feel like a refugee in my own life.

In the analogy of life being a journey, there is no going back and making course corrections. I can't go back to the intersection of Work and College and make a different choice despite the circumstances, I can only try to keep going towards my destination and hope to find that intersection again. You can only move forward, there is no going back, so it's easy to just get completely and utterly lost. 

Now, as I've said, I know I'm here because of my own poor decisions, but is it fair that I be stuck here indefinitely? I don't have people I can ask for help. I don't have resources to pay somebody to care about my well-being.

I am in the middle of a place I don't want to be, scared to death, and have no idea how I'm going to get out of here.",5,"depressed, want comfort, married  , 6 year old daughter, wife struggling with depression too, want someone to take care and talk to"
"Hi everyone.  
This is a throw away.  
I don't know if I have the right to say I'm depressed because I mostly think that I'm making it up in my head.  
There are some times when I'm fine but then I get really sad moment every 2 weeks and every 2 or 3 months everything becomes really dark and I just stay in bed for days. Sometimes I think of killing myself a lot, I really dream of doing it, sometimes I plan it, but I never did anything close to it. Just self harm or eating to the point where it hurts, sex addiction, drinking, smoking.  
I never was in a relationship, no man ever said they loved me until I was 26 years old. I had given up on it by then and I had decided to write all my goodbye letters and go on a trip to NZ and die there.  
But then I met a guy I really liked spending time with, and he told me he loved me, I couldn't believe it but after a while I felt it too, or let myself feel it too, and we've been dating since. After that for the first time in 10 years I felt quite good and took up new hobbies and was seeing a future for myself. All this time I still felt that there's something wrong with him for loving me, but I was able to enjoy it while it lasted.  
We're still together now, but I want to leave him. He didn't do anything wrong and he is still great but I feel like I'm a weight and just the worst person to have feelings for. I don't understand his love. He is blinded by I don't know what. What can I add to his life? Absolutely nothing. Just negative things. I want to sabotage this whole thing or ghost him.  
I'm really lost because in the past I have been able to see what I was unsatisfied by in our relationship, he has also brought up some things I was doing badly and all these things have been talked through and worked on and corrected. But now I just want to be alone and stop suffering, the fact that I'm weighing him down is just another thing making me sad. I want to be cold to him so that he finally leaves.  
He is trying to be supportive but I don't want to ask for his help anymore. When his presence doesn't help, both of us just feel worse. And I don't think another person can fix/heal me so it's pointless.  
  
Sorry for this long rant. I guess I was just hoping to see if anyone has ever felt this before?  
  
Tl;dr: For the longest time I was convinced that I was unlovable (and still am despite his love), but now it turns out I am unable to love as well. Does this ever get better?

"I don't even *know* what to say, I'm only posting here because I don't have anyone in real life to talk about these feelings with. Well, other than my girlfriend who can only say so much to help. She's a good sport about it at least and never complains about me complaining. 

I just feel very hopeless. I'm 23 and haven't accomplished too much yet in life. I dropped out of college a few years ago and honestly have no desire to go back. That's the thing, I have no desire to do anything. I don't get it. I take the medicine, I talk to my therapist weekly and learn ways to manage negative thoughts but it all feels very bogus to me. I see no point in doing anything that doesn't offer an instant reward. I see people around me who are so passionate about so many things in life but I've never been genuinely passionate about anything, at least not for very long. My interests come and go. I hear of people getting over their depression but I have a hard time believing that I'm going to just **get over** what I feel is a huge part of who I am. I have memories as far back as age 5 and even before and I always remember being nervous and anxious and having this feeling of constant impending doom. I know this sounds negative but I genuinely think I was just born with a brain with faulty code. I like computers and know that sometimes things just go wrong and you have to hit the reset button, but I can't reset my brain. I don't even know where this is going or why I'm even posting.

"I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience, and how they handled it.
I an 32 years old and I have a mix of anxiety and depression, and often find I am really only feeling ""ok"" when I am at work of asleep, especially in the winter.  This winter I have been really lonely, having pushed away/ been pushed away by most of my friends (getting older is a bitch.  I used to be a popular guy, now I'm pretty isolated and lonely).
So, lately, I have been working pretty hard, and then when I get home I just want to put on the TV and go to bed, even at 5 or 6 PM.  Part of the problem is I will wake up after like 4-6 hours, even if I am still tired, even if it is just midnight.  The even bigger problem is that I have been having all these weird, self-injurious thoughts.  When I have them, I am really horrified and feel a tremendous amount of anxiety about it.  When I am falling asleep, I will *JOLT* awake, and this will happen over and over.  I also have weird thoughts that I might jump out of my window or do something self-injurious while I am asleep, which terrifies me.  I know this is all sort of irrational. Unlike some other people on here who contemplate suicide, I never do that.  It's more like an OCD fear that pops into my head that I might lose control impulsively, or something might happen while I'm asleep.  Sometimes I'm using scissors or a knife and I will have the same weird fear wash over me, and I literally have to put down whatever I am doing and walk away from it.  I don't trust myself.  Is that weird?
Recently, the thoughts are really escalating to a point where I am sometimes really unable to go to sleep for a long time.  Sometimes I will start drinking, just to sedate myself to chill out for bed.  Any idea what may be going on?

"SORRY....BUT IT IS!!!

Obviously, if you are so depressed to the point where you have such a low mood that you don't eat, sleep, shower, socialize etc - and you do this for weeks/months/years - then it stands to reason that this is certainly an abnormal way of thinking and you should seek help.

BUT......nobody ever discusses the opposite - people who are so peppy and happy ALL THE TIME to the point where it's obnoxious. I know (and knew) some of these people and it makes me sick. What make sme even more frustrated is that this isn't acknowledge as a mental issue, but it certainly should be!

When we are first born, we are crying. It is a human instinct to cry or feel fearful when we are endangered, just like it's a natural instinct to smile or laugh when we are pleased. 

But what pisses me off are these people that go around with these big smiles and hearty personalities ALL THE TIME. Nothing seem sto phase them or make them deviate from their ""norm""....death of a loved one, job loss, etc. They always see a silver lining so bright that it probably blocks out every other fucking colour to them. 

And what does the mental health profession have to say about this? Absolutely nothing!!! I'm sorry, but just because you are outwardly happy all the time doesn't make you exempt from having mental illness - in fact, I'd be willing to bet that there's a whole lot of repression going on inside that mind. But that would make this JUST AS BAD a s chronic depression. 

As much as I hate struggling with depression, I hate seeing people who are the exact opposite. Don't make me puke!!!

I may only be 19 but I'd like to share what I wrote with all of you as well. I love you all and I'm always here if you need someone to talk too.

When I graduated this year I tried to make a little speech. I didn't rehearse it, or plan it and was pretty nervous so it wasn't much of anything. I'd like to try and share again what I said. I said how as we move forward a lot of people expect that life will change so much and become so much better just because you are moving to a new location or part of life but I don't think that's true. The only way life is going to change is by the change in your mind. The movement of the clock doesn't produce newness of life, but the movement of your mind. Everyone is going through a change. To a better level of yourself. Don't let your old habits dictate your life. It is cliche but new year, new you. I'm tired of doing what I used to do, if I always do what I've always done ill always be where I've always been. The real battleground is in your mind, you lie down with it, you wake up with it, go to work with it, you smile in front of others when no one knows whats going on inside. You will never be defeated by what others say about you, but what you say about you. New life comes from a new mind and a new way of looking at your life. For those that are close know I suffered from a lot of depression, and eventually suicidal thoughts this year. I owe so much to my friends and family who supported me. Let this be the year we change our minds. I cannot step into the future and still think in my past, I cannot let the rumors and the stain of what they said about me destroy my opportunity. I cannot drag that same old mess into another year. If you do what is easy, and do what I did and become sad and depressed and let life knock you around life will be hard. But if you do whats hard, and continue to work on yourself and grow life will be easy. Excuses sound best to the people who make them up. God made you and said I want you. You have to be willing to take everything life has to throw at you, but never forget you deserve greatness, no matter where you are now, keep that dream alive. You have to have faith, whatever your dream is you deserve it and it is worth whatever it takes. It was kind of rambled but heres to another year.

"I'm taking the scientific side of the story here. Life has evolved over millions of years to adapt to anything that mother nature threw at us, and here we are, humans, in all our glory and achievements, still scaling new heights.

What do we live for? Different individuals will give you different answers, but the top dogs in history came into power for reasons that boils down to one thing, immortality. And no, not literal immortality, rather, to immortalize their name in the books after they've passed on. We all fear death, but what we fear more is to be completely forgotten.

If that is the case, then our rat race, arms race and hardwork all comes to naught in the face of entropy. It's far from now, astronomically far, but know that the universe will tear itself apart one day, not even subatomic particles will be there. This, this is a fate worse than death. All life, heck, even inorganic matter will be pulled apart. So why are we trying so hard to leave a mark in history if nothing matters in the end?

Love, life, hope, dreams... It all doesn't matter. No wonder people want to believe in religion, to escape thos nihilistic despair.

But hey, this is just science, and science is as good as human ingenuity and observation. I'm sure there are things beyond our comprehension, perhaps there really is an afterlife where it's paradise?

But now I'm back in education, I socialise a lot, having people over, going to parties, going to the gym keeping my fitness up and working out, as well as trying to script or at least write down for all the ideas I have for film college, but none of it matters because I'm not happy, there isn't an hour that goes by that I don't think about suicide.

I dropped out of high school in grade 10, I couldn't do it anymore every day the pressures of school and a teacher who graded me differently than everyone else caused me to be physically ill. Every single day I'd use a friends phone and call my mom  sobbing to come pick me up. I was out of school more than I was at school at the point juggling my mental illness and fighting extreme stomach issues that ended up being gastroparesis. Dropping out feels like the worst decision of my life. My family treats me like I'm faking all my issues in order to get out of my responsibilities. When in reality I've been fighting as hard as I can. Juggling financing myself through my art, being homeless, and the crushing weight of my illnesses.

Everyone seems mad at me. My psych office has me on probation for missing too many appointments. If I keep missing them I'll be kicked out and left without my medication. I've been clean from self harm for probably 8 months but lately when I look at my scars all I can think about is doing it again. I don't have time to go inpatient and the suicidal thoughts keep getting worse.

I have people who love and support me but I still feel like I'm letting them all down. I don't know if my family will accept me because of my transition. I haven't told anyone but a few but I'm positive my older brother outed me to everyone and I'm too afraid to face them now. Im not ashamed of being trans but I am afraid of losing the last of my family.

I can't hold a job because of my PTSD. I can't keep friends because I don't think I'm good enough for them and my BPD just makes it harder to connect to people. I'm avoidant as fuck and all I want to do is shed all my mental illnesses and not have to feel this way anymore.

I've failed trying to kill myself. I've failed academically. I've failed friends. I've failed my therapist. I've failed myself.

What's left when nothing you do is good enough?",5,"complete and utter disappointment,couldnt take pressure, dropped out, evI'm faking to get out of responsibilities eryone seems mad, psych office has me on probation, family treats me like"
"Ok, been thinking about posting here for a while, so here goes. Sorry in advance if I end up typing a wall of text. 

I feel like a failure in multiple aspects of my life, and I'm beginning to wonder more and more why I'm forcing myself into this mediocre, oftentimes miserable existence when i dont see anything to look forward to.

Lets start with my love life - there is none. Im a 26 year old guy and haven't even so much as kissed a girl - pathetic.  I cringe at myself even typing that, but there goes. And anytime some situation occurs where I can ""make a move"", I basically freeze up and back myself out of the situation somehow.  At one point I could say it was because I was afraid of doing something awkward/embarassing, but now I don't even know anymore - somethings wrong with me. 

My work life isn't much better either. I can't say they're terrible jobs (i currently work 2), and I'm fortunate that I get along with all my bosses and coworkers, but they're dead-end jobs, only one of which is related to my degree in graphic design.  Speaking of, i realize I don't want to be doing design either. Others I know in the industry are passionate about what they do,  sketching daily and designing in their free time. Not me - it all seems kind of like a drag at this point, and I usually end up feeling shitty about what I make anyways.  I do stencils and screenprinting stuff on the side,  which I enjoy somewhat more, but with two jobs the time and energy to do these things is lacking.

I only have two jobs to deal with extra expenses stemming from another failure of mine - I got a DUI in 2014, and while I paid back the court and am out of the legal system, i still have high car insurance and owe my parents money. Not to mention the regret of having ever been so stupid to drive in the first place. Its still there. 

I honestly want to do voice acting, like cartoons, games and (if i was fortunate enough)  movies. Its something I feel more passionate, and even more confident about in my ability.  But a large chunk of my mind tells me im going to fail,  that i just think im talented (like one of those american idol contestants who think they can sing), but I'm just a hack. And again, I'm almost 30. I feel like it's too late to get into that kind of industry and expect to be even somewhat successful. So i dont even know where to start. 

Im so afraid of taking any risks in my life,  that I cant really live life at all.  So what's the point in continuing on like this? Drifting from day to same fucking  day? 

I don't think I could commit suicide because it's been something that has effected my family (friends of ours that had done so), and I dont think I could do that to my family.  Even then,  Id probably be too much of a pussy to go through with it anyways.  But Ive been thinking about it more often lately

I just hate who I am, but I'm too scared I'll fuck up again to take the risks and try for the life I want, or that I still don't even know what i want in life anymore. I don't know how to fix it, so why bother sticking around anymore? I'll probably still be just as alone and miserable 20 years from now. 

Thanks for reading my griping if you got this far.",5,"feel like failure in multiple aspects, no love life, no work life, trying hard, hate who Iam"

Yesterday my neighbors threw a party and I live on a military base so the walls are thin. They were being so loud and I like to think I'm a nice person. I usually take people's shit because I feel like I deserve everything bad that happens in my life. But last night I took a stand. I asked them if they could quiet down. They didn't quiet down so I got mad and frustrated. I usually do nothing and asking them to quiet down took a lot of energy from me so I called military police after that everyone left and I felt good. I felt like I actually stood up for my self for once. Next day I wake up and I tell my husband that I called the police on them. And he mad me feel like I shouldn't have done that. Am I wrong for calling the police on them? They do this every week. I've been in alaska for 6 months now and this is the first time I have every done somthing like this because I put up with people's shit. I just feel worse now because I thought I did the right thing but according to my husband I'm such a heartless person. Now I just feel awful agian. I think about just killing my self for the most littlest things. Like somthing like this. But then I think of my 4 year old son and what life he will have if I'm not there. And how selfish of me I would be to end my life. At the same time I think he would be better off. I just don't know how to cope with feeling like this everyday. Being an army wife and a mom to a 4 year old is just too much. What makes matters worse is I have no friends to vent about this. And I never ever post stuff on reddit. I'm just tired. So tired. ,5,"called military police on neighbours for loud music, felt good,  stood up for self for the first time, husband got mad, only living for son"
"I've never opened up to anyone, in person or anyone I know in person. I've only ever been honest when talking anonymously with strangers on the internet.

Basically this lame nearly-20 year old has wanted to die for five years and I'm now at the point where it's get help or just do it already. so I changed doctors, the switch finally went through today, but I can't bring myself to schedule an appointment. I've lied to my family, friends (the one I still have lmao), and doctors for years. How can I be honest now? 

does anyone else struggle with this? being unable to open up? I've emotionally isolated myself due to fear of vulnerability and self hatred and I don't know if I could ever open up during therapy, let alone at a doctors appointment about requesting therapy. I get shakey and anxious and want to puke just thinking about it.

It's so bad that I won't even come out as a lesbian, even though my family is very liberal and have told me multiple times if I was it'd be fine. but being honest/emotional/myself just feels terrifying. Obviously - I've never been in a relationship either because of it.

How do I get over this (at least a little bit) so I can get help and medication?? I can't do 6 years. I barely made 5. ",5,"never opened upto to anyone,changed doctors, struggling, emotionally isolated due to fear of vulnearblity, came out as lesbian, never been in a relationship ever"
"I have a problem. I feel like I have that urge to be talking to someone 24/7, and whenever I talk to someone, I don't feel comfortable with them. 
I just want someone to want to talk to me out of sheer interest, not because they may feel obligated to or anything. I want a friend who always wants to talk to me and know about me or my day or whatever.

"Shorter but less detailed version at the bottom...

Useless backstory info: I'm a 17 yro closeted bisexual (mostly on the gay side) teen in the homophobic south. That's not completely my problem. Recently I've been feeling so numb to life and it's to the point where I don't see the point in living anymore. Thing is I'm afraid of dying. For a long time now I've been feeling alone and like I have no one in this life. People are the only thing that make life worth living. I'm not a shy or awkward guy but at this point I don't have many friends in my life. Awhile ago due to uncanny luck I started working at the same job as a guy that I've liked since nineth grade. We also take classes together this year. I don't know what I did but we somehow clicked and became close friends (not THE closest but close). He's a feminine guy so there was a time when I thought he felt the same way but do to his homophobic remarks about other gay people and him showing me a lot of the messages from girls he's been with (the normal guy thing I assume) I made an executive decision to back off of him in that way. However at this point in my life he is one of the only friends that I got and also (again despite us not being that close) the best friend I've got so I really don't wanna lose him. It feels like lately we've been drifting apart despite my absolute best effort to be more talkative, be funnier, and at some times pulling away do to me feeling that I've been coming on too strong. Losing him is my worst fear in the world. Not only is he the best friend I have rn but he's also a guy that I've liked for a long time now. It's like because of my apathy towards life, my loneliness, and my lust for him combined he's subliminally become my reason for living. I've been depressed for a while now and it's a sad thing when you at an age as young as 13 are trying to decide what song you're gonna kill yourself to. The only reason I'm still here today is because I promised myself that I would at least wait until the age of 27 to see if the shit about life getting better is true or not and I chose 27 because of Kurt Cobain. If I'm gonna die why not die with an artistic aesthetic in mind. However everyday I feel worse and worse and I thank my mom for being a responsible one and hiding her gun because idk if I'd be here today. With all that being said my question is this: Should I ask my mom to see a therapist/ psychologist or whatever? The reason I have to ask is because I fear my mom asking me and forcing me to tell her what I'm so upset about and I also fear not knowing what to tell the therapist and just wasting time and money or speaking too much and ending up in some kinda mental hospital. The worst part about all of this is feeling like I don't even have anyone (irl) to express my feelings of sadness to. I just feel like a dog in a cage and all I ever do is go to school, work, the come home and go to bed and I don't know what to do anymore. Am I just gonna be another gay statistic.

Short Version (less details): 
I'm a southern bisexual but mostly gay kid who's felt extremely lonely to the point of suicide for a long time now. I randomly by some stroke of luck became friends with a feminine guy who I've been enthralled with feeling for since 9th grade but found out he was straight. We're slowly losing our bond and I don't know what I'll do without him considering he is my only good friend at all rn. I'm feeling lonely, depressed and suicidal rn so should I ask my mom to see a therapist?

"So I guess I could start by saying I know people out there have it worse than me, and maybe constant suffering is really worse, but I can't stand going back and forth. Good days, awesome days, absolute shit days, mediocre days, ad nauseum. I'll even go from a decent day like today to shit. Really the back and forth has made me realize how shitty the shit really is. It gives me perspective. You could say that is true of the opposite, but all I can think is that the good is amazing, but temporary, always temporary. 

Seeing that distinction is driving me mad, and I don't believe I have anyone to go to about this. I've tried with several people, and I don't get anything. Always sinking back into that realization that the few people in my life have shown themselves to not give a shit is so, so depressing. My happy days are the days I live for myself and forget about my relationships with other people, but that's an impossible life to live permanently because we all have relationships whether we want them or not. 

If I were to contact all the people in my life and tell them I'm going to kill myself, they would be concerned, take the necessary steps to stop me from killing myself, then go back to their lives. This is sort of a tangent, but I'm starting to simply feel like a pawn in other people's lives. Now that I am a part of some people's emotional landscape that they want to keep intact, I can't go. Fuck that.

"Im trying to resist the urge to delete all my social media and disappear. After trying to reach out and reconnect with old friends over the course of the year, it just feels so stiff and like... what the fuck does my input matter when they have a solid group of friends...? I'm an outsider. Usually it's fine. I've accepted it for the most part, but some nights like tonight it's just so crushing to realize that I've slowly melted out of touch with people I used to be so close with. Now they've grown out of me like an old sweater. They have a group of friends and stuff. Which is completely great and fine... I'm just so fucking lonely. I wish I had friends who also considered me a friend...",5,"trying to reach out and reconnect with old friends, feel so stiff, everyone has solid frinds, I'm an outsider"
"I am not much of a people person, more often than not I am forgotten.  People don't gravitate towards me, rather, they tend to stay away.  I try to be sociable, and pleasant, and kind, but it doesn't seem to matter.  People have already made up their minds about me, which is sad, but true.  Some people are just born with it, I guess.  No one wants me in his/her life, there are far better people out there.  People who can sustain a conversation, and be confident and lively.  I am not that person, I used to be, but not anymore.  That part of me is gone, and I don't see it coming back.  I fill my time now with other pursuits, mainly writing and creating videos, neither of which are good.  My writing is terrible and my videos make no sense.  Hell, I tried to make a serious video today, but had to play it off like a comedy because it was downright awful.  I can't even vocalize my feelings properly, nor have anyone truly listen to what I have to say.  There is no point in trying anymore, I feel like giving up.  There is a strange sense of calm to that realization, and it feels more comforting than it should.  I wish it could be different, but sadly, there is no other way.  I suck at everything, except being sad, which ironically enough is what I am trying to rid.  Strange, I know, but right now, it's all I've got.",5,"not much of a people's person, people dont graviate towards me, made up their mind, alone, suck at everything, except being sad"
