"Can't stop the negative thinking about how everything in my life is fucked up beyond repair. Through poor decisions and also situations and circumstances out of my control, I have zero future and no way of changing anything. 

I've become trapped in a cycle of chronic pain and depression/anxiety. It's hard to tell the difference anymore between whether one causes the other or vice versa. 

I can't work because of pain and crippling depression, but I've also been denied Social Security because I've been told that I'm not disabled enough or depressed enough to where I couldn't just shove pills in my mouth and do something--not that I want to be eternally damned to living on a fixed income. 

Things were supposed to be so different. I was on my way to a rewarding career and making damn good money, then everything crumbled, and I literally lost everything. All of my intelligence and good looks didn't do anything for my life against physically disabling conditions and chemical imbalances. 

Now I can't stop the carousel of shitty thoughts that just plays over and over in my head every day. 

I have zero friends anymore, I don't talk to my family, I don't work; honestly, I barely even leave my house. My shitty ex wife has done everything in her power to punish me and alienate me from my children after I could no longer care for them half time anymore after my injuries and spiral downward. 

Now my life is so small. I'm going insane from boredom and isolation and I get full blown panic attacks trying not to think about how everything is so fucked up and how I really can't fix it. 

I have bipolar II, PTSD, OCD, ADHD, and GAD.

My life is a shit show. I just want to run away and never come back but I can't actually run anymore. Lol. And I have no money. And I love my children too much to abandon them. My children keep me alive but also are part of the reason why I am so depressed and anxious about my life. Kind of fucked up in that way. 

I honestly don't know how to handle myself anymore. It's gotten to the point that I will literally just stare at my phone and lay in bed the entire day. I struggle to even put food in my mouth and when I do it's usually only so I can get drunk and not be as hungover.

I am so fucking depressed itâs like everybody around me gets their shit together everybody eventually seems to get what they want except from me I seem to lose everything that makes me happy I am 22 never had a girlfriend all I ever had gotten from a girl was a kiss and then she dumped me! I hate my life and I canât find a job either to have my own apartment I live with my aunt and uncle and hate every second of it I wanna get out and I canât afford it I donât know what to do I donât believe in miracles anymore!,2,"canât find a job, she dumped me, everybody eventually seems to get what they want, seem to lose everything,"
"I just need to vent and I'm all alone. 

2017 started off as a great year. I had a good job, had a great girlfriend, no debt, bought a new car, had a nice apartment. You name it and I had it. Then it all fell apart. 

I feel so alone, I went from everything one day to absolutely nothing the next. I asked my girlfriend of two years to talk because she has struggled with depression and I felt that she was slipping into a spell so I was trying to help her. Turns out she was miserable and decided that day that we were going to break up and that she was moving out of our apartment that week. She left and I haven't seen or heard from her since.

Then I started drinking and realized how alone I really am. I don't have family, I don't have friends. The one friend I did have I screwed up because of my drinking. I just feel alone.

I got demoted at work. Had to start paying for an apartment meant for two by myself. I just had no one to talk to and I still don't. 

I've tried traveling and that doesn't make me any happier. I've tried going out by myself but I just can't talk to people or make friends. I feel damaged as a person. I feel like I've lost everything that makes me a real person. I can't even meet people. I talk to strangers or people who seem interested in talking to me and we get along well, but as soon as the conversation stops that's it. I've gotten numbers from girls to go out and never hear back from them. I've got numbers from guys to try and meet and hang out to try and be social and I never hear from them either.

I hate my job, I hate the city I live in, I hate how I look, I hate my inability to talk to people, but mainly I hate myself. I ruin everything I touch, I am never enough for anyone, and I am never wanted by anyone. 

I try to keep a pretty positive attitude but each day it gets harder and harder. I can't stand to look at myself, I don't even know who I am. Each day I feel more and more like I am not worth anything, that my life just isn't worth it. I wish each day to just not wake up. Each hour sitting at home in the darkness pushes me closer and closer to actually killing myself. I try to hold on, I try to push myself to see the bright side but I can't. 

My best friend doesn't talk to me, my other closest friend hates me. Every person I know that was friends with my ex and I constantly bring her up and how shes so much happier now. And to top it all off I just found out that she is now engaged. We dated for a bit over two years and it just ended. Just so abruptly. And now 9 months later shes engaged.

It kills me to think about. It physically hurts. I feel like throwing up, I'm an anxious mess; but I have no one to talk to about this. Now I'm sitting alone at work for the new years. No one is wishing me a happy new year, no one is caring that I make it home tonight, no one would even know If I killed myself.

Just when do things get better? I hate feeling worthless, I hate feeling like a burden to everyone around me, I hate being alone. I hate the feeling of not wanting to live anymore but honestly it's the only comforting thought.",2,"demoted at work, feel so alone, started drinking, don't have friends, hate how I look, worthless, burden ,not wanting to live anymore"
"For the past 5 years my New Year's Eves have been nightmares. Each year I get my hopes up to do something fun and I am disappointed. Last year my boyfriend at the time promised me we would plan an awesome New Years in the city. I almost cried I was so happy and excited because I loved him so much, I would get to be that person that got to dress up and have fun and be happy. Wrong. 
He broke up with me Christmas night. Then the next day my grandfather died. Then the whole year sucked after that. Then one of my favorite cats in the world passed away. That hit me hard. Don't judge. 

Now here I am, alone in bed, crying, watching everyone else have fun. I wasn't invited to a single thing by a single person. 

My ex that I'm still in love with has had a new girlfriend for months, that he dotes on and praises and is so happy with. I know they'll post pictures together tomorrow of their New Years together - something I so desperately wanted and never got. He hasn't spoken to me since he met her. Proving I was just worthless shit and she is a complete upgrade that he is happy with.  He doesn't care what happened to me. He got what he wanted - her - he's happy, he's forgotten me. 
And I don't want to hear any tired cliches of ""he's a douche, you have value"",  blah blah. He was only a douche to me because I wasn't what he wanted. He's a perfect boyfriend to the new girl - who is prettier and more fun and more successful than me. I don't mean shit to him, I wasn't good enough for him to put effort into. But she is. And now she's getting everything I wanted.

My friends have forgotten me.
My family doesn't care.
I'm a loser with a shit retail job, can't get a single job with my degree. 
All I have is my cat. 

Taking a handful of sedatives so I can be unconscious as long as possible. I'm not trying to overdose but if it kills me then fine. 

I fucking hate New Years. ",2,"loser with a shit retail job, can't get a single job with my degree, He broke up with me, next day my grandfather died, my favorite cats in the world passed away"
"I've had about three interviews and a couple phone interviews and nothing yet. I know it's the holidays and no one is hiring en masse yet. But, God,  sitting around the house sucks.

"Iâm just done at this point. I have to work New Years at my busy ass restaurant and half my staff call out, very thing that can go wrong at work is, my family and friends are all celebrating and enjoying themselves, and I know I might lose my manager position because I canât get other my anxiety and stress. And the one person, my best friend, who i can turn to and try to feel assurance that my fucked up life isnât a waste, is on lockdown with her parents. No phone, no internet, no contact with the outside world. I was supposed to spend I.t with her at work at least but now Iâm outside, crying my eyes out and wondering if I should just slit my wrist after work.... 2017 was the worst year for me and I donât want to see 2018.... fuck idk why Iâm posting this but Iâm feel so tired and worn and broken.

"hi. 

i had another account somewhere but i forgot the login to it, haha. but that's okay. i just wanted to check in, as a sort of outlet for myself since i don't really get the chance ever to just put my thoughts out there. 

it's the new year. happy 2018, by the way. i hope you all achieve what you wish. i spent the eve alone - by choice. i'm 18 years old, and i'm home on winter break currently from my first semester of college. i haven't really spent time with anybody since being back, though. i have my parents and two older brothers. my parents - we don't necessarily have the best relationship but it's not a bad one either. it's kind of just a mutual understanding of boundaries. i give them what they want and they don't intrude on my personal life kind of deal - you know? and my brothers, they're 11+ years older than i am. and it's not like they don't like spending time with me, it's just...they never really make themselves available for me to reach out.

my oldest brother called me minutes after the clock struck 12 to wish me a happy new year and he asked me what i was doing. and i said nothing, of course and he just told me that i could've called them. which was a nice sentiment in theory but i don't know how to reach out to someone that's never really been reachable. 

i guess right now i'm just feeling lonely. and i've realized that i've been feeling this way for a while now. i don't have anyone to talk to. and the people that i thought i did, my friends, are becoming less my friends and more so people who need/want me by convenience. i don't have anyone. but i guess that's nothing new, i just thought things had changed. and that i was living a better life in college.

speaking of, tuition sucks. when i was still in high school, everyone was just like ""nooo you'll get money to pay for school, don't worry! they practically just give money out for students to go."" or ""apply to scholarships! apply, apply, apply!"" like two opposite ends of the spectrum. but no one really walks you through any sorts of processes that you need to go through in order to pay for college. they kinda just throw it at you. i mean, thankfully i managed to get it sorted out. but too bad i had to figure it out on my own. and eventually, i'll have to pay out all these loans on my own too haha. 

i love going to college, it's fun and i feel like i can be a different person there. a more confident, self-assured one. but if i don't figure out all this money, i won't be able to go. my parents haven't really paid a single lick towards my schooling, but they want me to go to school. my mom even took $500 out of my account to use for something else. i mean, she asked to take it out but who am i to say no to my own mother? 

i'm considering just calling it quits after this next semester and maybe just go to community college for a bit then transfer? work a job at the same time too to save up. but then to me, it'll just be like i put in all that work to get myself into a nice school only to drop out. all my effort. gone. i don't know. it just always seems like there's a wall in my way whenever i just want something for myself. 

i have a lot to do. a lot of decisions to make. a lot of people to please. but a lot of people who will never be satisfied. because what i do is never good enough as i always fall short, even though i put all i have and more for those who need me. 

it would just be nice to know i had someone like that for me, too. ",2,"tuition sucks ,apply to scholarships, to pay out all these loans, feeling lonely,  alone"
"The company i work for is in a moving process so many departements are left vacant or just stuff that isnt picked up yet to the new location. Wich typically means fridges with plenty of old food in it and beer, and i had to work christmas and i allready went through a difficult time and i am still doing it. I just got some bright idea that all the beer around the building werent going to be missed so i took some of it (4 cans all in different departments...) thinking that it wouldnt be missed since they have allready left... And i felt somekind of Â«fuck you mentalityÂ» too them since they were the ones that put me on this shift and never give anything in return... i drank the beers when i got home and dissolved further into my missery till my mom had to throw me into the ER a few days later. Now on sick leave and just got home, i have felt a big regret for stealing the beer... Fuck... I cannot grasp why i even had the thought of doing this and i dont know what to do if they find out!!!  Its just some cheap beer i could easily buy for 10 bucks and now my job can be on the line because of this... idk what to do!!! I feel so ashamed!!! It`s not the first time doing something really stupid while depressed but this is just a small inane stupid thing i did wich can have big consequences for my stupid shitty life.. i cant bear it and its making it all worse!!!

"I am currently in my friend's restroom breaking down for the last ~30 minutes. Aplogies for the wall of text.

In the eyes of many, I am sure my life is fine. I am moderately attractive with a relatively outgoing personality and decent intelligence. I get lucky with some thing and have the best friend group someone could ask for. Yet despite all this, I still am overwhelemed with depression. To preface, my depression is sometimes caused by outlying causes, but mostly seems to manifest randomly whenever it wants to.

I graduated in 2010 with high expectations from my folks. Nothing too crazy, but significantly better than I performed. With depression and anxiety, I have skipped on many of the opportunities in life (fun, women, careers, etc) and can't seem to truly overcome it entirely. I trick myself into believing it is gone for periods of time, but it inevitably comes back harder than the times previous. I now am sitting in 2018 having accomplished little outside of making a good friend group, and while having gone into business with a close friend, feel like I am the weak partner.

Ultimately my whole life feels like I squandered it and wasted myself when others could've capitalized and lived a happy, fruitful life while my depression and anxiety rules who I am to this day. Frankly, I don't feel deserving of the opportunities I have recieved, regardless of any good I have done. I know it's stupid for someone in my situation to feel this way with so much good in life compared to most others in this subreddit and elsewhere, so i'm sorry.

Hope you all have a good year.",2,"graduated, high expectations, squandered, wasted myself"
"Happy New Year everybody. I've been on Reddit for a while but didn't know this place existed. I've had depression for a few years, but in my case, my depression comes and goes. So I can feel horrible for a whole month but after feel like I'm on top of the world for a bit. One of the sad realizations of 2017 for me is realizing that there are a lot more people who suffer from depression than I thought. I'm starting to build a good support group of friends and family when things get tough, but I haven't felt there are too many groups (to my knowledge) to talk about depression, except here. Are there any sort of discord groups or anything like that that focus on depression? Maybe even YouTubers that talk about their problems with depression. Sometimes depression hits me at the worst times, so there are times where I can't really talk to people for a bit because everyone could be at work or asleep. I think it would be cool to have a place to go to to talk with like minded people that is maybe a little faster than making a reddit post. I hope I can become active in this community as well. Anyway, Happy New Year, everybody.",2,work or asleep
"Thereâs something thatâs been on my chest lately, well, itâs been there for a long time, I just didnât know. 

Iâve been depressed. Iâm not diagnosed, Iâm too scared the doctors will tell me what I already know. Im scared that Iâll have to explain to my parents that their happy, always goes-with-the-flow son is depressed. Iâm scared that my dad, whoâs born in raised in the back woods of Texas, will say itâs not a real condition. Iâm scared that my mother will blame herself for not spending more time with me, or that she could have raised me better. Iâm scared that my siblings wonât be comfortable with the fact that their brother is ill. Iâm scared that my friends will abandon me when they realize Iâm not the stable person I pretend to be. Iâm scared that others would find out and wouldnât want to talk to the depressed kid. Iâm scared that my thoughts will get the better of me one of these days. Iâm scared that it wonât get better. 

Iâve just finished my first semester of college. My lack of will and drive has caused my GPA to straddle the line of academic probation which would lead to me eventually getting kicked out of my dream school. Iâve come to realize just how bad my mental state has been for years now. I was able to move away from home and allowed to really look back on my life and in doing that, I realized something. I couldnât remember the last time I was happy, or the last time I woke up in the morning and wanted to get up, or the last time killing myself wasnât on my mind. I never had many friends so Iâve withheld telling them these things when we talk. In fact, no one know about how I really am inside. Sure Iâll sit there, around other people cracking jokes smiling and laughing, but deep down Iâm not the one really there. Thatâs just one of my many mask I use to hide behind. The real me shakes uncontrollably while interacting with other people. I want to scream and run away if Iâm ever around people for too long. I tell my roommates to go out without me because I canât afford it, when really itâs so I can let my feelings out and sob without worrying about them being around. I donât even know why I cry. I just kind of do. I can be sitting in the middle of a conversation and suddenly get this feeling like Iâm getting sucked inside a deep void inside of myself and all I want to do is bawl. But I canât. That would raise questions and those questions would lead to the real me under my hollow shell. And that really scares me. I donât even know who âIâ am anymore. My personality changes with every person I know. I try to avoid it. Iâll binge watch a show on Netflix, Iâll get lost in the story of a game, Iâll connect with these wacky personalities in anime. But lately, Iâve lost interest. Those shows and games donât work like they used to. Now I just stare at a paused screen for hours because Iâve just detached myself from reality. 

Itâs New Years. But Iâm the same me. New and exciting treads are sure to come and go but I will remain the same. Itâs unlikely that Iâll see next year, but maybe Iâll drag through these 365 days just to see what happens. Who knows. 

I donât blame you if you donât read this. Thereâs no structure, and itâs more or less just getting all of my thoughts out that Iâve kept in for so painfully long. But if you did read it, thank you? Honestly I just want this to be buried. I just felt I had to say these things before I lost my mind. Being a full time actor is exhausting lol. 

Sorry for the formatting, Iâm on mobile. 



I wish you a Happy New Years. ",2,"lack of will and drive has caused my GPA to straddle, getting kicked out of my dream school, stable person I pretend, getting sucked, inside a deep void"
"It's like this: when I can't leave my bed, when I'm crying all the time, when I'm constantly late to work, when I haven't showered in weeks, I can tell myself: these are very clear, objective signs of depression. No wonder you're struggling with everything. Be kind to yourself.

When I'm able to hold a steady job without screwing up, when I can keep in touch with family pretty consistently, when I can clean my apartment: it makes all the things I still struggle with seem to be due to personal failings rather than disorder. So I hate myself.

I can't focus enough to watch a movie or read a book? Well, you can be on the internet for hours, so you're not trying hard enough to focus.

I've completely ghosted most of my friends? Well, you can still contact your family and two of your friends, so you're not really socially anxious; you're just an asshole.

I'm slow to speak and struggle to find words? Your brain is working better than when you were REALLY depressed, so you're a boring person with nothing interesting to say. By the way, you're a lot dumber now because the real depressive episodes ruined a bunch of brain matter.

I feel ""meh"" and numb all the time? You're not trying hard enough to experience new things. You get up to go to work; you should be able to easily get up and take a walk when you have the day off.

I don't know where I'm going with this.",2,"constantly late to work, can't leave my bed,  crying all the time, haven't showered in weeks"
"I have been struggling with depression for the past 4 years. I am a freshman in college and am currently the happiest I have been in an extremely long time. I have been dating my girlfriend for 2 months now and I have built many strong friendships at school. I felt like I was finally ready to tell my dad about what I'm going through and why high school was so hrs for me and why it has been nearly impossible for me to mend our relationship.

I believe that one of the leading causes of my depression is the family environment that I spent my high school years in. My dad worked two full time jobs because he wanted to leave corporate America so he started a business. Every day he would come home around 10 extremely stressed and irritable. Because him and my mom wanted the best for me they were extremely strict with their expectations grades. Every night would be screaming while I stared at them blankly telling them what they wanted to hear.

When I think back to 8th grade through junior year, it's nearly impossible to remember anything but yelling. I was scared to tell them that I was depressed because my mom is extremely protective and caring and sweet and she would do everything in her power to help me. But I don't want their help. I've stopped cutting and thoughts of suicide are few and far between.

A couple weeks ago I found out that one of my good friends tried to kill themselves. When I was talking to my dad about it he said that he just didn't understand depression and how someone could have depression but nothing to be depressed about. This made me want to share my thoughts and feelings with him even less.

Something my dad shared with me is what completely changed my outlook on everything . He shared with me that his greatest fear in life was losing his connection with me and our relationship completely withering away. I believed that the only way I could get better is if I shared with him what is going on.

After telling him about my depression a few days ago he told me that if my mom found out she definitely would not let me go back to school so she could keep an eye on me. So I'm not sure what to do with this situation. 

I'm sorry if this post doesn't belong here. I just needed to release everything from my mind and write it down somewhere someone could hopefully see it. Other than my girlfriend I have no one to share with. Thank you for reading.",2,"extremely strict with their expectations grades,it's nearly impossible to remember anything but yelling"
"In the ass and out the eye. This has been one of the most painful and stressful years of my life. Everything that could go wrong, went wrong.

I just want about all the mistakes I made this (last?) year.

1) I took a semester off from college because I failed the semester before that. It was a big mistake that I'll now have to make up for. It strained many family relationships.

2) I didn't reach my fitness goal to finally do a pull-up. In fact, I haven't worked out the entire last month since thanksgiving threw me off my schedule.

3) I attempted suicide.

4) I failed at my attempt.

5) I went back to college and still fucked up, albeit much less so.

6) I barely got to know anyone new.

7) Despite the many compliments I receive at work, I feel they are fake and undeserved. I'm the owners son, and I know I'm a great guy, but I will always have the lingering doubt that people are nice because 'they have to be' and I'll never know who's honest.

8) Despite these compliments I'm still a kissless virgin

9) I'm so goddamn lonely.

10) I'm so lonely. I just want someone to be with.

11) I have plenty of good friends and an amazing, extremely supportive family, but for some reason, I'm still so fucking lonely.

12) I just want the lonely to go.

13) I want someone to hug me without me asking for it. I hate how I have to keep looking for attention.

14) I sent out happy new years to my closest friends and they haven't written shit back to me.

15) I'm really tired.

Alot of good things have happened this year; don't get me wrong. I've come to know a lot people and realized just how supportive my family is. But mentally, I just can't shake off this incredible feeling of worthlessness and loneliness.

"So Iâm pretty much just gliding through the days now. I mean, the entire day just passes by and I have no sense or awareness of the time. It seems like before I know it itâs 5am and time to repeat it over and over again. This has gone on for the past 7 months and has gotten progressively worse over time. 

Iâm not really sure what to do. My financial situation calls for me to stay at home with my two young kids while my fiancÃ© works so most days Iâm just trapped in here staring at the same four walls. My fiancÃ© doesnât understand me when I tell him that everything seems dull and grey. I know I sound like a whiny, sad sack of shit but I feel like Iâm legitimately on the verge of a mental breakdown. 

Is there anyone else in here whoâs gone through this who is also a parent? Or just anyone whoâs gone through this at all? It feels like Iâve lost my identity. I keep trying to remember things that I liked to do before I became a parent but I come up blank. Iâve even lost the ability to have normal social interactions. Like, I used to be very outgoing and pretty talkative but now it seems like when Iâm at a social gathering I canât find anything to talk about for the life of me. Then I end up just coming across really weird and desperate and socially awkward. Iâm tired of everyone telling me âthatâs the mom life and you just have to suck it upâ. It doesnât feel like every other mom or parent is feeling this way. I feel like Iâm drowning.

Tl;dr- Iâm a parent on the verge of a mental breakdown and I donât know how to pull myself out of it

"Hi everyone. Hope you're all hanging in at this difficult time of the year. 

I've had depression since I was about 13, and I'm still struggling to live with it. I had a really shitty year last year. Both my childhood dogs died over the space of 5 months, I only had a few clients as a freelancer and I lost them after falling into depression through it. Since my second dog died, I've lost 14kg (30lbs) - I now weigh just 50kg (110lbs) and I'm really struggling to find the appetite to put some weight back on. I'm 25, single, unemployed, live with my parents (this is at least somewhat normal in my country), and still don't know what I really want to do with my life in terms of a career. This isn't the first time depression has crushed me and set me back with no glimpse of things getting any better. No job prospects, no friends, no money, but I know I'm not alone and there are so many people going through so many similar things right now that are just desperate to get back on track. While every year has slowly gotten worse for me over the last five, I feel like I've earned some perspective from my depression and the mistakes I've made. Depression is a prison. I might be serving a life sentence, but with good behaviour and some rehabilitation, I might be able to leave on parole. I can't think exactly what lead to my acceptance of this sentence but I've never felt this frame of mind before, and now that I do I think I'm ready to start fighting again.

If you've been struggling for years like me, if you want to change, and you know what changes you want to make... I always find myself giving up and looking towards next year as another opportunity to start again, so just do it for yourself because you realise you need to and not because it's a new year and that's what people do. None of them last because they all watch their friends and colleagues fall off the wagon together. It doesn't work. Remember these people don't care about change the way we do. We can't treat this change as callously as they do. Ordinary people want to improve too, sure, but we *need* to improve.

"I am 25 soon and have been depressed since I was 15. I just can't see myself getting out of this mess. I used to think life would just ""work out"" as I got older but the truth is nothing has.

No dreams or goals. No pull in any direction. It's never changed. I hide my real self from everybody because I'd be labeled the sad guy if I did I make it known.

Like, what's the point of this cycle if all I end up feeling like is horrible and tired every day? I don't want this as a life.

My family don't know me, hell I don't even know me. I've got zero personality or character. Just a empty shell that plays a role.

Life is and has never appeared magical to me. I don't care about anything or anyone and I feel detached from society as a result.

I've done it all. Eaten a great diet, exercised daily, I don't drink or smoke or do drugs and yet my body hates me.

Sick of pretending. Money is everything and you are judged solely on your ability to make more of it.

I wouldn't wish this intense feeling of emptiness and loneliness on anybody. I want out.

I really don't know what to do. I've tried. Therapy, meds.

I hope I don't wake up soon. This life might not be for me.

"Wow, now that's Not how to start 2018. I work an office-type of a job, which has a lot of communication to do with tourists. My job is tied with issuing a lot of invoices. But today, I made about $3,000.00 worth of financial damage to the company. What's even more sad is that me and my boss, which is a great guy btw, we don't really get well along, and today he welcomed me being very happy himself! It was a very happy moment. I'm a kind of an awkward guy when it comes to communication with my boss. My awkwardness comes from severe anxiety I've evolved from childhood, because everyone was treating me bad, even strangers. It makes me happy when my boss approaches me being happy. But today, I had a lot of important invoices to issue, and screwed each and every one of them. My boss was furious. He shouted at me a lot. Now I'm at a point where I think it's either better to kill myself, or ask him to fire me. My sole point is to not have him be angry. If he's happy, I'm happy. I know, this is really weird now that I'm thinking about it. It's the same way with family. Now I'm behind my desk, alone and hoping to be alone until the end of the workday to go home, and either beat myself to sleep, or cry the soul out of me.
Anyways, because it's New Year's, he decided to handle the problems and remain happy. I can't apologise, they are mistakes I cannot un-do. However, after the storm ended, I appear to still feel a crippling depression. At one point I was considering suicide as a proper way to deal with this situation. Hear me out, I don't have a lot in my life. Anytime I try to succeed a plan, I always fail. Only thing I have in my life is my family to care about. I'm the only man in the house, and I'm still very young. Nobody, but me, could take care of my family, and this makes it impossible to travel anywhere. I feel as if I'm critically handicapped towards achieving happiness. It kills me from the inside. Everyday I strive to make myself happy from little things.

"Iâve always had depression, and itâs gotten really bad this year. Itâs affecting every aspect of my life, Iâve pushed most of my friends away, barely been talking to my family, my finances are a mess, and worst of all, my performance at work has gotten really bad. My boss is very hands off, so no one knew how behind I had gotten, what a mess Iâd made of my work. Well last week I got a kidney stone and had to be out several days, and when I was gone they discovered how bad I was doing. Ugh.   
   
Now, Tuesday first thing in the morning I have a meeting with my boss and HER boss called âdiscussion about performanceâ and I think itâs extremely likely I get fired.

"Hello all. Iâm a college freshman home for winter break. Iâm feeling really alone. My old friend group from high school kinda grew away from me as I went to a different high school, so Iâve been seeing plenty of snaps and Facebook posts about them hanging out together and being really close but have never been invited or even reached out to. I was really close to church friends through my junior year but I basically vanished my senior year because my dad left my family, I had to work, and I had to get myself a scholarship to college (which I did). Theyâre all like a big family, and while they include me in stuff, I cannot escape the feeling that Iâm just a guest there, not a member of that family. 
I did get a full ride to William and Mary (Iâm from Florida), which meant I go to school out of state, while most of them going to state schools. Most of them still see each other all the time and are super close, while Iâve had to start over. It kinda hurts to see my college friends hanging out with their friends from home and still being super close to them while I donât really have that luxury.
There is one guy who I think Iâll be friends with the rest of my life. He was my best buddy in high school and weâre still really close. And my girlfriend, who goes to school in DC, is home too so I can see her. Iâm grateful for them but wish I had a bigger friend group from home that I was still close to.
Iâve loved college, but havenât really found a new best friend yet. Iâve still kinda struggled with feeling like an outsider and not really fitting in. I have plenty of surface friends, but I want a close, supportive friend group more than anything in the world, and I hope itâs not too late. Is it?
Can anyone relate to this? Is it weird to not be close with people from high school? How can I get rid of these feelings of loneliness and feeling like Iâm a failure? How can I find what Iâm looking for in college?",2,"ad to work, get myself a scholarship to college, m a failure, really alone"
"Like right now, I just got up. I need to feed my pets, clean the litter box, brush my teeth, start some laundry, and eat something. It feels like too much. I'm so anxious right now, and I just want to go back to bed and shut down. I don't care about today. I don't want it. 

But if I get it all done, I'll probably feel okay. That's not the case every day, but today I feel like I could get to a good place if I try. 

But then what? Tomorrow starts the same way. Too much to do. Everything's too hard and I feel sh!tty. Until I get some things done and the weight is lifted. 

Heck, even two hours from now I'll be in the same boat. There's always stuff to do. I need to clean the house, make some phone calls, shovel snow, get dressed, eat again. It never stops. 

And sometimes I can feel good when I've gotten somewhat on top of things, but what's the point? It's like an endless wild goose chase. Shouldn't I be able to just feel good, regardless of the conditions around me or what's on my to-do list? 

Also, this is just basic stuff. I don't have any kids, relationships to manage, projects or hobbies, and only about 20 hours of work a week. I'm just trying to keep myself and my animals from starving or dying from poverty, filth, or negligence. And it's so hard.

"Well let me very quickly introduce you to my pathetic life.

I'm 23, been in school from Fall 2012 - spring 2017. I started to have serious depression and suicidal thoughts in 2013. I have no friends, never been in a relationship. I've never had a job. Live at home etc etc. I'm a failure. 

I took a semester break in Fall 2017 because my GPA fell pretty low (2.1) and I have no motivation to continue school. I hate it so much. I'm wasting my parent's money. I haven't been doing well in school for a while and have taken less and less courses each semester since 2014. I hate myself for doing this.

So anyways in the fall of 2017 all I could've taken at my uni would be electives because I failed a pre-requisite only offered in summer/spring. The next wave of courses were kinda ""locked"" behind this pre-requisite. It felt meaningless to stack up on electives. My parents let me take the semester off to take some online courses not at a ""real"" university, but more of an online training program. It's alot cheaper than my normal university.

It's like a online thing where you get training from industry professionals in the games industry. During my time at uni I discovered modding and game development and found that I got pretty decent at it. I've been taking it really seriously since 2015. It's my dream to do it professionally one day. Yes, I know that is probably already making you cringe. I've been trying to build up a portfolio for a while and I feel like this is the first year where I've made some real progress. The courses I took where way above my skill level so I wasn't able to get the ""certificate"" but I learned way more and felt more excited about my life than I have in a while. I really think I can get atleast a remote job if I work hard enough this year. I know you can learn alot on your own, and I'm all for that usually. It's honestly been really helpful to get direct feedback from the instructors and I've learned workflows and really specific techniques that I don't feel I couldn't learned on my own. It feels like it gave my life a sense of purpose. 

Anyways, I told my parents I would go back to University after this one semester off but I don't think I can. The thought of going back makes me feel suicidal. Like it honestly feels if I go back I will end up hurting myself. I hate saying that but it feels so true.

Instead I want to spend another semester doing some more of these ""other"" courses I talked about to keep building up my portfolio. Is it a terrible idea to keep pursuing this portfolio thing? (instead of going to proper uni). I'd effectively be dropping out of college. I could always go back though, I'm not on academic probation (yet), and I wouldn't have to reapply for re-admission if I went back in the summer. I feel like it's unlikely I'll ever go back though.

I really want to do it but I think my parents would be incredibly against it. I'm going to talk about it tomorrow with them. If I'm going to sign up for classes at my normal uni I have to do so by Jan. 9. Even just opening up the University website made me start shaking and my breathing got really heavy. I really don't think I can go back.

So, am I an idiot for wanting to take more of these game development courses rather than going to proper university? Is this a terrible idea? I don't know what to do really, I feel like I'm just stuck and going nowhere in life.

"I'm 15 and from the UK, in year 11 in secondary school. I'm male and although probably not gay, probably not exactly straight either. And I'm autistic, self-loathing and fucking stupid.

I've got two (relatively) close friends, let's call them John and Steve. I'm starting to develop feelings for John, which doesn't help my situation at all. Occasionally I play PC games with them, but I haven't recently.

I've also got an old 'friendship' group from a few years ago who I am no longer friends with because they're narcissistic dickheads who were closer to bullies than to actual friends. There are two I despise the most - let's call them Mike and James.

So, over the past year or so John's been mostly hanging around with other friends (who I occasionally talk to however would not consider myself to be friends with) and largely been ignoring me in school. I've tried to ask him to talk to me more but he pretty much ignored me. I've not told him that I have a crush on him yet but that'll probably only worsen it.

That said, occasionally for a week or so he'll start trying to talk to me over his other friends. Surprises me massively, and definitely in a positive way, yet sooner or later he just goes back to his other friends and I'm just another passing person, just another one of the 1000+ people in my school, and he's barely even acknowledging our friendship. What annoys me even more is that when I am in a Discord (voice chat app for those who don't know) call with Steve (or someone else from my school), they'll sometimes add one of John's friends to the call randomly. I'm perfectly fine with this until they say that John's calling them and leave. Why would he call them all of the time and not me? It frustrates me so much.

And then there's Steve, who's decided that he's going to go hang around with Mike and James and their friend group. I tried to talk to him a few days ago on their Discord server. Mike and Steve instead left the server to avoid me, and not long after that I was banned from the server for trying to talk to my friend on it.

So, now I've got my best friend (and crush) ignoring me in favour of other friends of his and going out with other friends, my other close friend just kinda... ignoring me and joining a group of assholes instead.

Yes, I am that guy who stands alone during break/lunch (or recess for Americans), hoping that just one 'friend' will bother talking to me.

I'm not sure speaking to my parents will be a good idea here. They're all much more outgoing and social than I am, and had more friends than me in school, and I don't think they will fully understand how I feel.

I guess I could try opening up to John, but I'm scared it'll just break down the friendship we've had for nearly 2 years (which is a long time for me). He probably still won't want to hang out with me anywhere near as frequently as his other friends, either.

I don't think Steve would understand if I did open up to him, and I can't now anyway as he's decided to block me in favour of Mike. Downright fucking brilliant.

My final option would be to try talking to one of my old friends who isn't a complete cunt to me nowadays. There are a few reasons why I haven't tried to restore my friendship with them, mostly the fact that they're always around complete cunts who they're much closer to than they ever were to me.

My school starts again on Thursday, and I know that I'm probably going to be lonely the entire term. I just need to come to terms with it.

Anyway, I doubt anyone's going to read this, and I feel somehow worse after writing all of this down, but I'm going to force myself to submit this post anyway. Sorry for the post being horribly written as well; I don't want to read it again because it just makes me feel even more shitty.

There's at least one large car load worth of things to move and I havent got a car or a license - so cant even rent a car and get it done. First I thought to walk with things (only moved a few blocks), like I have already done two times, but it's notably difficult to do so (and since it's getting late I'm contemplating a taxi. One can use a taxi for this, right?).

I've had months to get this all done but of course here I am having procrastinated like hell and dealt with anxiety by knocking myself out cold to sleep. And since the support system is 99% parents I keep silent about this and dont wanna bother them more than this move already has. So yet again I've put myself in an utterly idiotic position of misery.

Tomorrow comes with work again but I am honestly contemplating calling in sick and dealing with this shit between morning and noon instead of now (been here all day and it is now late evening).

Another sad part is that today has actually been a very productive day compared to what I normally pull off.

Does anyone have any similar experiences? How did you handle it? How would you begin to explain to your boss the toll depression takes on you and your performance. My meeting is at 8am tomorrow morning and Iâm desperate to talk to people with similar experiences. Thank you so much.  
  
**Update:** Thank you everyone for your support, kind words, and sharing your own experiences. I had the meeting today. I have to admit I broke down a bit, had trouble getting sentences out, but I tried my best to explain how depression was affecting me and my job performance. They were very kind and understanding, but still said I need to either resign or they will have to start the termination process.  
  
Long story short: Itâs over, I failed again. ",2,"start the termination process, job performance, be fired,resign,  failed again. "
"I recently changed out of a job I loved because of bad management. Iâve had two new jobs since and I hate them. Iâve now got a house to pay for but I canât not work but the thought of going back makes me sick!

I left the last job over anxiety I canât do it again.

"I think the relationship btw money and ur mental health is just direct! If i have so much money i guess i wouldn't be so damn miserable!

I guess peope are right, if u ain't making money u ain't living!
I am just so jealous of rich people that how much they can do and enjoy their life with.

Let's just all admit that happiness is really purely depend on how much freaking money you have, we need to stop telling people or ourselves that money isn't everything, this kind of denial mentality is so toxic!

The more and sooner we realize it's the fact the sooner we will be able to end our lives. Don't u agree with me?
It will never be better, it's just not! It's been so many years, things won't get better, period! We need to face it! I just don't have the balls to end it right now but it is the only way to get out- DEATH. 

I hope we all eventually have the guts to do it, new year's wish-I just hope I can die this year, let me outttt! I can't stand not one second! I need to die soon! I need to jump to the rail or something!
