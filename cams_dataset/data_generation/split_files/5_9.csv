"Iâm a positive guy, I make people laugh, and I have a supportive household, to anyone even on here that sounds like heaven. But ever since elementary school its been a same circle of talking to people, making them happy, and then them forgetting about me in the long run to the point of were I cant tell you who I can actually view as a friend or not. Same thing with girls that I seem to fall in âloveâ  with too easily, I end up admitting my feeling to them and then I either get a ânoâ or âidkâ, and its gotten to the point to were loving someone doesnât even se m option anymore. Love from family is definitely a positive thing to have, but as humans we can thrive to have some form of compassion from a stranger, and as we continue to thrive it ends up going from a want, to a need, to something weâre just depressed not to have. I guess Iâm looking for some form of an answer or resolution before I end up sinking a lot farther than I want into melancholy.",5,then them forgetting about me in the long run to the point of were I cant tell you who I can actually view as a friend or not

All in all my day to day life has improved greatly but I still find myself hitting spells of complete demotivation.

"My girlfriend of 18 months broke up with me last March, I got over her within a couple depressing months. Then, I had bad acne, so I was put on accutane, and if anyone who sees this has taken it, they know how bad it is to take that shit, they even warn you that it can cause major depression, but I just wanted my acne gone. I was more depressed than ever, I hated my job, I was lonely, and I had nobody to talk to. There were multiple nights where I sat by my desk with my brothers 9mm, crying, wanting so badly to pull the trigger, but I knew it would affect all the lives around me. Somehow I made it through those 5 or so months of pure hell. Now the depression is somewhat gone, but Iâm twice as lonely. I wake up every morning to the dreadful alarm being the only notification on my phone. I work 8 hours, all 8, I think of being home, but when I get home, Iâm just as sad and lonely. It feels like Iâm the only one on this planet and nobody hears me or my voice. I guess all I want is for somebody to appreciate me for who I am but Iâm still looking for that someone.

"Back in August I finally got the help I needed, and was prescribed therapy and medication. I'm overall in a much better place than I was beforehand, but I feel myself slipping back. I have dangerous thoughts, I'm crawling back inside my own head, and I left the apartment only once this entire weekend: to do my laundry so no one will notice anything is amiss tomorrow. 

Since I've been on it, I could count the number of days I've missed taking a pill on one hand. Then, over about the last month and a half, I noticed a decline.

I doubt it's a matter of increasing the dosage of my medication either. I'm on Effexor 300mg, have been for a couple months now. My provider told me that I'm already at the upper limit for medicinal dosage, so it seems that simply going up won't be an option. Which kinda sucks, as I'm not dealing with a whole lot of side effects, except for maybe memory problems, which is probably unrelated as it's historically been terrible anyway.

I think it's just simply a matter of it not working as well anymore. At the peak, I could go hours, sometimes a day or two, without a thought about killing myself. Before, I couldn't go an hour without considering it for at least a couple minutes. Now they're back, along with the feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing.

I don't want to go back to that, I don't want to. I want to get better. I just want to know if it's possible for medication to just... stop working like this. To work one week, and then start dropping down again. It sucks. It really fucking sucks and I just want to stop wanting to jam a fucking knife in my neck. 

So, yeah. Is that possible? For medication you've been on for less than 6 months to just stop?",5,"it's just simply a matter of it not working as well anymore, along with the feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing"
"I thought I was getting over it. But now after eight years my depression has reached a new stage. I've managed to self-medicate with video games and youtube for years, but over the past couple weeks it stopped working. Now nothing is interesting anymore. 

It's driving me absolutely bonkers. I'm so stir crazy. I'm SO BORED. But I don't want to to do anything. Nothing feels worth my time. Everything makes me feel guilty that I'm not doing something else. 

I wish I knew hot how to emphasize how bad this is. I can FEEL it inside me, like a thirst. Like I'm craving some physical thing and if it was in front of me I'd pounce and devour it like a tiger. I've always felt uncomfortable in my skin, now it's like all of me. I need to rip myself apart to tear the corruption out. 

I'm going mad, just mad. Like I desperately need a sedative or something before I spiral out of control. I've never thought more seriously about hospitalizing myself. If I wasn't afraid of the treatment I'd get I'd do it now. Someone please give me some advice.",5,"managed to self-medicate with video games and youtube for years,but over the past couple weeks it stopped working. Now nothing is interesting anymore"

"Was once full of potential, playing collegiate ball, doing well in school, had everything I wanted. But a few concussions and stubbornness to get properly treated have led me to a life of constant debilitating migraines, memory issue, and general physical/mental deterioration(depression,anxiety, etc). I went from being a 220 lbs to 170 lbs because I just stopped having the urge to eat due to the constant pain in my head. Iâve seen more doctors than a person needs in a lifetime trying to solve the issues my brain causes, but Iâve reached the point of no real hope. Iâve been diagnosed with Post-Concussion Syndrome and ever since there has been a disconnect with friends and family, a loss of the person I thought Iâd spend my whole life with, and a crushing defeat in regards to continuing my education. I now spend my days tucked away in my dark room avoiding light, loud noises, and social interaction. Itâs not that I choose to isolate myself, itâs that it literally pains me to do otherwise. Iâve never truly considered self-harm, it would lead to major issues for loved ones I would never want. My friends are already all consistently irritated at how difficult it is to hang out with me, but I donât know how that makes me the bad guy (they act as if I am dodging them out of distaste for them or something). Recently I was supposed to go to a big sporting event with a friend in my friend group, but due to the growing frustrations of the others about me, my friend dropped me in order to settle down any issues. After this I found myself seething with anger, but almost to the extent that it became nothingness if that makes sense. This is mostly just a rant, itâs hard talking to anybody about all of this because no one seems to ever truly understand. Sometimes I have this burning anger in me about the way my life has changed, but lately Iâve had more of a sense of numbness. Just not caring at all about anything. I wish I could just move far away and restart but thatâs not happening, so Iâm left laying in bed in the dark contemplating what could have been had the last few years gone differently.",5,"After this I found myself seething with anger, but almost to the extent that it became nothingness if that makes sense"

"Depression and I are at a constant battle. I was home alone for Christmas Eve and it was driving me insane. I felt like ripping my hair off gahhhhhhhhhhhh! To cope with the depression I urge myself to go out. I got put my pants on and went out. I thought to myself what the fuck can be open at 8:30pm thatâs when I passed by Angel City Brewery. It was fucken open. I went inside, it was almost completely empty. I got me an IPA and started walking around, I ended up going to the balcony they have. I sat down on some of the couches they have. I started browsing Reddit like usual, reading every depression post. I was half way done with my beer when some one speaks to me. âIs some one sitting here?â I asked myself is someone speaking to me!? I looked up and itâs a girl. I remember stuttering âIâm sorry?â She repeats âis someone sitting hereâ I say âoh noâ she asked if she can join me and I say yes. Iâm looking at her while sheâs looking around her surroundings looking totally confused. She looked like a very antisocial person. I asked her if she was okay. She said that sheâs never been here before and asked why it was so empty. I chuckled and said â maybe because itâs Christmas Eve?â We both laugh. Soon and then I started feel a warm sensation in my stomach, I began feeling nervous, my depression felt like it was suffocating. 
She asked me â do they have margaritas here?â I giggled. I said no, itâs a brewery they only have beer. She looked paranoid. I asked if she was okay. She said that she doesnât really go out by herself. Then she asked me if I was waiting on someone. I said no, I usually go out alone. I kept looking at her, I asked her what was her name. She told me Maria, I introduce myself. She asked why was I here by myself. I told her I just needed to get out. 
She told me she wanted a drink and asked me if I can go with her to get her drink. I said of course. I started getting even more nervous, asking myself why is this person talking to me. We got to the bar and she ordered a drink, I ordered one for myself since I had finished mine. She grabs her pure and pull cash out and tells me âIâll payâ I responded âOh no, it on meâ she said thank you. 
She asked if they had any games here, I said of course they have board games. We ended up grabbing Jenga. We went back to the sofa I was sitting at. Iâve never played jenga before so it was my first time. Boy did I fucken suck.  We talked for a while, and told me she moved back to LA from Mexico and to pardon her bad English. I told her what you talking about you speak perfect English. As I got to know her, my depression starting go away, I felt happy, I was smiling. 
It was about to be 10pm when she told me she was feeling tired already since she had a long day. I didnât want here to leave, I was enjoying this so much. I told her that it was fine and that I was thankful for sitting with me. I walked her downstairs and we put the jenga game back. We looked at each other for a second. She asked if I wanted her number, I blanked out for a second. Then she said â you know what let me have yoursâ I gave her my number. She told me it was nice meeting me. And told me I should go home soon because it wouldnât be okay to keep drinking. We shook hands and she started walking away. I just looked at here leave the exit, I felt my depression coming back. I walked to the bathroom looked in the mirror when it hit me. FUCK I FORGOT TO GET HER NUMBER!
I rushed to the exit and to the street, all I see is a white Lexus pulling away. She was gone. 
I been thinking about her constantly, hoping she would text me or call me. I went out New Yearâs Eve alone. I kept thinking about her, how happy she made me feel. My depression was gone for that time I was with her. Yet here I am at the same brewery and the same couch her and I met drinking the same beer buzzed as shit . I just want to thank this brewery Angel City for being open New Yearâs Eve. And specially thank you Maria for coming up to me and giving me the best company I had in a while.

I have been dealing with depression for years now and have been doing everything I can to get better. Recently I have been having suicidal thoughts. And even though I have no intention of following through I feel as though my depression would. Whenever I used to get this way Iâd think of all the things I love in this world and Iâd change my mind pretty quick. But now it seems every time I try to do that those thoughts get choked out by my depression. Every positive thought I have gets drowned out and stomped on by the suicidal thoughts and general self loathing. All motivation is gone for me and this point and I do things simply so I am not a burden to people anymore. Iâm scared that in a slump of sel hatred and meaninglessness Iâll do something stupid..

"When Iâm really struggling internally, I overcompensate externally. Think Ross from Friends when he finds out about Rachel and Joey. That episode struck a chord with me because Iâve lost count of the times when Iâve tried to put on a good show and ended up looking like an absolute idiot. Iâd get all loud and animated; try to be funny; try to convince others and myself that thereâs nothing wrong. They say the unhappiest people are the ones that seem the happiest. For a large chunk of my school days, that was me. My face was laughing and smiling but my eyes werenât. In my adult life, pretending got harder until I just couldnât any more.

Why did I feel like I had to put on that front? Originally it was because I just wasnât even acknowledging to myself that I had a problem. These days itâs more fear of how people would respond if I displayed my true emotions. Some people donât âbelieveâ in depression. I donât know how, because itâs everywhere. The word âdepressedâ is flung around flippantly by people who are just upset about something or having a bad day. Maybe thatâs where the apathy comes from. People who claim to be depressed trivialise the condition for those whose lives are genuinely blighted by it.

There are unwritten rules for answering certain questions. When people ask: âhow are you?â they expect to get the statutory âIâm fine thanks, how are you?â Not: âI feel like Iâm falling apart and I canât cope,â or âI donât know how Iâll get through the day,â or some other variation of the hellish truth. That makes for a rubbish situation where, even when you get texts or actual face-to-face enquiries into your wellbeing, you skirt around it or make something up or dismiss it.

âWhat have they got to be depressed about?â

Iâve dedicated the other half of this post to tackling some of the things Iâve heard people say relating to depression. This one usually rears its head when thereâs a celebrity involved. Take Robin Williams for example. Known for his seemingly happy-go-lucky nature and vivacious sense of humour. Clearly his smile was hiding a world of pain. But heâs rich, heâs famous, heâs successful. Whatâs he got to be depressed about? Weâll never know the answer to that, but we need to stop asking the question. Or rather, we need to stop asking it in such a dismissive way. When the news broke about Aaron Lennon, it was immediately followed by references to his income and status as a Premier League footballer. Yes, there are people who have it worse economically and people who have had horrible, harrowing things happen to them throughout their lives and just âgot on with itâ but why use that as a stick to beat someone who is already at rock bottom? They will be well aware of all that. Everything youâre saying and thinking, they will have said to themselves ten times over. So then thereâs the feeling of guilt thrown into the mix; the sense that they have no right to feel the way they do. That just compounds the issue.

âDonât be so sensitiveâ

Depressionâs not about sensitivity. Some of the strongest, toughest, take-no-prisoners- type of people suffer with depression. I know because I know them. There needs to be more openness and understanding surrounding mental health and well-being. But we donât all need to be holding hands and showering each other with compliments and treading on eggshells, scared to say or do anything that may be misconstrued in some way. Far from it. When someone is in the pits of despair, the best thing you can do is just be there for them. In the most normal way possible. You donât have to do anything spectacular or extraordinary. You donât have to change your behaviour or your personality or the way you interact with them. You havenât got a magic wand. You canât fix their problems. But just being there can make all the difference. Sometimes, when wandering the corridors at work, perpetual cloud hanging ominously overhead, the sight of a friendly face coming towards me was enough to make me a bit better. If honest surveys were taken in the workplace, there would probably be a surprising number of people who are experiencing depression or anxiety, or have experienced it at some point in their lives. Everyoneâs fighting their own battles. It would be so much easier if people could join forces.

âItâs attention seekingâ

This one is dangerous, because if someone at rock bottom hears this about themselves, after theyâve plucked up the courage to disclose what theyâre going through, it can send them spiralling into further isolation and their thought patterns spiralling down life-threatening avenues. When I hear the phrase âattention-seekingâ used in relation to depression, it makes me laugh and makes me angry in equal parts. Do people really think Iâve devised this little world of hell for myself and decided to live in it just for the fun of it? That I choose to be a misery who canât see the point in anything anymore? That I consciously throw away people and things and opportunities that mean a great deal to me because I just love to make life hard for myself? The isolation, the hopelessness, the despair, the panic, the dread, the turmoil, the cacophony of emotions â all of them negative â crushing my spirit day in day out. Love all that, me.

"Hi guys,
Looking for any help I can get!
I've been on Pristiq 100mg for 10 years. (Stupidly got forced into it at 18 when my brain was still maturing). Spent the last two years on 50mg, and the last 6 months cutting it in half, then quarters, then 8ths. (I know you're not meant to cut them, but all docs seemed to have no idea what to do.)

I really haven't felt sad or hopeless since I was about 20ish, so have just been taking them as I could never get help or instructions for tapering off from docs. 

These last 2 weeks, I've stopped taking the 8th of a tablet and oh my God. 
I don't know who I am. The side effects are terrible. I am jumbling my words, mental blanking so hard that some days I can't remember how to get home, or find my car in the car park. Extremely angry and irritable, crying over everything, literally a cute freaking dog on TV. I forget basic words, today I referred to the pantry as the bathroom, just weird shit. My short term memory.. Is non existant. I just had to ask my partner to repeat what I just said to him cause I couldn't remember.  I start making up words and somehow convince myself they're a word!? (Refrigenative???)wtf. Yet I'm a lit nerd. I'm an executive too.. In the advertising industry. Words and well written sentences and quick wit are what my career revolves around. I am fucked. Would love to know if anyone else has been in this situation.. I don't know what to do. :(

"Imagine a wide, empty expanse. There is nothing but the brown crust of the earth and distant mountains, hinting that something lies beyond this place. Alone, you drive across the surface, the realization of how screwed you are slowly rising in the pit of your stomach. 

You're so far from your destination that you're not sure where it is or where you are. And the surface below you is not hard; it looks solid but the weight of the car presses into what is deep mud.  It becomes more difficult to continue forward, so you shift up and press the gas to try to keep moving; if you lose the momentum, you will  get stuck. If you get stuck, you know that this is where you'll die. The car struggles and the wheels begin to spin loose, and you sink further and further into the mud. 

Mired in the bog, climbing out you see there is no freeing the car. The sun above is oppressive and harsh, the day humid and long. Echoes of voices from family or friends ring through the mind as you broil in the heat; what is real, and what is imagined? You doubt yourself and everything in the delirium of heat stroke, but you press forward, maybe out of guilt or instinct or spite. 

But as you chase the sun, it sinks below the horizon. The night is cold, and the frost twists down your spine and into your essence. You have nothing left to propel you forward, and fall, confused in the dark, exhausted beyond despair, dying in a quiet agony, alone. That's when you realize that you can't even cry anymore, as the tears freeze your exhausted eyes closed. 

---

I feel that I've come to the point of there being no win for me anymore. I can envision steps needed to meet smaller goals, but I fail each and every time I try and take these small steps. I can't progress in my career and I can't really even afford to live anymore.   Because of that I can't take care of myself properly and I can't imagine getting out of the bog; I am mired here, with no way out and I'm not even sure which way I would go. But what I know for sure: I hate what I see in the mirror every single time I glance at it. 

I've lost most of the people in my life. At this point I think that what shadow of existence I cling to will be completely alone and absolutely cannot see growing into a normal adult relationship like every other, well adjusted 29 year old. I feel that, even if I were to reach my destination, I will continue to be alone as there is no future or meaning to life for a person like me. 

It is so soul-wrenchingly exhausting to paint on a brace face every day and to try, just to be met with more failure and to have the best possible outcome also be one of failure by any societal measure. I had deluded myself into believing that the losing hand I was dealt wasn't going to be where my story ended. Well, I don't set the rules of the game. 

I want to sleep but I can't; not now. I wish I was never born, but there is part of me that wants to live, if only out of spite at this point. I don't want to be bitter or mean, and the only win that feels possible when you've already lost the game is to try and stop caring about the rules and play on ones own terms. It won't stop me longing for the night,  so the icy hand of death can snuff me out. 

TL; DR: my life circumstances dictate that even success is still a failure. ",5,"I wish I was never born, but there is part of me that wants to ,live, if only out of spite at this point, I don't want to be bitter or mean"

I almost donât wanna say Iâm depressed because I know that clinically I am but over the last couple months the despair I was feeling has kinda subsided a lot but now Iâm falling back into a loneliness. I know thereâs no cause but the surges of emotions Iâm feeling are getting stronger and Itâs getting harder to bear. I just wish I wasnât like this but itâs just the cards I was dealt I guess Iâm ok.,5,"falling back into a loneliness, I know thereâs no cause but the surges of emotions"
"So tired of the real world. What a depressing, soul sucking place we live in. I want a world where i make the right choice more often, where i have the willpower to do things i don't want to do. 

I want the fantastic magic and talking creatures and the amazing plots to involve me. I love to read and watch fantasy, but its more and more painful the more i think about how much i want it, knowing its not going to happen.

I'm tired of always making the wrong choice and never having the willpower to make myself do the things i need to.",5,tired of always making the wrong choice and never having the willpower to make myself do the things i need to

This isn't a suicide thing. My head just hurts. Crying so much I have a headache. My fucking ear won't stop ringing. Great. I have tinnitus at 18 despite having been to 2 concerts in my life.

"I've fucked up a lot. I've ruined every part of my life possible. I've dug this hole, and hit rock bottom, and there is literally no way to fix it. I know people will say it's all fixable, but trust me, it's not. There's too many things wrong. So it's like I -need- to do it because my life will not get better, and even if I want to hang on, there's no point.",5,"I've dug this hole, and hit rock bottom, and there is literally no way to fix it"
"I know the first answer is going to be to ask a professional, but for a couple number of reasons that isnât an option atm and I want to know if someone here can help me understand if I have it or not first. The main thing that convinces me that I donât, is the fact that I havenât attempted suicide in any form yet. Although I think of it extremely often, I am very far from actually trying it. Part of me wonders if I would actually be able to go through with it, or if Iâm just being dramatic subconsciously. Mainly my issue here is that I donât want to come off as dramatic to people or insulting to anyone who actually suffers from it before I even ask anyone if I have it. But I feel miserable and malaise constantly, I can barely remember the last time I felt joy or hope of any kind. Itâs like the emotion of happiness is almost foreign to me, like when I see people who feel this way I just feel isolated because I can rarely ever share in it. My sleeping schedule is a complete mess, and I can go days without eating. I felt Iâve lost all my motivation and this coupled with other factors (some listed here) have caused me to fuck up my life and future severely. Itâs come to the point where my life seems so lost that I almost long for a complete failure so I have a prime opportunity to die. I tell myself that the only reason I havenât offed myself yet is because I fear what pain it will cause my siblings, and the pain of loss is what has made me feel this way (I wouldnât want to put this on them or anyone) although part of me thinks itâs just fear of death or subconscious insincerity of my thoughts. Sorry if this is extremely rambling. I donât want to come off as a cry for attention either, but I just need answers.",5,motivate myself by using it as a prompt to improve social interactions
"I've become so forgetful in the midst of my depression in the past... oh, 2 or 3 years that I genuinely don't have a lot of strong memories from 2017.  Seriously, it's not just a case of me still thinking that it's 2017, it's more of that I almost feel like I... slept through 2017 or something.  I feel the same with the latter half of 2016.  I remember 2017, I suppose, but I don't really feel like I LIVED through 2017.  The entire year feels like a blur, and no other year from my memory feels like that.",5,"entire year feels like a blur, and no other year from my memory feels like that"

"Lately, most often at night, I'll get extremely anxious and begin feeling like I'm not me. Like I was someone else who was placed into this body. I also get the physical feeling that the world stops existing, and that I am isolated to my area. I feel like I'm going insane. This has started recently (last 2-3 months), I'm 17, and have not begun taking, or have stopped taking any medications. Is this an anxiety attack? I'm either numb, or this, and I'm scared this is forever. ",5,"get the physical feeling that the world stops existing, and that I am isolated to my area"
"I feel like all my emotions are fake, and everything I say is a lie because of it.   
I feel like my bad days are just fake and in my mind, and anything I like is garbage that I'm not really interested in, I end up feeling like I don't really love friends and family.   
I just end up hating myself because of these feelings and feeling even more detached from the world.

"I seriously have so much anxiety in me going on that I canât stand it any more, only thing I do is lay in bed and do nothing at all. 
I am diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder and take medicine but it does not help. I had a lot of therapy but nothing helped.
All my thoughts are going round the same topic: what can I do today to help myself? Meditation? Active things? Take a bath? Read a book? What should I do?!?! And this repeats till I go to bed again and my results are that I did nothing. Lol. How can I break this crazy cycle? ",5,How can I break this crazy cycle

"Hi! Was just with my therapist and she suggested that when depression says âisolate yourself from your friends and familyâ, do the exact opposite. Seek them out. When anxiety says âavoid all your problemsâ, face them head on. Depression has a way of convincing you that only the worst things are true. Tell your inner saboteurs to kindly fuck off! You deserve much better.

This is much easier said than done, but if youâre like me and you enjoy being a contrary little bitch, be a contrary little bitch to depression!",5,isolate yourself from your friends and family
"So I took a week off because I couldnt handle work anymore and started to isolate myself again. Today I got called over and got fired for 2 reasons. 1. I dont enjoy work

"I know the feeling of complete and utter despair that many of you face daily. I know that in many ways it is not cope-able. You feel like youâre dying inside or you very much have a desire to not live anymore. I know that pain and how real it is. However, just know that with the right doctor and the right combination of medications, it will subside almost completely. If youâre constantly feeling this pain, then something is clearly wrong with your treatment. Just know that it does get better. It does get easier. Brain chemistry can be a real asshole at times, but it is very treatable and you donât have to live in a constant state of suffering. Hang on to that hope. =)",5,feeling of complete and utter despair
