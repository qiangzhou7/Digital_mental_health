Next to me are my Acetysal tablets that I bought earlier today, two packets. I have no regrets I just know what is the best for me. Some people will criticise me that I'm selfish and don't care about my family. I care about them, BUT I CARE ABOUT MYSELF AS WELL. I live in pain everyday, I don't want this life, I really sound like a teenager, huh? Yeah I am but the reason for my decision is not that ' a girl didn't like' or ' I am not enough ' type of thing. I just hate what am I and that I cannot become what I want. I don't like me. I hate me. I can never achieve what I want if I am me. I don't want me. It's painful, I don't need this.

They have everything to look forward to. Their journeys are just beginning.

They are old and tired dad is 60yo and mom is 58yo and I'm also so tired of everything I never had any true friends, never had girlfriend, finished crappy high school, quit college on third year because of loneliness and depression. Never got any job. I spent last eight years basically 24/7 with either my father or mother. I don't get out without my dad and you know it's enough. He didn't had great life either he worked as police officer he never got any time to relax and rest because he is basically babysitting me ever since he retired.

"I feel like my life is falling apart and has been for awhile. Iâve been feeling numb towards my boyfriend which sucks because heâs trying so hard to help and I just end up hurting him. Iâve been thinking about leaving him because I want him to be happy and I havenât been feeling anything really towards him. He just feels like a best friend to me right now. But we have been together for 7 years. My depression and anxiety was good for awhile, I was on meds but they actually made my down days worse and made me have suicidal thoughts so I stopped taking them but now itâs gotten worse again. I donât want to kill myself but I would like to just disappear. I just want to feel again. I want to feel like myself again. I donât know who I am anymore. 

The worst part of it all is that I do still have some feelings, they just arenât towards who they should be, my BF. And that makes me feel even worse. Iâm tired a lot of the time, I havenât been eating enough and Iâm scared for the future. Iâm scared of change and what Iâm going to ruin next.

I have no real friends, only one that I met on a game 4 years ago. Ever since I was a child everyone told me that I'm so shy, I've been working on this problem and I think I improved. The eye contact is so important. I'm feeling so worthless and I don't know where life will lead me to. I'm also so sad because in 3 hours it's the NYE and everyone is supposed to have a good time partying and I'm staying here feeling insecure and lonely. I have severe acne and never had a girlfriend or even a kiss. When I'm talking to girls that I find attractive I stutter so bad and don't make eye contact but with the rest of people I think I'm improving. Also... serious overthinking.

"I'm a 29 year old man live alone, no friends anymore, no girlfriend just isolated and alone everyday.

"For my entire life, I've been a little off on the inside. I feel like I have felt everything. I had deja vu all the time when I was a bit younger, like I had already seen everything. This grew into anger and hatred for non-original thought. I see it as people thinking that they say original things, but in my mind, it makes me extremely frustrated. 

A little while ago, I started watching anime, primarily moe content. This woke something in me, and it wasn't good. It left me with very high standards and expectations of females, both physically and in terms of personality. Lately I've been seeing all girls around me as unimpressive, and I desire something more.

At this point, I was on the verge of depression. I'm seeing everyone as inferior and not worth spending time with. This is strange for me, because for my whole life I've loved others and felt extreme empathy and compassion for everyone.

So here I am, with high standards, irritable, possibly depressed, lonely, confused and wrathful. Now, another unreasonable standard in finding a female my age (16) approaches. I have developed a desire to be obsessed over. To the point where she'd hurt herself for me. I'd feel immensely sorry afterwards, but I'd still make her do it again. (Sick I know...) I don't know if I want the feeling of being the hero or what, but this has become somewhat of a must for me...

I've read a lot of 'help', nobody feels the way I do. I might consider myself in a somewhat critical state of emotion right now, as I feel too sad to leave the house, or even my room. Please help me...

"Sometimes i get these waves of immense sadness. I remember having them as a kid. It doesn't occur that often now as it did then. I noticed that it happens when i'm dressing up or know i'm going out somewhere. for some reason, that seems to be the trigger most of the time, sometimes it's not. 

When i was a kid, i didn't think of it much. It's like 'this happens and i'm sad for some reason'' and it lasted briefly. 5 min max. I googled these waves and experiences were pretty similiar to mine from what i've read. But people there seemed to be on some medication and i never was.

I was as young as six, when i remembered the feelings of these waves. It felt like pure sadness and dread. It would get me so out of nowhere too. My heart would suddenly feel too heavy and it seemed like it would slide down from all that weight it was suddenly carrying.

I kinda felt like i wasn't in my body either. Nothing too extreme but detached kinda. Like i was talking normally and moving normally too, but it felt like something was doing that for me and i was so small in my body, somewhere in the background, watching.

Spending it alone. I know there are parties around where I would be welcome, but I'm tired. I can't deal with wearing a happy mask today. So much bad stuff has been dropped on me in the past week or two that I just can't.

And here comes the New Year. I know it's just another day. An arbitrary start and stop point. But I still cant help but think about how it's a bad omen and since I'm starting it bad it's just going to be a bad year. Optimists might say ""hey, it can only get better from here.""

"Like I often think that depression isn't a disability and I'm always in amazement when I am actually aloud to take time off of work from it.

I see people with beautiful appearances not looking happier than anyone else.

Don't know if there's a specific section for this but I just need some advice from others who may relate to my thoughts (this is kinda like a penny for your thoughts situation)

I'm done. Tired of feeling paralyzed in my mind. Tried to cry due to the overwhelming feelings of shame, self loathing, anger and pure fucking unexplainable misery but again I'm not even allowed the privilege to alleviate and try to find resolution.

Not even going to try and kill myself as it is fleeting, each a failure and my life being the biggest. Been to all the therapists and doctors who all gave up on me as my mind is broken beyond repair and all I get now is the ""is does get better"" bullshit when it does absolutely nothing for me. I'm just so tired of everything now and im getting frequent waves of pure hatred for people in general which makes me just want to be someplace alone. I hate being around people as they all seem to shit rainbows and unicorns which highlights just how fucking miserable and alien I am. I feel so defeated like why do I have to put every ounce of effort to fake a smile and turn up to obligations such as work as society wants ""happy and self motivated individuals"" which is all a load of shit. I also cant comprehend how and why people are so naturally happy. Like it's almost New Year's Day and I can hear again such loud reminders of how the vast majority of people are normal and happy beyond belief reigning in on the new year when I'm sat alone in my room, had a breakdown wanted to kill myself again with new inventive methods as my previous ones have eluded me like my sanity and contentment towards life.

Again, why can't I just feel basic emotions? Why am I forced as this hollow, pathetic husk of a person and my mind being a shattered vessel lost miles down in a fucking  sea  somewhere when all ""normies"" around me are full of shits and giggles being so blissfully ignorant drinking and getting piss lit. Why can't I smile as I feel positive emotions or laugh at something funny  or even feel scared I could be chased by a crackhead or a clown or something. Nowadays there's nothing. I don't smile. I don't eat or sleep properly. NOTHING is worth doing all hobbies and shit I liked are a chore or a pass time now I'm just counting down the days and even this year has been this shittest and yet I'm still coming into terms how my attempts have left me alive and why I'm continuing. Why bother living if I'm not happy or content and I'm living in auto pilot. I dissassociate my way through life and I'm hitting 20 in 2 months.

I just need something to help at this point. Restarting my 700th therapy session/s on Friday so hopefully she can sprinkle some fairy dust in my water or some shit cus as far as things go I'm losing the slither of faith I have left. 

Thank you for listening. It's 1hr 30mins till New Year's and I hope I fall asleep as I'm not listening to all the fireworks and all this bullshit. Nothing to celebrate for me .
