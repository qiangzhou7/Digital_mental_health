I actually can drive and willing to but, the freaking state jerks me around. Because oh... You went to a mental hospital for two weeks from being suicidal when you were 16! That was almost 4 years ago and, it brings me down. They tell me that I need to be medically evaluated but, I can't get a drive to get medically evaluated when everything is 30-40 miles away.

I'm not going to ram a car into a person when I start driving, chill out. I would call a taxi/uber but, since I am so damn far away from everything that would cost probably around 50-100 dollars per trip. :/",2,can't get a drive to get medically evaluated when everything is 30-40 miles away
"A lot of the trouble I have is I've been down so bad for so long I don't even know what to do with myself and I start ruminating and feeling shitty. I can't keep myself frantically busy all day obviously, but the moment I stop my brain takes off into bad territory and digs up bad stuff.

"I used to have goals. I wanted to be somebody that my parents would be proud of. I used to believe that I was destined for bigger things. Reality hit me. Iâm not special, the world doesnât revolve around me. I exist but my existence is not as meaningful as I thought. I realized so many things about myself this last year. Iâm not as smart as I thought I was. Iâm not important to anybody. I have nothing to offer to the world. Itâs just a hard realization I came to. I was never meant to do anything but work a dead end job living paycheck to paycheck. I set a date for when Iâm going to die. Itâs the only thing I feel like I have control over, but even then I donât know if I can hold on for a few more years. Iâm struggling to find anything that will give me purpose to be here. Iâm alive but every day is the same and all I want is purpose. Just any reason to keep going. The world is beautiful and there are so many reasons to not give up, but I canât find any right now. I wish somebody would notice that Iâm not ok. I donât know what Iâm holding on to right now. ",2,work a dead end job living paycheck to paycheck

"I'm a dude, almost 19 years old, and I live with my parents. I don't work, I've quit college right after joining ( this past fall ) and I very rarely get out of the house. I spend my time playing video games and watching youtube videos. I frequently ask myself what would happen if my parents kicked me out, if I truly was alone and had to fend for myself. Am I just a spoiled lazy kid, or is what I'm claiming real. I DO feel shitty sometimes, but I'm in a sort of hibernation the rest of the time if that makes any sense. I DO remember having real issues with anxiety, finding it incredibly hard to talk to people at times but right now it doesn't really feel like anything. I have a couple of really good friends but I don't really like hanging out with them anymore. I've just sort of accepted where I'm at right now.  I've talked to my friends about depression but even though they could relate and have issues of their own, I feel like they're still going forward with life. I want to know for sure that I'm not just making shit up and what I feel is real but I'm not sleeping 19 hours a day, I'm not a junkie and I haven't attempted suicide. I want to get better and I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now but I'm really afraid that I might just be a prick.

"I often go to bed at 3-4am and wake up at 12-2pm. I know this is terrible, probably unhealthy, and also when I have to wake up early (for appointments and things) itâs the worst. 

And it doesnât help that when I am trying to sleep, itâs hard because Iâm plagued by thoughts about needing a job, not putting enough work into school, what people think of me, thatâs to impossible to be with that girl I like because all I know about her is from twitter, how Iâm a terrible creepy stalker weirdo for crushing on some random person on twitter, you know, the usual stuff.

But when Iâm in bed after 12, and Iâm watching a movie, or playing a game, or whatever, itâs the only time I can REALLY relax. 

Iâm currently a college student, so this schedule works for the most part. There are lectures and things I have to attend, but those are often later in the day so it works out. 

I live with my big family, (Iâm an introvert, as if that wasnât obvious.) and while yes, Iâm able to do things by myself or alone, it still feels... I donât know, not as relaxing? Itâs like Iâm half relaxing, but the other half isnât.

Again my familyâs big, and most of them are loud. Iâm a quiet anti-social shut in, so naturally I spend a lot of time at my desk where my desktop is.... and pretty much everything else. This is setup in the most popular room in the house, so even if Iâm doing something by myself and alone, 95% of the time thereâs *atleast* one other person in the room.

Like I said, they can be loud, playing games, talking to online friends (jealous), and younger kids running around and playing. My two little brothers (both under 11. For reference I am 20) adore me, which is great, I love them too.... but the problem is that means they love to come a visit me, talk to me, play in the same room as me, etc.

It just feels like I never can relax... until everyone else is in bed, and I can do whatever I want and not have to worry about anything. 

**Itâs like living is my job, and when I get into bed is when I finally get off work.**

My therapist is telling me ways that I can get my sleep schedule to be more normal, so that way I can have more time in the day, but I was thinking about it and... why would I want that? I never feel fully comfortable in the day, and late at night is when I can finally just forget about everything. So why would I want to take that away? Iâm mean sure Iâll get a lot more done, but if I have to sacrifice the only time I can fully relax, is it worth it? ",2,"not putting enough work into school, what people think of me"
"I got a text from the girl i like. I'm trying not to cry, because I don't think I'll be seeing her again. I fucked up, and now i can't go back to college, don't have the money or the grades. My heart hurts guys. I'm listening to roaring tides II (it usually cheers me up somehow), but not tonight. I don't want to stop the music. Because without the music, I'm alone. I just have this hole in my heart, and I still have to finish my letter to her. I'm gonna drop it off when i pick up all my things. 
It hurts, guys.

"For the past like two years now Iâve been depressed with on and off suicidal thoughts which sucks ass man, but lately around mid 2017 I started to just become numb and not even care about shit. My grades have t always been great, but itâs freshman year and i already failed first semester of algebra, almost failing like one or two more classes, and have to retake algebra in the summer. I donât know if I can do it man. Everyone says Iâm smart and Iâm not actually depressed and donât have ADD when Iâve talked to them so many times. I do actually have ADD and am pretty damn sure after having heavy depressive symptoms for over two years Iâd start to notice Iâm actually depressed. No one takes a 15 year old kid seriously. Sure, I ride bmx which is like the only thing I live for (and photography), and Iâm a funny guy too. Most people even say Iâm pretty attractive, like a 9/10. Iâve only had one official girlfriend, and two other girls Iâve had a thing with. I do know that multiple girls like me, and one of my female friends even said she liked me before, and still does, so do I, but I think we both agree on just being friends. I honestly donât think it would be the best thing to do to try and become more than friends. Sheâs probably my best friend, and vice versa, and one of the only people I feel comfortable talking to about my shit, along with one other really good female friend. The thing is though, I havenât been able to talk to them since my parents took my phone a couple weeks back before break, and now during break I havenât been able to have it or talk to anyone, or hang out. Iâm not complaining or anything, I think no phone for now is actually good to take it easy on electronics and become more outgoing, trying to become involved in people and nature, or just other things than texting and playing games all day. Although Iâve been filling my time with anime most of the day, and I have wrestling practice almost every day for two hours which keeps me really toned and healthy which is good. Iâm just tired man, I donât even know why I just wish I wasnât existing. Now Iâm just rambling shit. If you actually read this, thanks.",2,"freshman year and i already failed first semester of algebra, almost failing like one or two more classes, "
"Good Evening, everyone. I landed a job interview tomorrow. It's my first job interview since I got fired from my old job and checked into a mental institution/rehab February 2017. I've been clean and sober since the 23rd of February, and got on a mixture of different antidepressants (Lexapro, Mirtazapine, Seroquel). I'm anxious as hell and I feel like I'll fuck this up. I really hope not. The starting pay is a little higher than my old job and I actually get benefits with this new opportunity. Hell, even the work hours are great. I just can't shake the feeling I'll fuck up. I really don't want to fuck it up. I feel like my medication has been helping for the most part, but shit. I still can't get the idea that I'm a fucking hopeless drug addict out of my head. That I don't  fucking deserve a second chance at doing something in my life.

"Iâm not sure Iâm depressed or not but hereâs whatâs Iâve been going through. I sometime feel great and productive in the morning and when Iâm about to leave home, I get this very down feeling forcing me to overthink about my appearance, my life, my education. Or in the other word, I feel good in the morning and feel worse in the afternoon. It happens like only 1 or 2 days a week, sometimes every 2 weeks, or sometimes none in a week. I have googled stuff about depression and bipolar (not sure whatâs the difference) but Iâm not certain what Iâm going through. Iâve been getting told to see a therapist on the internet but I donât feel like spending my money on that especially I have financial issues.

"25,male, no job, no girl, depressed after graduation. I graduated 6 months ago with an accounting degree. I don't have many friends like I did in high school. I want to be more social and make more female friends, but I feel like shit and always staying home is just so depressing. I want to get a job that is enjoyable but I don't know what to do beside accounting and I don't really find accounting that fun or have any passion towards it. I just feel very lost right now because after searching for a job for 2-3 months after I graduated, I kinda gave up because 1 offer I got was like below 30k and internship I went to during school, I was like an errand boy in office and doing filing and trash work. I can't stand that shit everywhere I go. I'm just really lost with my life. Every day is passing and it's 6 month before you know it. Fuck, I am just wasting away. I want to go to social events and all that but I want female friends to go with and I don't know how to go about making friends since I am pretty nervous or introvert around females. Don't have the encourage to engage one. I feel my life is fucked. Is there anyone who just felt like this and have any advice because I'm losing my mind! ",2,don't really find accounting that fun or have any passion towards it
"I'm sure that most people already understand this, but I keep falling back into the same shithole that's depression. The worst part of it is, I still doubt my condition, despite being told several times. Maybe it's because of my extremely young age? Not only that, I still feel I have no right to be depressed. I don't feel obligated to feel sad because I have almost everything good for me. 

I'm a lazy slob with no sense of responsibility or alarm.

At least that's the name I've settled on for now.

Currently, my friends are all sharing remorse over one of their girlfriends getting in trouble for being gay (but that's an entire different story that I won't go into) and I haven't said a thing (we share a group chat online). It's not that I don't care, it's just that I'm scared that my depression will make me sound selfish. I don't want to tell them I'm depressed because it'll likely make me sound selfish. 

Either way, I can't really win right now.

I've been holding back my feeling from them for such a long time (we've all vented to each other except for me as of now) and I don't know how long I can take it.

With that in the way, I've just been left alone, left to be the shut-in I am. 

It's already so difficult to carry a conversation with social anxiety.

I only find comfort online or in virtual/fantasy worlds so all I do is play video games.

I used to be so passionate in drawing because it made me happy, but lately it has been months since my last drawing. 

I'm a disappointment to my parents.

I cost so much money.

I do nothing to benefit anyone.

I feel as if I'm some add-on that you can remove, and everything would still function properly.

This may seem all over the place, but I need to vent once again.

I'm sorry.",2,I'm a lazy slob with no sense of responsibility or alarm
"I'm just lying here wondering what the point is of living. I'm not actively suicidal, but I feel like life isn't worth it *at all.*

A brief run down of my life:

I'm a graduate student. I've sunk 80k into my current career path, for a total of 120k in loans. I have one semester left to complete and I should be looking forward to it but I'm dreading it instead. I've lost my passion for my field and I know I'm drowning in debt. I'll make around 45k a year when I graduate so I'll be in debt until I'm 52. I feel like I have thrown my life away. I worked really, really hard for 8 years in college and it wasn't worth it.

I am 25lbs over weight, the most I've ever weighed in my life. I hate my body and myself for letting my body get this way. 

I have several chronic medical conditions including fibromyalgia. Life is literally pain for me. Physical pain.

Nothing I do makes me feel anything but sadness. I'll be doing my absolute favorite things and be fighting back tears the whole time.

All I can think about it how I'm going to have to struggle the rest of my life and it'll never get better. I won't make enough money to even take vacation or live in a nice place. I'll have to work really hard, more than healthy people, to just keep my job so I can just pay my debts and never have anything nice or any rest. And I'll be in pain the entire time until I can finally just die after a long, disgustingly hard life of struggle. The End.",2,"graduate student.

"Iâm just laying in bed with tears rolling down after waking up from a long nap. My thoughts are scattered so bear with me. I feel pressure in my chest. I have work deadlines and shit I should have done over the holidays. It was an easy work day though since I left early to get a tooth fixed that Iâve neglected for more than a decade. I didnât see the point in getting it fixed though - my dentist made me. Itâs a waste of time and effort on me. I went home after and had a 4 hr nap ... and woke up disoriented in the dark before it hit me that Iâm still alive in this life I hate. I always find myself in this place thinking and fantasizing about the end, no matter how my day went. My day could have been amazing and I still ending up thinking about the best way to die.   
I have help- I have a family, a wonderful psychiatrist, a good job. I had a lot of love to give but in the end I just donât want to live. No matter how much people try to convince me, I just donât think I was made for living. Iâve tried, Iâve really tried. I exercise and run, I socialize, I work, I spend time with my family. But all I want to do is waste away. I wish I could give my body away to someone who would appreciate it more.

Monday through Friday it's Wake up, bathe, dress, eat. Drive an hour in backed up traffic to get to the job responsible for this life sucking routine...Shit, I'm 10 minutes late. Boss is gonna threaten my lively hood for such a simple mistake.    

""Stop crying, at least you get paid. You should be grateful for those hours and all that money you made"".  

Yeah that's what my parents say. I can understand the reason but I just don't see it that way. Dress the part, smile and Kiss ass at a job that you hate in hopes for a promotion, 4 years go by and that door still hasn't opened. I hate it. I'm looking at the clock and its 2:28 AM, I've been up all night drinking and thinking about the day life ends. Hopefully soon.    

I'm only 25 yet It feels like I've reached the end of the line. Life is just a constant struggle of standing in line and trying to survive. No girlfriend, kids, friends, a broken family. It's just me, myself and I and Mrs. Brandy. I've contributed nothing to society and why should I? Society has given me nothing but pain and disdain for everything around me.    

Some stupid motherfucker gets in front of a camera and shows the world how stupid they are for 5 minutes. Now all of a sudden they have millions and have the fucking balls to say that they started a business!? Yeah society loves that shit. Hitting subscribe, follow, retweet, Keep feeding and endorsing it. I went to school, college, got a job and in the end I'm just another nobody with nothing to show for it. That shit gets to me.  

I feel uneasy posting this, not out of fear. I just don't usually share my problems, because hell nobody cares. Don't try and tell me things will get better, I'm past that. I've accepted the fact that most of us are destined to be trapped like rats in a maze for some sort of sick experiment. No matter what route you take there is no exit....except one.

I'm an embarrasment to them, nothing more. I still don't know why my parents wanted kids in the first place.

This world is so fucked up. Society only wants you to live so they can get money out of you. Everyone is selfish and only thinks about themselves. I try to avoid the news, but every time I catch a glimpse of it, I realise that we're fucking up more and more every day. How can you bring children into this world? How can you expect them to be happy?

I want to die. It's all I can think of. This suffering isn't ending, because I am never good enough and I never will be. My parents tell me to just suck it up and fight against it. To stand up for myself for once. To try to change. But I can't. I'm just weak. They're right, I'm never going to accomplish anything in life. I'm never even going to be able to get a job and keep it. I don't know why they're so against me killing myself, if they call me a burden every single day.

But you can bet that as soon as he's not alive anymore, I'll be out. I know it's going to be years and years of suffering ahead of me. I don't know how to push through. But I have to, for him.

"My last job was initially a 12 month contract, that I extended to 16 to cover the department's busiest period. I really liked almost all of my colleagues but hated the work, as well as the studies I had to do alongside (work related qualifications). That, alongside depression that had gone undiagnosed and untreated for, let's say 9 years at the time, led to me letting the contract end and leaving.

My last contracted day was 31 August 2016. I started taking antidepressants in mid December of that year and started online Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in late December just gone (having been on the waiting list since October 17, maybe).

It feels like I've gotten dumber by the day. At my worst I was playing videogames for maybe 16 hours a day, just for the escapism. I listen to a lot of podcasts these days but even then, if the weather is shitty and/or I can't drag myself outside then I'll just throw GTA V on and grind that whilst listening, doing the same boring missions that I stopped enjoying long ago for the in-game money that I don't even need to buy stuff that I don't even want. 

My concentration was always better in work compared to home study, but the brain is a muscle too and I fear I've lost that ability to concentrate in this time out of work. It feels like I've got dumber every single day in the pursuit of that escape. Even when I'm listening to podcasts that are educational, that doesn't matter. It feels like the brain itself has lost its processing power and memory. 

&gt;Edit regarding escapism: I feel the need to distract myself at all times. I've had a rail card application pending for around a week now, I just remembered after posting - sorting it now. How am I supposed to be relied upon to do the simplest of tasks? 

I have stopped socialising, having seen one friend once in I don't know how many months, I even stopped chatting online, having muted the group chat. I just seem to have no interest in what they're talking about and don't have much going on to talk about myself. As a social circle we don't seem to have many common interests besides football, gigs/festivals and getting wasted. 

I had a hot streak in early December with applications and got five job interviews in a week and a half or so, being successful in my third &amp; fourth choice, accepting my third choice. Admittedly it's still pretty good, pays better than the fourth as well, but it is further away. This sounds like a r/humblebrag, but the problem is that I barely did any prep for any. In fact I just relied on prep for the 4th choice, which came up first of the lot, probably ruining my chances in the others. Almost certainly the second anyway, as whilst they were both rather long shots, I thought that interview went surprisingly well - guess I'll never know if more prep could have tilted the balance. The job was far more interesting, the pay difference was pretty significant, plus I'd have gotten free train travel to and from work - I'm still massively bummed out about that.

All this and I haven't even mentioned the fact that I can't get to sleep before 4am. I'm still miraculously in the habit of waking up early, so I tend to get a few hours, wake up at around 8am, be too tired to move, fall back asleep and wake up at somewhere between 11:30 and 1:30, feeling like shit. 

I've looked into going Keto for a while now, but since as long as I can remember I'll take the lazy route if eating crappy junk food over even making a bowl of cereal, so the idea of meal prep is stressing me out no end, not to mention doing the shopping for it.

"I have no job, and I still haven't finished college. I have no friends, not mention a partner... When I check my social media, I see people that have all these things that I lack: confidence, money, intimacy, happyness. I know it's just a smokescreen, but I have nothing posted on social profile, because I don't have social events, no money nor a good job to help construct free time. I don't have self-esteem, because nobody will ever understand me, and I started isolating myself from the herd, because I wish I have studied philosophy, instead of computer science. And I hate computer science, because I am just playing with it. I don't master it, I don't understand it... therefore, I lack the skills to even be considered for a job position. Also, when an HR speaks with me in an interview, he can clearly see that I am a nervous/anxious person, which is not compatible with a youth environment. I just want to finally finish college and get a job in computer science! My obsession for thinking is also killing me, since I've also hold some unorthodox and pessimistic views, and I can't transmit any (but negative) emotion to anybody. I am more interested in philosophy, economy and politics, than in entertainment. I avoid thinking about or finding a partner, because it just makes me more aware about my holes, which in turn makes me realise that true love doesn't exist in this world. Love is materialistic, and you have to be an outcast, to trully realise that nobody will ever love a jobless, depressed, unfulfilled piece of shit. I honestly think that paying a prostitute is a much more honest 'relation', because you recognise that everything in life is just a transaction. You exchange a service for another, and if you don't have enough resourses, you will die worthless. Meanwhile, there will be others who will have too much, and being unaware of their own privilege, they will treat you like life was just for us all along. I have come to accept this cold lesson, but whenever I tell this to others, they look at me as if I am a mad man.

Leaving my philosophy aside, I am tempted, and I want to leave things as they are... So what if I am living with my mom at home? So what if I will work at McDonalds? So what if I will forever be alone? So what if I return home tired of working, and thinking about the meaningless of life? The thought of lost opportunities, drives me more crazy, than the thought of acceptance that nothing actually matters. This whole managing my whole life, so that I can become accepted in society, and messing things aroung, makes me suicidal.

So I leave this question to you: is it worth fighting to become part of socety or is it better to accept your meaningless to them and continue your 'unfulfilled' life, knowing very well, that you will face the monotony? I am tempted to put in practice the latter.",2,"you have to be an outcast, to trully realise that nobody will ever love a jobless, depressed, unfulfilled piece of shit"

"Bit of a selfish rant I suppose...been suffering with depression and anxiety for quite some time and currently am taking meds and starting counselling next week which has been arranged by my employer. 

Tuesday was the first day back to work after the Christmas holidays and I couldnât face going in so I told them I was working from home which was fine. Then this morning came around and I laid in bed for a good 2 hours before convincing myself to take a sick day and be alone with my thoughts (working from home wasnât an option today) 

Iâve been home all day just dotting between Reddit, naps and the Xbox recharging my batteries but everyone close to me has tried to contact me to see that Iâm ok and ask if I want to be visited. Iâve had 5 concerned messages so far including coworkers, my manager and my mother all asking what they can do to help and I just want to say âleave me aloneâ but canât be rude or ungrateful even though itâs making me feel worse.

"  All my life, I've been told (I'm sixteen right now) that ""You're in kindergarten, it's going to get harder in elementary school,"" then ""If you think elementary school is bad, just wait for high school."" I'm in high school right now and it's the worst fucking time of my life. Being told that college is much harder and that I'm going to have a much rougher time is almost too much for me to just think about. I don't feel like I could go on any longer if life still only goes downhill from here.

  Just for some background, I've always been a high honor student (then honors, but that's fine since classes get harder). I've always put a lot of weight on how well I do in school, and my parents (well, my mother) would be noticeably disappointed or annoyed when I would get anything less than my absolute best. Because of pressure from myself and others combined with some kind of anxiety disorder, I've had at least twenty major anxiety attacks directly related to schoolwork and grades. And this was just in elementary school.

  Over the course of Junior High to High School, I've developed depression to add on to (and in some ways replace I guess?) the anxiety. I feel like I have no motivation to continue on doing my work, however the fear of getting bad grades still lingers, even though I can't force myself to do anything about it anymore. On my last mid-semester report card, I was failing two classes and getting Cs on the majority of the rest. I feel ambiguously about my grades now- it's tearing me apart that they're so low, yet I feel like I don't give a fuck about doing anything about it.

  And if it gets worse from here, I don't feel I want to be around much longer. But this feeling isn't new. I've completely prepared myself and stopped just barely short of attempting suicide three separate times, each time about three or so months apart from the last. A few hours ago, I stumbled across this subreddit, and I decided I'd try something new and share what's going on online.

  I was kinda afraid of sharing something so personal online to a lot of people I don't even know, but I feel that's for the better since I feel I can't actually reach for help to the people I see regularly. My father tends to get overly worked up about these things and I feel whenever I bring up the subject he panics, spends about a half an hour calming himself down, and then completely misses that I was reaching for help. My mother is the opposite, and (I think, though I may be wrong) views my having depression as a choice and a way to get out of work, as my grades have been steadily dropping, and I've been awake and active less and less. 

  And so I thank you, everyone who has gotten this far, you've been more help to me than most by simply listening to me about my situation.

So my question is, does it actually get any better from here?

"My boyfriend told me he had been diagnosed with depression when he was 15, now he's 30. He takes medication prescribed 5 or more years ago without any medical control. A year ago he had been working with therapist for several months and since than nothing has changed (both in his and mine opinions).

From the one hand, he doesn't want to work, his parents give him money (despite it's hard for them, they both work). He is a journalist, so he can write articles but he doesn't want to. From the other hand, the only thing he cares about is ""social revolution"". He has even moved to another city to be closer to his friends in a radical organization. He participate in demonstrations and so on, but he still cannot wash the dishes after dinner. Anytime I ask him why he does nothing but ""revolution"" he tells me that he has been depressed for 15 years. In the same time he has no depression-related pain, he enjoys food and sex, he sleeps well even without taking his magic pills.

I'm an activist too, but I have two jobs, study languages and do at least something. I had two derpessions in my life, I took medication and I still visit my therapist several times a month. I know what depression is, but if I have depression and realize it than I go to psychiatrist or therapist and do whatever they prescribe. Why doesn't he even visit a doctor, if he tells he's sick?

To my mind, he is trying to get rid of any responsibility in his life, so he has ""depression"". We've been together for 2 years, I love him, everything is ok when I don't ask him about doing something. As soon as I do, ""depression"" comes. 

I don't know what to do. I want to stay with him, but not with his ""depression"". I see my father living in a kind of similar condition, and I don't want to be his sponsor or feel guilt for ""not being empathic enough"", doing whatever he needs, as my mother does.

"I feel as if depression has turned me into some sort of subhuman creature. Every time I talk to one of my friends, they tell me about their days stuffed full of classes and going out and traveling and somehow still fitting in basic care of themselves and their homes. They talk about living their best lives, and how they are in their prime. I feel like I am talking to a completely different species. 

It takes an incredible amount of mental willpower to get myself out of bed in the morning and feed myself. I can't fathom having the energy to work, go to school, take care of myself, dedicate time to friends, hygiene, cooking, cleaning, planning, and more all in one day, every day. But everyone I know around me my age seems to be managing such a busy, full life.

"For my most of my life I wanted to be a musician. My best friend and I were in a band together and we were building something.  However, as I entered my mid-20s and entered a serious relationship, I felt competing priorities and wanted to potentially pursue career paths that had more stability and less time away for things like touring. 

Since then, I've been locked in paralysis for over a year about I should be doing with my life. I feel a lot of regret about leaving the music path, yet don't feel confident enough to rejoin it either. Similarly, I feel hopeless attempting to commit myself to another path that will make me fulfilled. 

The more I think about things and analyze them, the more my brain takes me down a dangerous path of regret, anxiety, and despair. 

Any words of encouragement of solidarity would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",2,"felt competing priorities, wanted to potentially pursue career paths that had more stability "
"I went to therapy for a few sessions and the book ""Feeling Good: the New Mood Therapy"" was required reading. The book highlights unhealthy thinking patterns and trains you in how to spot them. I've found that All or Nothing thinking is a root to much of my hopelessness and causes self fulfilling prophecies. 

For example, I assume that I'm going to suck at a job and never get promoted, so I don't try hard because I view the effort as futile. The prediction therefore fulfills itself.  

I recommend this powerful, encouraging book, it's available in B&amp;N for about $12.00. It's the foundation of all modern Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that modern psychologists use.

"I'm a 38(m), and I've been taking Cymbalta for a little over a year. About 2 months ago, I started feeling very depressed again for no reason, and having bouts of extreme anger. I informed my doc, and she doubled my dose to 60mg. Since then, my depression and anger have gotten much much worse.


My life is amazing right now. I have a wife who loves me and supports me through all of my depression and anxiety issues. She is learning how to talk me down off the cliff sometimes, but it is a crapshoot as to whether she is able to or not. I have two wonderful little girls, who bring me so much joy.


Yesterday, I had a terrible day all day. I can't get motivated to do what I need to do at work, and when I do, I have terrible anxiety that I'm going to fuck something up and get fired. I spent most of the day yesterday shaking at my desk, because I couldn't even make myself move half the time. I got home, and had a fight with my wife, because I was taking everything she said the wrong way, to the point that I eventually just broke down crying for NO REASON. I cried for probably 45 minutes over nothing.


These episodes are happening more and more frequently. The last time I remember feeling this way was when I got the bright idea to stop taking my Cymbalta completely, and that was an unmitigated DISASTER. I had a complete breakdown, and nearly left my entire family. I'm terrified that if Cymbalta has indeed stopped working for me that I'm going to have to stop taking it, and will end up having another breakdown.

"Forgive me if my English has some errors. I'm from the Philippines and I'm going to try to explain this as clear as I can.

I have a friend/classmate who has a girlfriend, who we're gonna refer to as Jane. They are both helping each other out in their problems but Jane is also a victim of abuse and we're trying to go the right step in getting help and to keep her safe.

Jane is sexually and emotionally abused and her mother and stepfather do not care about her. Jane has been raped by her uncle during a reunion in her mother's province. They were supposed to go there again this New Year but she didn't come and came to my friend to talk about it to his parents (more on that later). Her mom wouldn't listen and disregards it and her uncle continues. Jane's also been getting thin these past few months. Her drunk cousin also raped her in a separate occasion. She also has a sister who's separated from her parents but makes up stories and once sued their mother and won. She's also not to be trusted and she also doesn't care about Jane and she is manipulative.

At the same time Jane also has an ex (lesbian/tomboy) who threatens to commit suicide if she doesn't stay with her. There were times when my friend got punched/slapped by her ex but my friend didn't fight back. Both of them and my friend are depressed and have thought about suicide but to calm things down Jane agreed to stay with her for a while. However her ex became too controlling and threathened to hurt my friend and she also made suicidal threats and is trying to break them up. Her ex also blackmailed him and hacked his Facebook and sent numerous messages but fortunately we got it back. Jane and her ex are both in the same school while me and my friend are in a different one.

My friend brought her to his parents and told them what she's been through and still going through. They had a talk about her family, her ex, and the abuse. They now provide her school allowance and sleep in her classmate's house and are planning to report them but it would need to take time and resources to demand them in court. But so far they are going to lay low and take some time for now.

"I was always ambitious but I became too passionate about becoming a certain thing that when it came crashing down on me that said subject wasnât for me, I died inside.

"So to get straight to the point, I have struggled a lot since puberty with, well, everything in life in general. Socially / emotionally kind of fucked, dont really want to explain the details here. 
Anyway, I have almost no (close) friends, have not ever had a relationship, that kind of good stuff.
The only good thing I guess rn is that I nearly have a bachelors degree. The downside is that it took me a really long time to get it, AND it is not the bachelor I started out in. I started out in a Engineering degree, almost but not quite Electrical Engineering (lets say 85% EE), and I got bogged down after about 1-1.5 years. The first year I did not do all that badly (though the important major subjects I failed, but I still got an average amount of credits). The second year I did worse but still not bad enough to convincingly say I should quit. The third year I failed extremely hard and basically gave up. After that I switched to a different major which you could say is Engineering ""lite"". I also switched because in the last semester I took 4 classes, of which 3 were extremely tough, got extremely stressed overwhelmed, and thus failed them all. 
I am happy that at least I almost got a degree now. But I can't really say Im passionate about what I do now. So I do not really want to do a masters degree in this field.
Could not really say that about the first major I did either. But I still find it hard to decide if that was because I am fucked as a person, or because I did not put in enough effort, or because I truly dislike the material/subject. Now I dont know what to do. Starting all over again is not an option. I can finish the first degree but I doubt I want to do the masters degree that fits with that degree. Very stressed about all this shit.

Background on my interests: been a computer nerd since very young age. Loved it. Love hardware and software. Knew very early on how to build a computer and all that stuff. At the same time learned about how to install an OS, repartition, all that stuff and really liked it. I just developed from there. Dabbled in overclocking and other stuff involving ""tweaking"". Love all of that too. Never really did any programming though. Only started doing that in college. I kind of like it but dont love it. 
I am passionate about certain music. Puberty / adolescence were awful for me. Had terrible self esteeem issues (still to a certain degree) and it fucked my life up. Shitty consequences like Social Anxiety and probably some depression too. When I most needed I did not get the help I needed. Also, those who could have helped me did not or did not understand it.
So, I got into music like Nine Inch Nails, and it has become an integral part of myself. Trent Reznor is the first person to truly make me feel less alone and genuinely seems to be someone I have important things in common with. I love that feeling. Later I found the works of MJK. I like a lot of that too. Celldweller is another good one. I like to really dig deep into the music and especially also the artists behind the music, and what makes them tick. On the other hand, I find it hard to relate on a deep level with most other human beings in my life. These people make me feel somewhat more sane, without them I would feel even more alone.
There is probably more I could write about this but I think it gets the point across.

I also like a bit of photography (tend to go through phases with that) and I like some films / series a lot. 

I like cars a lot too. I am lucky enough to own a decent one. 

Finally I like doing some sports and just general exercise. I quite like running too especially when you get runners high (sometimes I get all these big vision of ambition success which then fade quickly after).

"Over the past few years of depression, my bedroom has begun to look like an episode of the Hoarders TV show... Thankfully without the bugs. Most of the mess was me just not doing laundry. My cleanliness standards were such that I didn't do laundry more than once a month, but still refused to wear dirty socks and underwear.

So, being the high functioning depressive that I am, I would frequently buy new socks and underwear as I ran out and febreez my jeans and shirts between washes.

The underwear took care of itself as I also gained a shit ton of weight and threw stuff out as it no longer fits, but...

I'm 19 now and since around 15-16 I guess I slowly started to get more towards the state that I'm at now. I used to play a lot of video games (not to the point of completely neglecting everything else, I've always had great grades and some friends in real life) but I've slowly stopped playing them because none of them are the least bit rewarding or interesting to me.

I've tried to pick up other hobbies like reading and watching movies (they both just feel like chores that I am forcing myself to do), and I have ran cross country all throughout high school and now doing it in college through the club team at my school. It's hard to measure interest in running since it's not really something anyone does for the shear pleasure of doing it. I do feel good after a run for like an hour and I love the feeling of being impressed with my position in a 5k race and striving for a better time, but that's really it, it's not natural enjoyment I guess if that makes sense. It's all achievement driven.

I feel like I have tried so many things and I just haven't truly enjoyed an experience in the past few years. It sucks because it's killing my motivation to do well now in college because I'm starting to wonder what's the point of it all. Even socializing with people doesn't give me much joy. Probably because I'm super socially anxious and never feel like a connect personally with anyone that much other than with close friends that I've had since elementary school, which are like 3 people.

It annoys me because I hear of antidepressants making people feel numb, but it works for them because that's better than the pure sorrow and darkness that they feel in their everyday life. But my problem is actually that I feel numb, so how the hell am I supposed to treat that? 

Like I'm not even sad very often, I just am constantly bored and seeking something that actually would grip my attention. I sometimes just want to sit and stare at a wall for a few hours because it's as entertaining as anything else and requires the least amount of mental energy.

and When to say ""that isn't enough, you can't survive this way.  You need to set the goals higher, and you should/can set them higher""

But now I don't know if its what I want to do. I can't focus on the work, I find it boring and I hate studying. I feel trapped and isolated. I don't get on with other medical students - I try to be friendly but the only way I can be around them is if I'm not myself. 

Increasingly, I've been drawn to the creative industry. I would say I'm quite stylish and love dressing up and coming up with outfits. There is this creative world that exists where everyone knows each other and I want so badly to be a part of it. 

The only thing is I have no skills, talents or even interests. There is nothing I love enough to work hard at. I read a post on here that said not everyone has actual talent (although, I feel like most people do) but they work hard. I've tried loads of different things but I never like anything enough to continue with it. I've tried sewing, dressmaking, painting, modelling and styling (I did actually really like modelling and sort of liked styling but got stressed out that the outfits I chose weren't good enough). 

More than anything, I wish that I was musical. If I could be anything it would be a singer or rapper or even producer. The music industry appeals to me so much - the thought of people who've never even met me from all across the world listening to music I've made and resonating with those words and appreciating my talent is amazing to me. No other job could give that. No other job is as highly renowned. Musicians have a legacy that is never forgotten. People admire them and their talent even after death. They stand for something and change cultures. 

But again - I don't have a musical bone in my body. I wouldn't even know where to start. Every musician (or anyone hugely successful in their craft) started from a very young age - I'm almost 25. I also don't have the time. I would feel very stupid trying to do it when I don't have a natural calling or even ear for it. A girl I used to know who is now a famous singer told me that if you were supposed to be doing music you would be doing music. Everyone who is successful naturally fell into that path and worked hard at it. No one randomly says 'I want to be a rapper today' (or an actor or a fashion designer) with no experience or talent and then becomes one. 

Not knowing what I want to do and not having any talents, or even anything I like a lot; on top of the pressures of medical school, which I'm struggling with, is making me feel trapped, isolated and depressed. I see a therapist. 

There are 16 year olds who have done bigger things than me and who have more idea of what they want to do and are working towards that. I wouldn't mind if I was at the early stages of something where I wasn't very good but still knew what I wanted to do and liked that thing enough to keep going with it. I have absolutely no idea what I would want to do and be ok at or become good at, with enough work (because I don't think I could ever be good at music). I know its not supposed to be easy but I thought at least having a dream or passion would come naturally. ",2,"2 years away from graduating from medical school, Its been a long and painful journey that I feel has irreversibly damaged my mental health"
