"I keep thinking my friends are planning to hurt me. Ever time we hang out Iâm convinced they are speaking in code. I get very frustrated when I canât decipher the code. I will eventually get so frustrated that I just demand them to tell me whatâs going on, which results in them telling me they have no idea what Iâm talking about. 

Several times Iâve thought I was going to be publicly shamed  by my closest friends. I find harsh insults and threats in their speech that they always claim they didnât mean. They always say Iâm paranoid and that Iâm making everything up. 

On several occasions I thought I was going to be forced to have sex with someone and then later realized I was the only one aware of this. 

I have now severed my relationships with most of them out of fear. I donât know who I can trust anymore. I know I canât trust myself. ",3,"speaking in code, paranoid, trust anymore, publicly shamed, planning to hurt, "

"Throwaway because my other account is related to my occupation. TLDR: sick of the grind of depression, no support system, just need to get it out.

Basically, I have no will to live. I donât want to kill myself, but I wouldnât mind ceasing to exist. Iâve been like this one other time in my life-when I was 15 and hospitalized for 4 weeks. During that time, however, I did want to die. I feel like I want to crawl out of my skin from anxiety but at the same time,  I have zero energy or motivation to get out of bed. Recently Iâve had some serious financial problems, but nothing else has changed. I have an amazing job that people dream of and thousands of people would take in a second.I live in a beautiful area of the country, and I have food to eat and a roof over my head. I have a couple friends and a boyfriend and two cats. Iâm so depressed at this point that the none of this seems to matter. I just want to sleep as much as possible. 

Iâve been on and off antidepressants since I was 9 years old (28 now) and itâs been 3 solid years with none. I felt good for a long time and one of the worst parts of this is knowing that at any time, for the rest of my life this can and will return. For no reason. And I worked so hard to wean off medications and itâs very discouraging to know itâs time again. 

I have a doctors apt at the end of January to ask to be put back on meds. Definitely not looking forward to the usual 6 week haze that follows. Iâm also in the medical field, and sadly there is a pretty big stigma associated with mental health. Itâs not respected and no one talks about it. Patients with it are taken less seriously.  I feel very alone. Iâm  estranged from my family for many years and moved across the country 3 years ago and have a very small circle (like 3 people.)

I guess I just needed to get it out. And continue to analyze how Iâm going to make it and function for the next 4 weeks (and then 6 weeks for full effect of meds) and Iâm just sick and literally tired of the beast called depression. I know it can get better, Iâm just tired of waiting.

"I hate the way i look. I always imagine myself as myself, but way better. I hate my breasts they look fkn huge (But they look average sometimes which is good) I hate my shitty stomach that sticks out too much, I hate my fat arms, I hate everything about my face but I specifically hate my face shape, nose, lips and forehead. My jawline used to be so nice and prominent before I got braces, but now it's ruined.

I'm sick of people commenting on my looks. Whenever i try to feel better about myself, someone rips me down. I hate the way i look. I want to get a breast reduction but I don't have money. I am going to the gym but I feel like nothing is happening because I don't feel pain the next morning no matter how much I work out. As for my face, my braces are coming off soon and my teeth are still getting fixed so there is some hope. But I don't look the way i want to. 

It's so unfair my parents have good features and faces, whereas I don't. I hate the way i look.  This is why I have very low self esteem and another reason why I'm depressed. 

I hated how I looked for a very long time. I'm 17 and I think i have body dysmorphia disorder. I fixate on everything and constantly look at the mirror at my flaws. It sucks.

"Hello,

Ive fallen into depression again a few months ago and it got really bad a month and a half-ish ago so i went back to therapy. I went to see the psychiatrist who prescribed me meds. Im on remergon as anti-depressant, akton for anxiety and Zopiclone Teva + ergytonyl for insomnia and nightmares. 

Ive started taking them two weeks ago. Now my question: does any of you have experience with taking those meds while smoking weed? I have not smoked any since i started my meds, but im thinking about maybe having a joint when i get home (im abroad for the holidays). Would that be a bad idea? I know that alcohol can interfere with the effect, dont know what weed will do tho and im way too anxious to just try it. 

Any opinions on the matter are welcome. Thanks! ",3,"smoking weed, taking those meds"

"I have Asperger's Syndrome...it makes understanding social cues, empathizing with others (IE understanding why you made someone upset), and social interaction in general very difficult. When compounded with existing depression, it makes me feel profoundly isolated sometimes.

Things have been looking up somewhat recently - I graduated college and am currently looking for a full-time job - but the fact that I will always struggle with this disorder and find it difficult to interact with others makes me profoundly sad. A relationship seems impossible, as does sex. I don't mind living by myself and have tried to come to peace with it, but being a round peg in a world of square holes does get to you sometimes.

"I'm jacob. I'm 16 years old and I live in Minnesota. I'm posting this because I believe I had an intense moment of clarity while I was stoned. (Not the good kinda stoned) I mean where it was just too much. 

    So my buddies came over to my house yesterday. I'm usually not depressed but just a little lost sometimes. Just every once in awhile I'll get depression that will last from a day to a week usually. And one of them brought some really potent weed. And we were gonna do it both days of new year ( New Year's Day New Year's Eve.) 

    So last night was New Year's Eve. And we were smoking it. One of them didn't,  it was just two of us and we were out in my old broken pickup truck freezing and smoking weed with a lighter with almost no fluid but it worked. A bottle and a 3/4in socket pressed into a water ballon filler as the bowl. It looked stupid but it worked. And we honestly had a fun time laughing about how stupid it seemed how other were inside and we're sitting in an old pickup truck smoking weed out a bottle. That night was fun, just sitting around chilling.

    So the next day was not as fun. We were smoking some now in the morning. We smoked like 2 full bowls with low tolerance. And we were so stoned we were freaking out. It was not fun and felt very depressing and lost. The buddy that brought it had a little more than me and he got sick from it. I didn't but it certainly felt like it. While I was sitting in the other living room coming down. It suddenly struck me that I'm a nobody. That all these things that I do are not what I want to do.

    It's about school is what my realization was about. It's a pretty small school so that's nice. But that's not what it's about. It's because I always talk about how I want to drop out and all about what shitty jobs I'll have to work. And I think if I drop out then I can just sit at home and play video games and live in those games in my head. But I realized sitting there that I was wrong this whole time. It's laziness that making me not do work and not give a fuck about school. I suddenly felt that I didn't want to drop out, how I wanted to do the school work. To not be shamed for what my opinion is about it. I feel that I have just already thrown my life away. I have all Fs in classes. And I feel I just need to do better because I haven't been trying one bit all school year so far. I feel I need to change it all then I think I would be happier. 

    I'm probably not making sense at this point my mind is still somewhat foggy cause I was like tripping for awhile from the weed. Btw I don't smoke that much just every once in awhile.

    But now I'm asking for your advice on what I should do and tips to do it. I feel like I can't but I know I have to try.

    I think if I finish school and graduate. I could do what I want then. Have a place to call home. Work a job and then when not working just have fun then like video games as an example I suppose. Just thinking about how I could have my own home and to love myself and not be ashamed that I'm throwing my life away.

    I wouldn't have to be throwing my life away if I don't throw it away. Please send some advice. Thanks

I know I have a very complicated form of depression and stress disorder, anxiety and at times from all this go through phsyical pains and small spells where I hallucinate things in the dark from the constant paranoia and overthinking of every detail.

Iâm homeless in a sense - I have no friend nor family; I live with my bf and his abusive family - they are toxic to me and just as toxic to him and so much do i want to leave but where would I go? Sometimes I wanna pack up and run as far as I can but I have no money.

No job, too much debt, too much student loans so i cant go back to college nor have I been successful at jobs because I dont have much skills and well - Ive only been at two jobs long enough before my depression destroyed that.

"23F here. I have depression that comes in waves, and then recedes after maybe 6-9 months, with no warning and for no apparent reason. This has been going on since I was 18.

During these lows, I get suicidally depressed. I see the world through an incredibly negative filter until nothing seems to matter much at all. I often doubt that reality is even real sometimes, I feel so detached.

Since nothing matters and I kinda plan on maybe killing myself soon anyway, I tend to lose my inhibitions. I tend to feel so much pain that I can't expend energy pretending to be happy or living up to society's expectations. Nothing matters, and Devin's a prick, so I'm going to tell Devin he's a prick, consequences be damned! 

My depression is receding again and I am cringing at the things I did when life seemed to have no purpose. I am now having to pick up the pieces of what I destroyed in my depressive period- I'm a straight A student outside of these lows, but fail most classes during them. Next semester I plan to graduate with my Bachelor's, but I'm going to have to work hard to make up for lost time to even get above a 2.0.

Over the last few months I have cried in public, at work...I have snapped at people- depression tends to make me extremely mean. I always suspect people hate me and have bad intentions...my own grandmother, an angel on Earth, took me shopping, and I was totally pissy the entire time. This is partially because depression makes me feel physically horrible, exhausted and headache ridden constantly, but I still feel like an awful person.

While not depressed, I drink like a sane person. While depressed, I give up on moderation completely and drink as much as I want whenever I want. Tuesday at noon? Let's get blackout drunk! There is no God anyway!

Yeah, I showed up at Thanksgiving very visibly hammered, to dinner with my extended, religious family that doesn't drink. Before my depression started to melt, I just shrugged at how horrifyingly taboo this is. WHO CARES IF THEY'RE JUDGING ME? I'M BEYOND HOPE ANYWAY!!! HATE ME LIKE YOU ALREADY DO!!!

Yeah, my lows are VERY low.

"My brother in law 'has depression' and I say this because he hasn't been formally diagnosed. We live together and are quite close, but he never talks about his feelings. He went to the emergency department the other day for a panic attack and they gave him anti depressants and now he needs to see a doctor to find out what's wrong. Fair enough right, he most likely has depression/anxiety combo. 
Meanwhile he has splashed it all over facebook and messaged all of his friends. Told everyone he works with. And posted pictures of his anti depressants on facebook.
He will not stop talking about it but yet will not talk about his feelings thoughts or anything deeper than 'i went to the doctor for depression'. 
I get it if he doesn't wanna talk but everything he does makes me angry because here I am suffering in silence for the past 12 years. I finally opened up to his mum a few months ago (we're very close) about it and she's urged me to see a doctor and my boss holds me to seeing a doctor soon so I can get better and stop self harming. 
And then he turns around and pulls this shit. I finally felt like I was getting the support I needed to go and get help and he makes everything all about him. So I opened up to him about my self harm and how I've been struggling for a long long time, and he basically told me my cuts were nothing to worry about and I was clearly fine.

"Hi all fellow friends who are suffering from depression!
I have IBS, suffer from sleep paralysis almost every single night, be a paranoiac. To add to that, I had bone fractures which forced me to go through 2 painful surgeries over the span of 3 years (the first one to add a fixation device to my bone and the second one to remove it). The amount of antibiotics and painkillers I used only makes all the symptoms I have much worse. Sometimes I feel like I am the most unfortunate person in this world. And as a result, the fact that I have all these symptoms in my 20s when all my friends around me are super healthy makes me suffer from depression as well. Things have been hard for me for a few years. I don't want to go out and meet strangers and spend most of my time in my room.

However, a new year has come and I am determined to regain control over my life. I don't want to give in to these diseases that easily. I am too young and I have to support my family as well. I have maintained a habit doing exercises everyday for 2 weeks (running and hitting the gym). Now I want to start reading to understand more about all the aspects of mental health.

"Hi guys, I was just wondering whether any of you have been in this state of mind because. I can't find anything when I google it. 

I am a 21 year old male from the uk and have recently graduated and got a job out of uni. I'm from a comfortable family and my parents are still together and have been great all my life. I have a good group of friends who I see regularly, but all my life I've had a sort of apathy for living.

 I'm not sad and I'm even happy most of the time but I can't help feeling that life is fairly meaningless and it has always been really difficult for me to do anything. I don't really enjoy anything other than smoking weed and doing downers, such as Xanax, codeine and Valium. I'm addicted to weed and really struggle not to do harder drugs everyday too, but despite this I manage to hold my life together, even though I am high most of the time. For me, everything in life takes the same amount effort, from working to going out or seeing my friends, and so far I have managed to keep everything together by promising myself to do 2 constructive things a day although this has become really draining recently and I'd prefer to just lie in bed all day. 

Despite not really caring about anything I also get really irrational fits of anger and always ending up breaking stuff or ruining friendships and I don't know why. Last night I broke up with my girlfriend who knew about my weed use but not much else, although she knew I did other stuff. 

She was the thing I cared most about in life and she honestly made me care about life for a year, but for the last 6 months I've been slowly going back to not caring. I was just irrationally angry and I broke up with her for no reason and even while I was doing it I couldn't stop myself and I've fucked up the best thing in my life. I really struggle communicating my feelings with her and so I just blow up and blow things out of proportion. 

Without her I don't care about anything and I just can't be bothered to go on living everyday feeling dead inside and occasionally very angry. But I can't be with herb because I screw it up every time. 

I don't want to die because my parents would be devastated and I care about them and my sister. But I do want to be dead because I can't be bothered to do life anymore, so I was wondering whether anyone else feels like this and if you have any tips as to how to keep going with it all?

Thanks for any responses. ",3,addicted to weed and really struggle not to do harder drugs

"Has anyone just been relaxing one moment and then all of a sudden you want to punch a wall or kick something over?

Sometimes its so violent or sudden that my hand/foot jerks and it I have to physically restrain myself. In public I can cover it up with a sneeze or something, but its disconcerting.

There are also times when I'd be trying to draw then all of a sudden I just exit the application without saving or tear the paper in half, only to regret it .5 seconds later. Most of the time I'm usually either numb or kinda content but then suddenly my chest wells up and shit like this happens and I have no clue why.

"It started seven years ago, just some muscle aches, swelling, with a dull pain, which I pretended was better after some ibuprofen, but it persisted. For years now Iâve dealt with that, but dull pain is way easier to deal with. 

Iâve always had bad ankles but starting about two years ago my ankles get sharp pains when Iâm less stable, Iâm fine otherwise and I use a cane to take some weight off. Other than some weird looks I get, (Iâm under 30) it helps a lot. 

Last year I started getting a similar sharp pain in my left eye, followed by intense light sensitivity. 

Does anyone else get similar somatic symptoms?",3," muscle aches, swelling,started seven years ago"
"Hello!

I am a 23 year old female that has struggled with anxiety her whole life. I have taken many things but nothing really ""fixed"" me. Xanax and similar drugs just slowed my thoughts but didn't give me the courage or confidence to engage. Antidepressants never helped enough to notice. 

The only thing that ever USED to help, and still does time to time was alcohol. I felt I could speak clearly and engage with all types of people. I had confidence and just loved life. But obviously I can't drink every day nor do I like drinking really.

Depression has always been on and off for me. When I don't have a lot going on I get depressed. I was also pescribed an anti depressant for my migraines from the age of 15-18. I didn't know it was an antidepressant and when I forgot to take it on a trip, I had a complete emotional break down. Safe to say I STOPPED taking it. Now my depression comes and gos.

I also have a stupid past of abusing ""rave drugs.""  I have abused MDMA/molly a few times in the last 2 years. I really was uneducated at the time this could be very bad for someone with my issues and I feel like this past made my depression much worse/an actual problem. Trust me, not doing these things again. (I was very sheltered as a child so moving out was a huge learning experience)

I currently am living a healthy lifestyle. I eat pretty good and workout almost everyday but I just have been feeling HORRIBLE lately..

Extremely depressed. Nothing I used to do for fun is fun anymore. I feel this weight on my chest almost all day/everyday. I feel like all my social interactions are forced. I don't genuinely care what anyone is saying nor care to respond. And when I do to ""seem normal"" nothing comes out right or I just seem so fake.

My anxiety has been very bad. I have very negative thoughts, constantly think about my finance leaving me or people I love dying. Thinking I'm so disgusting. Literally no confidence at all. Going ""blank"" in social situations. Just not feeling human very dissociative. I run my own business and have panic attacks all the time (usually business related things cause this) or arguing.

This unmangiable feeling has been going on for a month now. Alcohol doesn't even seem to help anymore. And this sucks because I am actually very fun, intelligent and funny. I used to be the life of the party (with the help of alcohol or being comfortable with the people I was with) and now I literally can't even force myself to pretend I'm fun.

I hate living this way and really don't want to be on antidepressants.. I want to try something more natural because natural things have worked before. 

Can someone recommend something to me? I've been reading about nootropics the past 2 days and am very interested. 

Thank you!!",3," have a stupid past of abusing """"rave drugs, only thing that ever USED to help, and still does time to time was alcohol"
"This is my first time on this subreddit, so I apologize in advance if my post doesnât meet the rules. Iâve just been wanting to get everything off my chest for so long and this is the first place it seems like I can do that. 

A month ago I started seeing a LCSW because an HR lady at work recommended I take advantage of the EAP program after I spent an hour and a half bawling my eyes out in her office. I was there because I knew I was going to have to go back to the hospital and I didnât want to. I thought I could work from the hospital because I canât leave work for that long. Iâll just get that much further behind. 

That hospital at the tail end of December was my 4th stay for the year, 3rd for a crisis. I have Myasthenia Gravis, a neuromuscular autoimmune disorder that causes weakness in my voluntary muscles. I was diagnosed at 18. I grieved. I pulled my boots on and I kept going.

Except I donât want to keep going anymore. Iâm not suicidal, but the thought of having to take medicine in 3 hours and 20 minutes so I can stay ahead of the weakness makes me tired. Iâm so tired. I live my life in 4 hour increments between pills. 

Iâm 23 now. In the almost 5 years since Iâve been diagnosed, Iâve had 5 crisis events that Iâve had to be hospitalized for. 3 of those included a feeding tube. 1 of those included the flu and ICU. 

Normally I can push through and get back to routine. This time I canât. I want to cry. I am crying as I type this. I donât know whatâs different about this time. 

My counselor (social worker? Therapist? Whatâs the appropriate term?) says that Iâm depressed. She said that the first day she met me. She says Iâm scared. She thinks I should quit my job because of my âdisability.â Or that they should at least be offering me accommodations. She says that I donât tell my husband or my family how I really feel about my Myasthenia Gravis and that I donât allow them to properly support me like I need them to. She says that I need to bring them in for a session so she can mediate and I can tell them how I really feel. 

Iâm not comfortable with that. I donât know how I really feel. I donât want them to know how I really feel. I have spent 5 years protecting them from the burden that is my disease until I canât protect them or myself. My husband and my parents are the most supporting people I have ever met. My mom stays with me when Iâm in the hospital. My husband does anything I ask of him, even if it includes picking me up off the floor when Iâm too weak to stand by myself. But that doesnât mean Iâm going to allow them to see me weak. They already see my muscles weak. I canât be emotionally weak too. 

I donât know what to do about my therapist. I donât know what Iâm supposed to be accomplishing. I mostly just go in there and cry about stuff and then she tells me more about how she wants to talk to my husband and my parents. She also found out about me being a graphic designer and has asked that I do a branding campaign for her. How do you say no to someone youâve only spoken with 3 times about very private matters? Now I feel like thereâs a line thatâs been crossed and itâs not going to get resolved until I finish the work and stop the sessions. 

I donât think Iâm doing any of this right. 

My symptoms are getting worse. I didnât know that Myathenia Gravis was progressive even with treatment. It used to just be my speech and swallowing. Now itâs in my arms and legs and itâs hard to breathe. I had surgery in July to hopefully help get me off some of this medication and stabilize my symptoms. I knew that the surgery could take 2 or 5 years to work. I didnât realize how hard it would be to wait. I didnât realize that I would crash. I was as close to pre-MG normal as I had ever been and I crashed. Hard. I didnât want to acknowledge that the surgery may not work.

I just want to stop crying every time I think about it. I want to stop thinking about it. Itâs like a broken record in my head. All day every day. Except all the record is playing is static because I donât know what Iâm thinking about. Am I scared? Have I isolated myself from any help I may get? All I know is I donât want to be strong anymore. I donât want to be âyouâre so courageous for dealing with this.â I donât want to be. I just want to sleep.

"I recently opened up to a family member that I take 2 medications for my depression (and for anxiety &amp; PTSD), and I have trouble explaining how they work for me, and how I feel/think/am with and without them. I'm pretty much the same person to other people with or without the meds, but inside, the medication makes me feel more like I'm in the world/less vegetative and a lot less anxious.

"I've been on 2 different meds in the past, and they either didn't work, or wore off after a few months so I never went back to the doctor to try others. That was years ago and now my depression is worse than ever. I'm wondering whether it's worth trying other meds.

"I have been taking Wellbutrin XL of varying doses since 2012. Within the last nine months, Iâve begun feeling like my blood sugar is low all the time, and Iâve stopped exercising because I felt like I was going to pass out afterward. Some days itâs much worse than others. Numbness and tingling are part of it. 

My psychiatrist is cutting my dosage in half to see if the Wellbutrin is the culprit.

Has anyone else experienced this? It has been very upsetting to not feel good enough to exercise, but Iâm worried about reducing my dosage. Wellbutrin is the medicine that brought me back from feeling suicidal in college. ",3,begun feeling like my blood sugar is low all the time
"I have just written 5 notes to my best friends and one for my family.

"I was really happy until midnight and wanted my friends to be happy too. But after that it went straight down to doom. 
Not only did I hurt a woman I know, who works at the bar, but also cried infront of everyone. 

Worse thing, it wasn't like normal crying, it was my uncontrolable Depression-Crying. And I never did this infront of my friends. I guess I also kinda drank too much alcohol (which is why I told myself to quit it this year - wish me luck).

I'm not a person to talk about my feelings, since it mostly worsen my depression. Like it does now. I feel so bad, but I pretend like I don't remember infront of the others.

My friends think it was the alcohol, I guess. But it was just a side-effect, comparing to the true reason, which is, that 2017 was one of my worse years by now. I always thought, it will get better, I can stand this and become better at controlling it. But I haven't calculated failure and so I'm thrown back years. 

I actually think as okay of myself, but I'm suffering under the fear of what others think of me, which is so bad, when I'm thinking about new year's eve.",3, too much alcohol
