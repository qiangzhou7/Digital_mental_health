"Turns out no self-esteem for years really ruins your life. Due to this I developed major and chronic depression. Know exactly what I need to do, can't do it.

You don't just rebuild self-esteem over days, weeks, months, or even years. This takes decades. 

Decades of kindness, decades of acceptance, decades of love. It's real hard to get that as someone who feels like every breath is robbing another of oxygen.

Pretty sure it's game over for my mental health. Oh well. Maybe I can learn to live without these things but 4+ years of trying make me weary, y'know.

Anyways my life sucks, your life might suck, but supposedly life in general doesn't suck. Hard to believe I know.",1," life sucks, your life might suck"
"I'm 30 and have been depressed since 15, the age at which I realized I wasn't going to be tall and handsome and gave up on life. I get worse whenever I see porn, since I chastise myself for not having the genetics to date and bang hot women. I asked an aesthetics forum to rate pictures of me, they said 6-7, but it means almost nothing to me if it's not 9.

The one thing that keeps me from killing myself is thinking about how I could change my life around. I'm currently selling my stuff so I can afford lasik, then braces to fix my teeth. I'd also love to get limb lengthening on my legs by 3"" to make me about 6', but I have a small head and worry that I won't look good. I've done research on how to apply for gene therapy clinical trials and other radical reconstruction. I honestly don't care what the complications would be, I'm THAT unhappy. I think about suicide already, and I would end it if it happened to not work out.

I wasted a lot of time before realizing this ""my way or bust"" mindset, and I hope anyone younger than me can take away that you'll regret not solving your problems sooner if you don't start now. The depression only compounds on itself as you grow older. I'm 30, and I'm willing to put my DNA in a blender.",1,"get worse whenever I see porn, since I chastise myself "
"I feel a bit better with the drugs out of my system. I spent new year's morning on the beach till sunrise. As the sun approached, rays of orange and blue leapt between low level nimbostratus clouds painting a silky leopard-shaped canvas. Light etched it's way through the aesthetic sky-scape soon finding it's shortest path to the breakers below. I wondered if the love in my chest surfaced by this natural beauty was reciprocal in your heart somewhere.. though on second thoughts I guessed resentment  might occupy most of our space there facilitated by my loathing and misery. Take it as obsession, ill-health, whatever, I can't walk around on a broken leg with a smile on my face. I went in boots and all, young and blind as they come.. 

Here's a thought:
Perhaps staring at your weaknesses in crippling shame and regret is more likely to preserve the good in you than perpetuate failure over and over again, if you manage to recover in time.. That's a relieving thought I guess.. 

I remember when we fell in love.. I was so stupid. More words.. Just words... There's no one else.. Not that it matters..

"So on boxing day, the people I live with (Dad, step mom, step sister and little brother) went to stay at my step moms dads as it's a bit of a tradition. So I went to my moms house.

Hopefully getting drunk... again...
So we invited the old man my mom looks after for dinner. We ate, he enjoyed it so did we all then after all that we took him home. Aftet that we went to the store and brought some echo falls, dissarrono ( can't spell for shit sorry ) and coke. I'm 16 so I gave my mom the money for it lol. 

So when we got home I decided to get pissed. Nearly drank the whole bottle of dissarrono in about an hour. Totally fucked. So my retarded self decided to have a breakdown and then tell my sister that I think about killing myself every day and night and that I hate my life so much. I was a mess. But she laughed while I was in tears. Funny right? I also pretend to slit my wrists with a fork which was the first thing I grabbed out of the cookery. Kinda wish I pulled out a knife. 

She didn't say a word about it in the morning nor did my mom who was upstairs trying to sleep. 

Few dayd past, family go to my step disters cousin's family party, so I go to my moms again, and decided to jam along to my music with my mom in the kitchen, it then got to the depressing music and it ended up my mom pretending to slit her wrists and said to me ""No wonder you've been feeling depressed listening to this shit"" I wish I said to her that it helps me or some crap like that. Fun right?

"Hi,
My parents love me, unconditionally, they want the best for me, they have sacrificed a lot for me to come to where I am now, I got a high score in my final exams and I want to become a politician, but my parents won't let me because of the ""sins"" that will be committed, I am religious, the reason I want to become a politician is because my native culture is DYING in my country, the my culture is part of the majority ethnic group, our ethnic group's culture is being wiped off, the government stopped teaching my country's history so children become less patriotic, the police are corrupted, and many more atrocities are committed by the government.

It is my dream, but if I ditch my parents I would want to kill myself, I would not be able to hold in the guilt. My dad also believes that if the elders of the party order you to do something and you don't do it, because it is not moral or just plain stupid,they will kick you off the party, can't I just create my own party?

This post may be a little stupid, but I need some advice.

"Apologies for the lengthy post..
**A brief about me:**
*Personal*:I am 25 yo male,gay,was molested by a few guys at different times.I  have low self-esteem about my physique(dark toned,thin with glasses).I have dental fluorosis(dark yellowish teeth), so I never smiled or laughed with my mouth open.Became sort of addicted to porn,hookups between August 2016-May,2017-had poor performance in career. Did shitty things like cruising at public toilets/groping at busses,etc.. since 2013 at various times.
Even through all these confusions, I am quite social now with all the fellow interns. 
I never shared any of my problems because, no body gives a shit and they might take it as a way to tease me. I hate small talk/sharing of facts/any talk about movies.I usually am silent if I went for a group dinner. I find it pretty hard to talk in group,also, I do not remember such facts about which country has X resources/so on.

*Career*:Finished Masters in Engineering with above avg GPA. Got a job through campus.Now, doing a research Internship and planning for PhD.
**About current work:**In my present internship, I was given a development project which I was not interested at all.Every others were given some interesting research work.I could have finished mine earlier and switched to something else, but I am dragging the work for so longgggggg. In every weekly meeting, I just lie to the Prof. that I did something something.All the other interns have detailed slides of their past week's work, but I write it in 1 or 2 lines. So, I am the worst performing guy in the Lab(I have the potential, but the project is dull and in this period, I came to a good understanding of my behavior,sexuality,addictions and so on.Now I am on track-No hookups,no Fap,no addiction to porn).I was also addicted to chess--played for 4-5 hours straight daily while others were seriously working on their projects.

**What happened:** This New Year, I was not invited for a jungle camping which every other lab mates went.Around 10+ people went.I used to talk with everyone whenever I meet.Even I asked a guy, the day before what was his plan for New year, he said he is just gonna stay in room. Few days back, they didn't invite me for a dinner too.

I do not know what has caused them to ignore me. Most of them are from well-to-do family, but mine is still kind of unstable with debts.So, I never eat costlier outside food and wear same clothes again and again and never go out for watching movies/party. I am in the city for 4 years and have been to a few places every now and then alone and am not interested to go out nowadays.I went for a cycle ride 2 weeks back with one other girl intern without informing anyone.

**How I felt that day?**
I was pretty irritated. They gathered outside my room discussing with my roommate,before leaving for the party.My roommate too didn't invite me either.The next few hours, I was thinking what I did wrong? why they left me alone? Why that guy lied? and this affected my normal day-day activities.I took longer time than usual in everything. I relapsed to chatting with strangers for hookups and jerked off after 25+ days of NoFap. I spent around 9 hours watching porn/porn images/chat with strangers.

**How do I feel now?**
* I know God has different plans for me and this party/get together is not for me.
* I am gonna stop talking with everyone except the close ones and prove my worth by achieving a level higher than all those people.
* I started my 2018 pretty good, with some self reflection and new thoughts for my PhD admission. I am kind of between introvert and extrovert, so my room was the ideal place for me anytime.
*I set out a few goals for 2018 and I am on track.I have read 30 pages yesterday and continuing.Target: 100 books in 2018.
*I didn't drink or eat crazy and have a good start.

Though, everything is fine with me now,I would like to know any similar experiences and how people dealt with this. I am okay with not going for the party(bcoz, I would not have enjoyed as much as staying alone),but I could not handle the lie and the fact that everybody took great efforts to conceal this from me.

"Iâve been having lucid dreams due to the side effects of my meds and Iâm finding it hard to cope with them. I talked to my doctor and he told me to try taking them in the morning instead of at night but that hasnât really helped.

I also asked him for sleeping pills and they didnât help either. In fact, they made things worse as I woke up right after from a nightmare and I found myself grabbing onto the bedsheets like I was grabbing onto something from my dream. I donât remember what it was but it was the first and last time I took them.

Going to sleep is no longer the comfort it once was. Even though I get plenty of sleep I wake up feeling mentally drained, and because these lucid dreams make it seems like I was awake and dealing with real life situations that tend to be stressful and unpleasant itâs like I wasnât really asleep. Physically Iâm well rested but mentally Iâm not. Idk if that makes sense but I feel like Iâm going crazy because in my dreams I sometimes âwake upâ and think everything is normal but then previous events from the dream come back and itâs so confusing. Then when I really wake up it takes me a minute to actually realize it was all just a dream and itâs messed up. 

I told my doc and he said most of the antidepressants have similar side effects and thatâs kinda made me miserable. I donât wanna trade my sanity just to stop being depressed. Iâm honestly thinking about stopping meds again. Idk anymore.

"     You know when that feeling of disappointment when you discover that santa wasn't real and it was just your parents all along? I can't help but feel like that has been my whole life up until now.

     My life seemed just perfect until middle school. I was an optimistic social butterfly with a family that had a decent paycheck. At that time, it seemed like everything was placed perfectly and my life was the envy of others.

      When I made it to middle school, everyone would point out how ""black"" i was (My family is all white, and i happen to be slightly darker than all of them with some really coarse hair). I would tell my mother about how upset it made me, and she would reassure me that I had nothing to worry about. She said that I was slightly darker because she drank lot's of pepsi when she was pregnant (this doesn't sound rediculous when you're 13). By this point everyone at my school thinks I've gone mad or that I'm truly in denial about my skin. I wasn't, I was telling them genuinely what I thought was true. 

     When i turned 14, my parents got into a pretty hairy argument that was pretty normal at the time. My mom would be upset that my dad caught one of her lies, and she would make herself seem like the victim. My dad was pissed that she could easily make everyone feel so sorry for her (even if she was in the wrong), and he looked me straight in the eye and told me ""I'm not your real father"". I never cry... ever. But when the man tgat raised you you're entire life can just flick you off his shoulder like that. That... shit... destroyed... me.

     Turns out, my mother cheated on father she was dating my father for 5 years, and she accidentally conceived me. She tried to keep it a secret from the family and even my father.... and idk how, but she managed to keep everyone fooled. According to my cousins, aunts, and uncles, everyone already knew. She told the ENTIRE family to keep the truth from me.

    While i was in school, I couldn't look anyone in the eye. Not because i was mixed, but because I spent 2 years trying to convince everyone i was white. After this whole situation, there were two different kinds of people at my school. People that could capitalize on my misery, and the people that would sympathize me. Both of these kind of people disgust me.

     I'm 22 now and i moved out of my mothers home and now I really feel hopeless. I don't have a lot of friends, I don't feel as if I can trust anyone really. I hate the feeling of being manipulated, but i also hate the feeling of being alone. I'm beyond confused and idk how to fix myself.

TL:DR - My mother cheated on my father and I'm a result of it. I wasn't told that my father wasn't my biological father until i was 14 and it's a curse that wont go away",1,"middle school, everyone would point out how """"black"""" i was (My family is all white, and i happen to be slightly darker,would tell my mother about how upset it made me,She said that I was slightly darker because she drank lot's of pepsi when she was pregnant, truly in denial about my skin,my mother cheated on father,she accidentally conceived me"
"I mean, it's fucking awful man, I remember I used to help people left an right, and now, I don't know, I make people cry for no good reason, I feel fucking awful, I know that I shouldn't be so mean to everyone, I know that they're only trying to help, but I only know it afterwards, I only understand afterwards that I was a huge asshole, but never in the moment, and I hate it.


The feeling doesn't even stay, I make someone cry, then apologize for it because I start to understand what I'm doing, and then the next day I'm confused why I apologized, and rinse and repeat. 


The only time I feel somewhat normal is after being angry and making someone cry, because afterwards, I just can't think, my head is empty, and, it's somewhat peaceful, I don't know


I remember being there for everyone when they needed help, but now? Before they didn't even have to ask for help, I'd see it, but now? I couldn't care less about anything or anyone for that matter

I told a guy who I thought was my friend something personal. It wasnât too deep but something anyone with half a brain should know not to share. I told my âfriendâ not to share it. I only told him something personal because he wanted to know more about me. So I opened up. But I also told him not to tell people about my family. I thought he was cool and we were friends for a couple weeks. I was new to making friends after deciding to open out of my shell. But now that this asshole tells people lies and rumors about me it just broke me. He tried texting me saying he didnât say anything but obviously Iâm not that stupid. This seriously just broke me down. I hate people who use me for company. I just canât trust anyone or make friends. Now the school thinks Iâm a crazy weirdo.

"There's no sugarcoating it really. I have a history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor. I'm 18 now and everything was going great since my birthday (septemeber). I was about to graduate, I had a girlfriend I adored, friends always wanting to do something, and I just generally felt happy. Until early December when my abuser came back into my life ( and I'm too much of a bitch to tell amyone other than my best friend ), one of my friends became toxic and we've slowly distanced, and then my girlfriend dumped me. I was actually dealing with everything well enough but her dumping me was the straw that broke the fragile camel's back. Short anecdote, but my first girlfriend and I broke up in April. I being a vulnerable 17 year old idiot, decided to go on tinder and just find someone, someone who could fill that void. Instead of dating though I just fucked. And not in a good ""I'm having so much sex it feels great!"" kinda way, but more in a last ditch effort for a sense of validity and feeling wanted, followed by complete resentment and disgust in myself afterwards. My current ex helped me not live like this anymore back in June, but then she ended things on the 27th. It was after a long text about all my problems that was induced by a severe overload of anxiety. I don't feel like she's not justified, I just wish I hadn't sent her that. My mind instead of talking it out or anything instead defaulted to my old habits. It's been one week and I've had a one night stand with three different people. I hate it, I never feel macho or confidence boosted after just gross and shameful.

Sex and I have always sorta been like that though. I mentioned my abuser, in short she molested and raped me multiple times through blackmail when I was 15. That's how I lost my virginity. I get that society places too much of an emphasis on it but my first sexual experience was while I was crying, screaming for her to stop, and being berated. I would have preferred better. So after then I just stopped caring about it or myself and just did it whenever I was with someone willing to do such. I always convince myself though, that the person I'm about to have sex with will be someone I want to be with, but that's never the case, yet I keep falling for it. I feel like a sociopath, I keep using other people for a fucked up sense of emotional relief, a way to forget about my ex-girlfriends, to forget about how much I used to care, and to convince myself I've always been this way, I just hided it.

I don't even know if half of this makes sense. I'm not even fully aware of why do it to be honest I think I'm addicted but I'm too terrified to admit that. This is more me just venting about being a manipulative cunt. Rarely do people ever actually read what I post, which usually leads to me deleting them, but if anyone is reading this, can you just tell me if I'm a horrible person for doing this because I can't help but feel as such.",1,"history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor"
"I might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out. 

Most of the time I start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends (as if) and an interesting life, like in a cartoon adventure or something. Sometimes I even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that could've happened. 

It's starting to become more and more frequent and I'm finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head. Then reality comes crashing down and it feels horrible when I realize my crazy fantasies will never happen. 

It's just so much better in my mind. Anyone else?",1, horrible when I realize my crazy fantasies will never happen.
"I should have done this a long time ago.

Let me begin by saying that I am a proud man.  I like to think I'm self-sufficient, and that I'm equipped to deal with the crap the world throws at me.  I'm not accustomed to asking for help, especially when it comes to my illness.  You see, no one in my family knows I suffer from chronic depression, because I have never been diagnosed as such.  But the truth is I've spent the majority of my entire life battling self-loathing, feelings of hopelessness, and thoughts of suicide.  And as I slog through what must certainly be a mid-life crisis, it's getting harder and harder to deal with on my own.

I am very slight of build, and I was bullied mercilessly as a child and teenager.  I learned to fight back, and have spent most of my life unwilling to put up with others' crap.  That has really hurt me socially and professionally, because everyone thinks I'm an asshole.  I'm now in my 40s, and I don't have any friends anymore, and don't really have much to do with my family, other than my mother.  I love her, and she loves me, but she's a tyrant.  She has supported me financially for years, and she's not afraid to remind me of that at every opportunity.  She's approaching her 70s now, and her health is deteriorating, leaving me as the only member of the family who would even consider caring for her (everyone else in my family draws disability or welfare, even though they're each perfectly capable of working, but none of them would lift a finger to care for my mother, so that falls on me).

I went to college, where I did very well.  I have a bachelors degree in music education, but after graduating I discovered fairly quickly that I can't stand children (much less their overbearing parents).  So I am now thousands of dollars in debt (student loans) that I can't afford to pay, all for a degree in which turned out to be a waste of time. I was never a particularly stellar performer, so that avenue is closed to me as well.  However, I've spent the past 20 years writing and arranging music for school bands and band instruments in a bid to validate going to college in the first place and salvage some sort of professional career, and some dignity.  Unfortunately, composing and arranging pays little to no money...certainly not enough to pay bills or better myself.  The truth is, I'm an outcast in that world, because again, I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to tell music teachers when they're not doing a good job.  So I feel that door has closed as well.

Since graduating college, I've had to resort to what amounts to a string of odd jobs which I've absolutely hated.  Customer service, human resources, retail, grocery, sales....all soul-crushing, tedious jobs that have always made me feel like a complete and utter failure in life, and wishing that writing music was a sustaining career.  

About 10 years ago, I got involved in a relationship with a woman who nearly ruined my financially.  It took me a long time to bounce back from that, but I did.  I had to move back home, though.  Unfortunately, since then, I've had an incredibly difficult time finding work at all.  I live in the rural south, where the only good paying jobs are in nursing and truck driving (neither of which I can do, nor would ever want to).  I can't even get a job flipping burgers or working in a grocery store, because I'm a man in my 40s with a degree, and am (according to employers and staffing managers) overqualified for anything short of, according to them, brain surgery.  Factories won't hire me for the same reason (and also because I cannot lift more than 40 pounds).  I'm subscribed to dozens of different job websites, and can't count the number of times I've nearly been scammed by fraudulent job listings...the sort that prey upon desperate people like me.  I've wasted thousands of dollars in gasoline driving to places of business in order to apply, only to be told ""You have to apply online"", and am then ridiculed by friends and family who assert ""You have to go meet employers face to face if you want to get hired"".  

In the past I've actually moved around the country in order to find work, but I've always been held back by 1). There's no such thing as a permanent full time job anymore, and 2). The extremely high cost of living, and anyway, as my mother gets older, that's no longer an option.  I'm stuck here, and I'm going broke.  If it weren't for my mother, I would be homeless, and just a few days ago she informed me that ""we're"" moving from a decent house in a quiet neighborhood to a mobile home next to a railroad....the last thing in the world my ego and self-esteem need right now.

I don't have health insurance.  I can't even afford it.  The state I live in doesn't offer Medicaid,  the premiums are too expensive on even the cheapest plans, and the copays at my local health department are too expensive.  My student loan is on deferment until they get tired of me requesting deferments (which may very will be next month).  I've been dealing with internal and external hemorrhoids for a decade, and I can't afford even have them looked at, much less do anything about it.  And I certainly can't afford therapy, or counseling, or medication for this depression.   Coupled with the fact that I don't even want to get out of bed most days, combined with the fact that I'm not getting any younger...I'm beginning to see the writing on the wall.

I'm a proud man.  I don't like to ask for help.  I don't want to apply for welfare or financial assistance, because 1). I most likely wouldn't qualify for it, and 2). to me, that's admitting total defeat, and surrendering any shred of dignity I have left.  I certainly don't like to ask for help from strangers on the internet, because frankly, I think it's a total waste of time and effort.  But I can feel a darkness creeping up on me, preparing to strangle the very life out me.  I see no hope for a future.  It just makes me so angry.  I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I've stayed out of trouble, and I don't bother anyone.  I worked very hard to better myself and, for my part, I've been a good person.  I don't care about money or wealth.  I just want a sense of purpose in life.  I want to be able to pay my bills and actually buy things I want rather than just what I need.  I want to be respected for my talents, and maybe even remembered when I'm gone.  But all of that seems totally out of reach now.  It's infuriating to see my suggested earning potential on job sites ($89,000 per year, btw), and then get a prospectus from Social Security letting me know that as of right now, when I turn 65 I'll only get $330 a month.  That makes it feel like everything, my education, my work history, my entire life...has all been for nothing.

I don't know what to do.  I applied for over 20 jobs today, and I won't hear back from a single employer because I'm a forty-something with a college degree.  I'm tired of being supported financially by my ailing mother.  I want to support HER.  I want to be able to afford an apartment at the very least, and not have to move into a damn trailer less than 20 feet from railroad tracks.  I want her to be proud of me.  I want my college professors to be proud of me.  I want to be proud of myself.  

But part of me also wants off this ride.  Part of me is afraid things are not going to get better.  How can they?  I'm running out of ideas.  I'm running out of options.  And I'm running out of patience.  I just don't know what else to do.

"Nothing Happens


Staring at the white wall I trace the rectangular patterns with my wet eyes and the pain strikes me again along with the voices. âGaby, youâre such a fuck up why are you even alive?â I cover my ears while I shake my head repeatedly. I lose control. In a plane falling out of the sky what can one do but brace for death? Every negative happening thatâs ever happened is replaying in my head, spun around where Iâve become the problem. The angle of death. The one thing that makes sure everything goes wrong. I see this seemingly true image of myself and I feel disgusted. The voices start yelling ugly words at me digging at my festering wrists. They wanna see blood but I wont give it to them. My whole body shaking, little puddles of tears on the floor, eyes like a madwoman the voices start screaming. Banging my head against the wall until my fight for survival becomes a fight for death I slump down, my head throbbing with a sharp pain in my skull. I laugh.

"Hey all.  
Sorry if I seem like I'm just dumping a lot here, I just feel I need help thinking through some issues. 

The big thing is a pretty damaging vicious cycle. I'm awful depressed because I'm lonely and feel I'm the only guy my age (22) who hasn't dated anyone, or even had any close friends I could trust and talk to. Never really hung out with anyone. Though I wish to change that and make a few friends in college, but not only do I not know how to go about it even though it's my third year, but I just feel that nobody would care about me. In fact, everyone from high school completely forgot about me, even before graduation, and we're a small class and everyone knows everyone's name. 

There's a lot of things that drift through my mind when I try to work through this, and I just get overwhelmed.  

A number of things leave me feeling worthless about myself.  

I happen to be mildly autistic, which honestly I don't understand much about it, but in school, word spread about it and plenty of people started talking to me as though I was retarded, even a few that knew I was just like any of them. I should be able to just get over that, but... you can only wonder if people are telling you that you're intelligent and capable out of pity so many times before you start getting paranoid.  

Plus, I see tons of other people who seem to have good friends they're always hanging out with, but I never know how to introduce myself to someone, honestly I'm scared I'll make an ass of myself. Enough that I literally get paralyzed when I try to talk to someone, my jaw seizes up and everything. But I'm ok with people approaching me, which never seems to happen, it's only happened once in my life. This makes me think, is the easier problem to fix that I struggle starting conversations, or that nobody wants to talk to me? 

I've got pretty bad image issues, too... I know that it's almost impossible to find a guy who'll say it, but there it is. I won't say I'm a heavy guy, because I don't look particularly bulky, but I... look up gynecomastia and you got me. I look like I've got boobs, and yes I'm a man and *hell* no, I'm not trans. I've been trying to work out and loose them, but while I've been loosing some weight they're not really being affected. I'll never look good in a tee shirt like this, it seems, and that's kinda why I'm struggling to start an athletic lifestyle... again, vicious cycle I gotta break out of. 

Lots of things to work through here... I feel absolutely overwhelmed. ",1,"happen to be mildly autistic, in school, word spread about it and plenty of people started talking to me as though I was retarded,"
"I hate myself, i hate everything I am.  I wish I didn't.  Or maybe I really don't.  Maybe I just can't take the negative thoughts, the pain, the apathy, the endless battle you can never win anymore.  I feel like I'm worthless, like I mean nothing to anyone.  I'm always trying to live up to impossible expectations from a person that doesn't exist.  I hurt, and hurt, and hurt and hurt so much that my heart may as well explode and nothing changes.  I go to bed, I wake up the next day and repeat that for however long I get to till I'm back here.  Knowing that there will never be a point where I don't come back here till the day I die.  

Why don't I get to be normal?  Why don't I get to be happy without the looming sadness and anger?  What did I do to deserve this?  Is it because I exist?  Not letting me live wasn't enough punishment.  I had to be cursed to live a life where I wake up everyday hating myself more and more and more till the white noise becomes a ringing that becomes banging in my head screaming ""YOU ARE WORTHLESS"" in a mask of my own voice.

"I often think about ways I could maybe kill myself. Like stabbing a kitchen knife into my heart or stepping in front of a bus. I donât know if that would work or if Iâd ever actually do it but the thoughts are there. 

Sometimes I feel like I want to die. Like I donât care if I died or not at that moment. But sometimes I donât want to at all. Does that make sense/is that normal? 

I was raped a few years ago but have never spoken to someone professional about it. My husband knows but he doesnât speak about it and tells me I should talk to someone if I want to. I donât know if he just isnât the kind of talking person or if he doesnât actually care - it was a mutual friend of ours and he knows that. 

When I watch tv programmes or see news articles of people getting raped I get really angry, I think this might be when I start thinking about ways I could die. If I was dead Iâd never have to be reminded or think about rape again. 

Some days my thoughts overwhelm me and I donât want to get out of bed. I want to get up and have a nice day but something just seems to stop me. I donât know what and I just feel really shit and down. 

Am I just being stupid? Or is this something that is normal? Should I get professional help?

"So I have been effed up in life several times. I've got quite a background with depression , rejection and bullying. I'm 21 and I feel like my life is already doomed, like there is no way out of this.

I've been struggling with paradoxical feelings, because I met a girl who I've fallen in love with, but she has bpd and got a full time job. We rarely speak now, only in March will she be available again. She makes me feel good about myself, like the only thing that truly makes me happy. I care about her so much, so I am letting her set her life straight and not talk to her. She's rarely in the mood anyways, as she gets home too tired to talk or too depressed. She told me she loves me, but she's not ready for a relationship yet. I'd love to heal her and make her happy, regardless of being in a relationship with her or not. I just want her to be happy. That alone, would make things better.

I struggle with some kind of mental illness. I can't say what it is, since I've never been diagnosed. I believe, however that I have depression and/ or avpd.

Also, she lives in another country and I'm scared that if I meet her in person, things will change. Like, she will stop liking me. I'm very awkward in real life and can't express a fourth of what I write.

I'm scared of completely deliver my heart to her, although I do trust her. But, I just have a feeling that she may not want it, since she mentioned she's not ready for a relationship yet.

She's been with abusive exes and has a rough past, which is no wonder she is trying to protect herself.

So what should I do? We are both afraid, but we love each other. We are planning to eventually meet up one day. But that is what scares us. We are afraid of hurting each other and being hurt. Maybe because it may won't work out, not because we would actually hurt each other.

She's my everything. This is the first time I felt such strong feelings. I am numb on the inside, but when I am with her, all my demons fade away.

It frustrates me being so useless to her. I want to do something for her, but she's been to busy. We haven't spoken in more than a week. It will probably carry on till March or something.

I've been severely depressed. Talking to close friends helps a bit, but my closest friends are online friends. My real life friends are not that close and I don't feel comfortable with them.

The darkest thoughts have been running through my mind, and I've been idealizing suicide lately. The only thing that keeps me from doing it is that I have family who loves me, and I have online friends who are also family to me. If I ever did it, they would not know about it, I'd just become inactive forever, and that would certainly pain them more than my family since they would not know if I was dead or not.

Even so, I don't know how long I'll last. Don't mean to be pessimistic, but things aren't looking okay. I feel like my feelings don't make sense and that my thoughts are too confusing. It's becoming unbearable ",1,ejection and bullying. I'm 21 and I feel like my life is already doomed
"My adventure with depression started at start of middle school. I went to new school with many thugs. I am a quiet, peaceful, so I was bullied harshly - like throwing lit matches at me, laughing at my acne, once whole gym with 70 people laughed, because I couldn't make a simple exercise, dog barked when we were coming back from school and they said ""Even dog doesn't like you"". To add fuel to the fire, when I came back home parents were screaming at each other, because of my alcoholic father and financial problems. I was totally alone with all the problems and it seemed like whole world is against me.

After few months I changed school with ""normal"" people not thugs. However something changed in me. The world was dark, I had negative thoughts about myself, world and others 24/7 like ""I am worthless"", ""People are evil and want to use me"", ""People are suffering around the world"". I had nightmares everynight like I was holding injured man on apocalyptic landscape and there was an atomic alarm, on the sky there was a sign ""magnetic field can kill you"" then I woke up screaming, but the real world looked like in this nightmare. There was no escape. At start I fought with it, but after a while I accepted this dark world. I watched dark movies, listened to dark ambient etc. This lasted 6 years. I tried many SSRI's, but nothing worked. 

At the end of high school I started experimenting with dissociatives like ketamine. They helped me a little, but at the end of school I tried to commit suicide and was sent again to psychiatrist. He gave me venlafaxine and it was miracle. It changed my world in 30 minutes, color started to be brighter, mental pain wasn't there, no negative thoughts, doing things started to be pleasurable again. I mixed it with dissociatives, because there are studies linking ketamine as useful with depression treatment. Now, after 3 years I don't use ketamine or SSRI's and my world looks like heaven. I feel good all the time, no negative thoughts, have motivation to do things, colors are bright, no nightmares, normal self-esteem (while in depression I thought that I was a complete shit and shouldn't even breath, because of waste of oxygen).

"I grew up being raped and molested by my step dad from age 5 to 11 and once by an uncle at age 7. I have witnessed 7 suicides in my life, 4 of them infront of me and the others I walked in on after it was done. I have been beaten daily till I was bleeding or my step dad got tired of hitting me from age 5 to 17. I was homeless from 18 to 27, I never knew my real dad but for a few months before he died of liver failure, I was 23, then at 25 my mother committed suicide. at the age of 37, I have PTSD and severe depression and severe social anxiety. 

for the past 8 years I have been on this site and many others trying to find someone to build a connection with, get close too, make memories with, share things with, eventually build a life together and become a serious couple that settled down.

For the past 8 years I have been told I am ugly, disgusting, worthless, useless, told I have nothing to offer anyone, told I don't deserve love or a relationship or a woman, told I need to kill myself.

For the past 8 years I have been lead on by a couple women who pretended like they wanted me and was interested in me and after 5 or 6 months of this, they would fake their death or call me having sex with someone or disappear then turn around and stalk me.

I have been rejected over 2 thousand times in the past 8 years all because I am obese, I struggle with low thyroid, a very slow metabolism, and genetics from both parents being obese, and just found out that I have very low testosterone, although I have a high sex drive. All of these issues plus my PTSD effects my weight and makes a breeding ground for obesity as my Dr. has put it. I walk 3 miles a day, I eat healthy, baked chicken, boiled veggies, etc. I stay away from soda pops but once a week I will drink a soda, once a month I will eat a pint of ice cream. it helps me stay on track and away from fast food and deep fried stuff. But it doesn't matter, because of my health issues that are causing the obesity.

But see, yet no one wants to get to know that about me, no one wants to get to know anything about me, they just see the outside of me and what income I have then reject me. No one cares for who I am as a person, no one cares for how I am as a person, no one cares what I am like as a person, no one cares about my personality or attitude. No one cares how I would treat them. They just see my weight then walk away.

I may not have much in the looks department to offer, I may not have much in the money department to offer. But what I did have to offer was pure true unconditional love, true loyalty, a heart filled with pure love and a mind filled with acceptance and understanding. someone who wouldn't ever cheated or left, or ever played mind games, someone who would been so loyal to you, someone who would have treated you with gentle care and love. someone who would been very romantic and devoted.

Well, I give up looking, I am done looking. I am to the point I just don't care if I ever find anyone or ever be with anyone. well this is my good bye letter to all the women on here. I hope many of you who I crossed paths with are proud of yourselves for how you did me and how you treated me. and for those of you who I never talked too, sorry we never got a chance. if you would have given me one.

"Hello there.

First of all, this isn't an 'emergency' or something, I'm not suicidal and I know I'll get over this depression, but maybe somebody can help make it quicker.

I'm a 27 year old male and about 5 months ago I lost the parent who raised me. I was fat most of my life, except for a few years when I was a teen. I'm 5'10 (178cm) and 285 pounds (130kg) atm, I'm really unhappy with my body and my voice. I'm not handsome by any standard and I'm poor too (and I'm getting bald).

Recently I fell in love for a girl but she lives in US and she's smart and beautiful, I'm from western Europe and I don't have the money to go to US. If I had the means to go I'd surely at least try even though I know I'd probably be rejected (like, 99.9% of chance). I have a lot of responsibilities here too. I'm losing weight but it's probably going to take a few months/years to reach my ideal and even when that happens I guess I'll have loose skin. The fact is: I wouldn't want to date someone like me, how can I expect others to? Please don't come up with that acceptance thing, although I really appreciate the good intentions I just can't change what my brain finds attractive or not.

I've never been with a girl I loved ( or not :P ), I've only loved 3 girls so far, one when I was 17 and I was slim and such, but I didn't have the balls to express my feelings. Then again when I was I guess 20 or something, I wasn't very obese so I was somewhat OK with my weight, but the girls was from Australia and we didn't even have the time to know each other better.

People keep saying that's a 'crush' or something, but that's a start isn't it? I mean, I don't feel like approaching girls I don't feel something strong for and I totally don't believe 'real long-lasting love' will emerge from a forced relationship. A girl once wanted to approach me (but I was in love with that 2nd girl) so I suppose I'm not unbearably ugly but I certainly can't compete with the other guys in terms of looks.

I've been working my 'bottom' off for some time now, and I hope to make some money to be financially comfortable, but I don't want a girl to like me because of that, while I surely plan to use some of the money to improve myself.

I like smart girls with strong political opinions and definitely I don't like 'good' girls that are OK with everything and always trying to avoid conflicts. This girls I'm in love with really seems the perfect match, I honestly never been so sure about that, but I simply can't have her.

So, this is the situation I'm facing at the moment, my heart aches so much but I don't express it to others. I don't have anyone to talk about that only my dog and although that helps a bit it doesn't count much.

I'm trying to focus on my work to forget her but I can't. Everything I see feels familiar in a way that reminds her, this is something I never felt before, even looking at this text somehow I remind her face. Maybe there's a hormonal imbalance or something. I'm certainly not discarding the possibility of a physiological effect.

So, sorry for the big text and thank you for reading it. I'd really appreciate any advice on that. Thank you very much.

"Hey, /r/Depression/ . I'm not sure whether I want to post here or in /r/SuicidalWatch/ as I'm having mixed feelings.

I'm from the type of people who pays attention to the detail, so let me give you some background. I'm a 19-y-o boy working as a waiter, which job was wrapped up by my grandmother. Yeah, living with my parents, and grandparents. I'm living in a very advanced level of poverty... even this is a miracle considering the chances, in my country, of being employed solely on a diploma.
This is the job I've started off after living 4 months of unemployment. I really f|cking prefer living my whole live unemployed, rather than being employed in such a sh|tty job. ""Why don't you just change your job? Or the very least, change the workplace?"" It's not as simple as that. No one hires. This just as in, because you really do need a good certification or degree from (preferably) the... richest... places. E.g. Microsoft certification, or an Oxford degree.
Now let me tell you about the job I'm stuck on working. Every. goddamn. day. And I'm almost wanting to cry typing this, because it only reminds me of what I'll have to face tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and et cetera. I don't like my job, because co-workers, I don't like the F&amp;B Manager (Food and Bar Manager), I don't like the boss, and the clients, towards which I force myself to have positive feelings, because I'm a waiter, and this is a positive, and a default trait.
I'm an outsider working with not-so-intelligent co-workers, but very experienced in the field. It's because I'm new and know nothing about this genre. No one teaches me anything regarding how to work, and how to work the work. When I try to do something on my own, I usually fail, because no one offers a hand (referred as to teaching), then the staff of the whole hotel (the workplace) gather togheter, talking to each other that I'm incompetent, I'm stupid, they laugh at me, and feel a relief telling me ""You aren't good for anything. Better quit this job as soon as you can. It's the same even if you're working. You're only causing troubles, and issues."" 
A usual worker would think, ""Well, it's not an estimation by a manager."" But the thing is, my co-workers are very close with the manager, and always whine to him how I'm not good for anything. If I try to 'raise my voice' (figuratively), I always get a huge backlash of bullshit. I.e. there has been a problem, and I'm not in fault, but if it is in correlation with the experienced co-workers, it usually is my fault. Kind of a handicap. It got to a point where my manager cuts a lot of tasks, duties, and obligations, because I'm 'incompetent'. Today he saw me trying to carry 2 things at once, and got irritated, then told me by a very unpleased voice and body language 'Just stop trying to multi-task.' But I usually am good in multi-tasking, but the cowardice feeling (anxiety closy-by [It's really not anxiety, but I really do get VERY scared]) of having someone around me that watches what I'm doing, and probably expects the failure. And it really increases the chance of failure.
I really do have a friend of mine in the staff, but this can't really compensate anything. I have (had) friends, with which I've lost contact long time ago, and basically what I'm doing in life currently is go home, sleep, and to work again.

[#The Having Positive Feelings Towards Thoughts Of Death]
I usually watch entertaining or educational videos, which I've watched before, but the difference is that now I don't feel anything. I just feel depression, which cannot leave me. When watching utensils, I get a little uplifting feeling, which is caused by thoughts of harming myself. I really can't do anything about it, nor can you. The premise is that I want to get A LOT of weight off of my burden.

This is the life I'm living. Handicapped. It literally feels like you're tied, and can do nothing else, but to accept hard hits. Thank you for paying attention... not even the guests of the hotel are That merciful.",1,"I'm an outsider working with not-so-intelligent co-,the staff of the whole hotel (the workplace) gather togheter, talking to each other that I'm incompetent, I'm stupid, they laugh at me"
"Sorry, this is my first reddit post ever because I'm really good at lurking but not at contributing to anything. I'm starting my second semester of college at IUS soon, and I'm really excited because it's my only way I get to go out and do things besides staying home and slowing drifting towards wanting to die. 

Every day I hope I make a new friend but I realize I'm wrong and I go home feeling like shit because I feel like everyone thinks I'm as shitty I as I feel I am. I asked this guy I liked out after I embarrassed myself the day before and I fucked everything up; I lost all chance of dating I had with him. Everyday is just another day for me to feel lonely. On the last day of drawing class we had I started violently crying before class at my easel because I'm a weak piece of shit. I got a 3.5 gpa on my first semester back though and that makes me feel really happy.

I can't even think of what to say when I try to talk to people; I always draw blanks in my mind and I end up just awkwardly being there with nothing to say and nothing to contribute. I'm only able to be friends with people who are able to put up with my shit and are able to put effort into being with me because I'm barely putting enough effort into being alive.

I still have hope though that good things will happen to me and make me feel like I'm an actual person and not a corpses that just goes day to day doing nothing.

Every minute, I compare with others about everything.

How managed to get what they wanted at a much earlier age than I do. 
How they manage to get a hold of their own life but I ever did. 

How much I keep comparing grades *(which is my greatest weakness because I focus on it too much on a daily basis but I end getting bad grades anyway because my anxiety keeps killing me ... makes me procrastinate and black out and give up)*

Every day I am shaking the minute I wake up. 

Every day, I feel like I have this need, this compulsion, this must to be better than everyone else in every way ... but I am too weak. 




I am paralysed in that endless competition against others and everyone else in this world goddamned planet and at the same time, I lack the slighest motivation to even do the slightest change because I give up before I even do anything because I have an inferiority complex, one that I feel like I am an ant among giants or gods.

*(or when I did make a move to be better, I pushed so much that it took over my life. An obsession that became so invasive and destructive that instead of my mind verbally and psychologically abusing me in one way, I allowed it to abuse me in a different way. When I did want to make a change, I went too far and it became dysfunctional)*

In my head, I feel like I am at war. I feel like I am in an endless bloody nightmare against my own head. Sometimes, I even lay down my arms before it starts because I am too exhausted and fed up of fighting over and over and over and over again.

On the outside, I feel frozen. I am shaking every day. Even right now, I am shaking because I am constantly being reminded on how much of a pathetic, weak and ungrateful little bastard I am because no matter how much I try, no matter how much I wanted to push myself, I never am able to do it.

When I try to be better, I fuck up. I panic, I feel like giving up, I feel like I running through a battlezone where there are a thousand bombs exploding everywhere, terrified as hell. I feel little and weak and scared.

I feel like I am walking on a thin rope but I am shaking because I am scared. 

I feel like a thousand voices are screaming inside my head constantly all the time. They make me shake even more and because of that, I end up falling

Again. And again and again.

Sometimes, I even fall on purpose because I want to hurt myself because even though I have that compulsion to be better, I give up immediately.

It's like when there is a bully who is about to beat me, I beat myself instead just to save the time and energy and because I deserve it.

So I do that over and over and over again. From the minute I wake up. Every minute, I feel like I am in a battle between myself and my self hatred and more often than not, my self hatred wins.

So I beat myself. Over and over again.

And then I keep noticing how much I hate myself and because of that, I feel pathetic. I feel despicable.

And when I compare myself to others, that is the perfect fuel to add to the fire that is already burning me from the inside while I am tied up with my mouth shut.

I sit on my chair or stay on my bed, staring at the wall, or looking at the paper that I am supposed to write. I end up staring at it for hours, because I even lack that tiniest skills or the tiniest effort to push myself to even do it. But even if I did try, I know that I don't want to ""just try"", I want to go all out. 100%. ... No, 200%. 300%. I want to be the best. The best of the best. But I feel pathetic either way. So, I don't do much effort. 

So I get bad grades or fail .... another perfect fuel to the fire. 

My mind feels like it hit the gold mine. It has the perfect tools to make its bitch. It has me chained like an animal and it slaps and belittles every minute.

I look at others, I don't see people, I see numbers and qualities, those who have beaten me, those who I need to beat, those who I am already better than them and those who I absolutely can never beat.

All of them, my mind will still find ways to make its bitch even more.

And no matter how hard you try to focus during the exam, you can never focus because I am always there. No matter how hard you try, there is always a genius much, much better than you""**

Every day I go through this. Every day I have to put up to this. Every day I have to keep on going through this torture.

A world like this one, a world where everyone is constantly competing against each other, whether it is people competing for more likes on social media, or competing who has the higher grades or more income, or who has the better girlfriend and has the better sex, or has the happiest life, or who is more successful and able to beat his competition, or who is able to get the job he wants and the rest keep struggling and maybe even end up poor, a world where misery has become a means of humouring people like social media likes to poke fun of other people's flaws and failures, or the news likes to cause drama and panic when someone makes a mistake or something happens, no matter how big or small, or teachers and parents or people in charge, telling you what to be or not to be, how to dress, eat, drink and write, what to think or not to think, how you should be or not be. 

Plenty of people around, often looking for whatever faults and regrets and flaws you have, so that they could exploit it and take advantage of it and make you worse, 

Not to mention the internet, how much it is so full of trolls and cyber bullies who want to make you feel like you are the worst person on the planet, just because they can ....

 ... just the right kind of drug to give this bully, this abusive mind of mine that I was somehow chosen to have with me on a daily basis, the right kind of negativity and anxiety and torture to make me feel like I sold my soul to the devil and I deserve all that suffering.

That constant anxiety. That constant terror.

It is so much easier to just grab the rope and end it right there. 

Why would you choose to keep experiencing this day by day, night after night?

______________________________________________________________

Even right now, as I am typing this, I am reading and re-reading what I wrote, I am constantly shaking, I cannot think clearly and my mind is keeping a sharp eye on whatever spelling mistake or grammatical error or how much I sound like a person whose language are as poor as a mentally retarded person because his anxiety is so high everyday that he cannot think clearly at all, that mind is like a bully behind me, waiting to strike when I am at my most vulnerable. When I feel ashamed for a mistake that I made. When I am reminded about a past grade that I wished I could have done better. When I lost someone who cared about to someone else.

I often wish that I could grab a gun and shoot myself in the head. Maybe I will make that voice in my head shut up once and for all, but then again, it will still win anyway. Suicide is for cowards and pussies anyway ... and it calls me a coward and a pussy everyday.

If I keep breathing air in this damned planet, it will find a way to make me suffer and win anyway in the end. If I just end it, it will win either way. 

It's like fate has already decided isn't it? It's as if fate has put a curse on me and I cannot do anything about it",1,"the inferiority complex,  Icomapre with others,I look at others, I don't see people, I see numbers and qualities, constant terroe, constant anxiety"
"I found out accidentally last week that all of my friends are going to another one of my friend's party. I was not invited. My one friend who isn't going isn't responding to my texts. So now I'm alone at my house with Chinese food and beer. This past month I've felt more alone than I've ever have and i don't know how to deal with it. I'm starting to realize my place in friendships as the excess, the one who is forgotten or dismissed. This NYE was the icing to the cake. I'm hoping that 2017 will be better but it's not promising. Does this feeling of loneliness ever get better? Im scared that if I don't do something about it, it'll spiral out of control and that terrifies me",1,"all my friends going to another ones birthday party,  my place in friendships as excess, the one who is forgetten or dismissed"
"So, here is my deal. Im successful. I am in great shape. I have a good life.

However, i have 0 self worth. 0 Self esteem. The worst. It's been this way for years.

**Backstory**
Severely abused as kid.  Then when i got out, I would over react to situations like a psycho. Extreme over the top protective responses to minor things.  I never hurt anyone, hit anyone, but was a hot emotional mess with how i handled things.  Learned to manage that with years of therapy.

Additionally, I would often find myself in relationships with women, who were horribly abusive and did some pretty shit things, further hurting my self esteem that i would allow my self to be treated like that.


So, i guess i feel since that I have allowed people to treat me as if i had 0 self worth for so long, that i feel like new great people wont possibly feel different. 

Additionally, I have alot of anxiety that alot of people may think I am crazy/emotionally unstable if tot hear of some of my situations in the past and i have stopped interacting with new people simply out of this fear.


i guess my difficulty, is that if i was overweight, I would feel like atleast i could put a plan into place where i could logically lose the weight and help me feel better.

however, i have maxed out everything that i can improve that way(body, finances).  I have to change the way my mind works and honestly, it seems impossible.

any thoughts/help/advice?",1,"Severely abused as a kid, in realtionship with women who were exteremely abusive, allowed people to treat me as if I had 0 self worth."

"It's such bullshit. Genetics is just this massive lottery and some people get lucky and some people don't. Naturally attractive people didn't do anything to get like that, they just happen to have good genetics. Meanwhile I'm an ugly piece of shit and did nothing to deserve it, but I'm stuck in this body until I die and I'll never get another chance. It's all I think about when I see attractive people anymore, I just get jealous and wonder why the world is so fucking unfair.",1,world is so fucking unfair
"For a little while there, things were looking up. I was talking to lots of people at work and in my classes, I was (kind of) making friends. Nothing serious, but it was 10x better than where I was before. I thought that I was finally getting out of this seemingly endless depression that I was in (I've been dealing with it for years now). For the first time in a very long time I felt like I was getting better.

Ha. Right.

Here I am on New Year's, sitting in my room crying and feeling sorry for myself. Probably going to get drunk in a second. Nobody invited me to do anything or even included me in their mass-texted happy new years wishes. There was one person who I thought I was really hitting it off with who I was going to chill with for new years, but he's suddenly not really talking to me and ditched me tonight (*he* suggested hanging out) to go out and do something else (which he also didn't invite me to). I'm not mad at anybody for not inviting me, don't get me wrong I know I'm not entitled to an invite to anything. But shit...why am I even fucking trying? Apparently I'm not worth being friends with. I'm just the last resort when you're so bored at work or school that you'll talk to whoever's around. 

And it's not even like ""oh don't take it personally, everyone has 'work friends' separate from people they actually hang out with all he time."" But even that's not true. Everyone at my job is super close and they hang out all the time in big groups. I was the only one in my tiny department (besides the guys who work in the back and don't really interact with those of us up front) not to get invited to a coworker's wedding.

Sometimes I honestly wonder if I'll ever have friends again. Honestly. That sounds so melodramatic but I can never get past ""acquaintance."" I can't even get people to add me on fucking Facebook. Why bother",1,"feeling sorry for myself, nobody invited me or even included me in their mass-texted happy new year wishes,  only one not to get invited in wedding"
Can I trade bodies with a straight white boy. Nobody is into me because I'm black. I'm drunk and done with existing. Maybe I'll just black out and die. That's the dream.,1,"trade bodies with straight white boy, nobody is into me because black"
"Hello, I'm a 17 yo female high school senior.
So I have many problems, and I'm not going to point each of them out for the sake of keeping this post as short as possible.
I suffer from depression and loneliness and it's getting worse day by day.

Ever since I was in Kindergarten, I was always the odd one out. Honestly though, I don't think I'm at fault here.
Fast forward to middle school and high school, I was/am still alone all the time. Literally.

I'm always alone during recess and I haven't smiled genuinely in 2 years now. I do get happy sometimes but never smiled genuinely.
All the friendships I had just crashed and burned because me and the other person(s) never interacted much in real life or not interacted enough. 

Most of my ""strong"" friendships have been through messaging rather than real life reactions. I have never been in trouble or on an adventure with anyone when those stuff are exactly what makes the base of a real and strong friendship.

Not to mention that I have been made fun of a lot for my taste of music or the way I dress or why I never diet to lose a couple of pounds (seriously, I am fat but not obese.)

And because I went through a lot of difficulties during childhood and early adolescence and I had no one to advice me or be there for me, I've gotten really self conscious and insecure about almost everything. And I'll be honest here, I hate myself so much because of it and I have tried to commit suicide multiple times before.

Getting bullied, being underestimated and looked down upon by your classmates and teachers and also being left alone all the time does make one think ""why? Why am I the only one alone and why am I soooo hated and unwelcome everywhere? Am I such a bad person?"" And all those endless questions and the dark abyss of depression.

I have a strict dad who doesn't let me do most things others my age do and a mom who doesn't want me to defy my dad. Also, financially speaking, I don't come from a rich family like my classmates do but we have enough to live and afford a couple of luxuries.
I love my family so much but they have never understood my problems and struggles which is the main reason why I am the way I am right now. I'm pretty sure if we at least tried to understand each other, not just me but not one of my family members would suffer from a chronic depression and/or have thoughts of dying and committing suicide.
My family don't understand me, they love me but they don't understand me which is why I can't have a real deep conversation with any of them.

Recently, I have found quite a few good people as friends but because we all have our own priorities, we barely see each other and most of the time our interactions are through texts, and that way we won't have a strong and/or real friendship and I also think a lot about it because I honestly don't know what having friends is like... I don't want to be the only one who cares a lot about the others and would go to such extents for them but then after a while the whole friendship crashes and burns.
I want to tell them that I am here to stay but I also know that now is not the time because we have to have more real life interactions and know each other more.

Speaking of my other friendships... The friendships I considered to be real ended up with me being stabbed in the back and left alone with a broken heart.
And I found out that I had no real friends but everyone were just classmates when I considered them to be friends last year when I lost a very dear uncle whom I loved more than both my parents and considered myself to be his daughter, no one had my back then... No one told me to cheer up or at least kept me company until I was strong enough to overcome it.

Right now I am very exhausted of everything... I just want to relax a bit feeling respected and loved a little without worrying about who I am.

I just want to stop hating myself and start loving myself, build up my self esteem.

So tell me, great people of reddit, how do I stop hating myself, deal with loneliness and depression (preferably overcome both of them) and keep these new friendships I have made going without forcing any of those whom I deeply love and care about?

"I was sexually abused as a child, there I said it. I hate bringing it up, it's a mood killer and it's not hard to see why. The problem is, well, there are many problems. Let's just go through some of them: Extreme anxiety and depression, self doubt, little to no self confidence, the feeling that I am malingering when I am not (idk how to explain it), feeling constantly alone, forcing myself into positions where I am alone. You get the idea.

I also have terrible coping mechanisms, I mostly play video games to pass the time, I am smart as my mother constantly reminds me, but all I see are my failures. I only find happiness from other people, I am always angry and sad, and this paragraph is a mess and now I'm crying.

"When I was around 10 my mom was babysitting kids and we went outside to play. When we were playing we ended up using the hose and for some odd reason I told my friend to hold the hose so it wouldn't squirt water and I put my face over it and he let go and i angrily threw a plastic play toy at him ( a light toy ). My mom became instantly angry. She started saying come here in a angry voice and I ran across the yard. Surprisingly she didn't come get me. Long story short I ran in the house went under the couch and hid. My mom rang the phone to my dad and he answered my mom whose was screaming because she couldn't find me. She found me and grabbed me and I kept yelling ""god please help."" And she put her knees on my arm and grabbed a pillow and put it over my face. But then she let go and told me to go down stairs. She told me how much I was a mistake and how she hated me and doesn't love me.

I still remember that day like it was yesterday. I tried killing myself 3times this month because I think about it everyday. I don't know what to do because it emotionally scared me. Can some one please help me.",1," playing outside with friends, threw a play toy at him, mom became instantly angery, hid under couch, mom found me ,grabbed me, I kept yelling ""god please help"", she put her knee on my arm , grabbed a pillow and put over my face, but let go, she said I was a mistake"
"I suspect that what I'm dealing with is a mixture of anxiety and depression, but I haven't been to talk to anyone yet. I'm a college student and plan to see one of the psychologists on-campus after they reopen for spring semester. Anyway, I've been dealing with a lot of issues of feeling alone, sad, and generally hating myself. Not all the time...but enough for it to be an issue. I only talk to my boyfriend because he's the only one I trust. I have one friend but we aren't close enough to discuss ""real"" issues. My anxiety stems from having a chronic illness and being sexually abused in a past relationship, on top of a lot of general social anxiety. A lot of my ""depression"" (I say that in quotes because I'm not sure if that's what it is yet) is self-defeating. I frequently find my mind telling me that I'm worthless, even though I logically know it isn't true. There have even been times when I'm home alone and force myself to go somewhere because 1)I'm too miserable in my own head and 2)I'm afraid I'll succomb to hurting (NOT killing) myself if I'm alone with my own thoughts. I've just been struggling a lot lately and wondered if anyone has similar experiences and has gotten through it. I am going to see someone, and I'm contemplating Zoloft. Not as a real fix, but just something to help me dig out of this hole I'm in right now. Sorry this was so long, just a lot of thoughts to shuffle through!
