"I can't write about my depression because it is so much a part of me that it can't be explained. Or at least that's what it feels like.

For starters, I haven't been diagnosed and I'm only 15. 

I have been living in this washed up state of grey for a few years now. I have sucessfully managed to push away all of my ""friends"", I have created this paralyzing reputation for myself as sad and apathetic and stupid and not hardworking and selfish. I haven't felt a positive emotion in so long and when I do it will go away within an hour. 

I cried for 45 minutes during class today and nobody even noticed and if they did they didn't find it strange or worrisome. It hurts inside to smile and I could never pretend to be happy because it would kill me. 

I am so stuck in all of this mental illness (that possibly could not even be real because I haven't been diagnosed or seen a doctor) 

I don't know why I'm writing or posting this, sorry.

The last seven years have been rough.

I've been in and out of depression most of my life, without realizing it because I thought that was what normal was. Seven years ago (seven?!?!) I realized that I wasn't mentally healthy. At the same time I was going through other stuff, was self medicating with weed, and had no direction in life. I had a massive breakdown/depression. Barely got out of bed, wasn't going to classes, couldn't even hold a conversation. I sort of pulled out of it but not much has gotten better.

Ever since then, i've been fighting the good fight but with little to no results. I've basically lost all of my friends or don't talk to them much. Even when I do i can't get past the fact that i went/still am crazy and can't just relax around them. Pretty much the same with family. They're more or less supportive but holidays and get togethers are fucking painful. I usually try to drink myself into being social with varying effects. 

I forced my way to getting a degree, even in that depressed state, because I didn't know what else to do. No idea how I can use that degree. I'm working a shitty job at a bank now and seem on the verge of being fired. I don't have the energy to grin and bear it. Depression is not great for customer service. I don't want to work at a bank. But i don't know what else I can or want to do. 

I'm so fucking lonely. I have no idea what to do with my life. Every day is a seesaw between extreme lows of depression and extreme highs of serious anxiety. 

I was against antidepressants but at this point it feels like I need to try something drastic. I tried Lexapro a while back for a few months and didn't notice anything change.

Anyone have any thoughts? all this time and it still feels like I'm at square one. Would really appreciate anything helpful.

"Two years and some change ago, I left the Marines to attend college and move my life forward. Even before separating, I had severe depression and anxiety issues that helped me make the decision to leave. Soon after I separated and began my coursework, my depression exploded to the point where I couldn't do anything and my anxiety to the point where I was terrified of leaving the house. I want from straight As in one semester to Cs the next because I could never make myself go to class, either because ""it wasn't worth it, I'm going to fail anyway because I'm awful"" or because I was terrified of being around people.

I tried therapy. First, I want to a private practice where I was told that nothing is wrong, everyone who leaves the service faces this and gets over it eventually. She had no answer when I brought up the 22 movement, which infuriated me even more and showed me that I wasn't going to get help there.

Next I tried the VA, which only made it worse. After trying to get me to wait for months (it took the therapist (or what I thought was a therapist at the time) calling to get me in her currently empty schedule), I go through months of weekly visits that go along these lines: I walk in, she asks how my week was, I answer and give her my journals she has me write, she asks for any clarifications needed (what does this word mean? who is this?) and then sends me home to write for another week. Nothing changed, nothing helped, she was basically just a living journal I recited my life to. Once I found out that she wasn't actually a therapist but a temp holding the position until they got an actual therapist (she admitted she didn't actually have the ability within the VA to do more than prescribe me low-level medications, which incidentally didn't include anti-depressants), I stopped going. She had noted that she believed I had PTSD but due to her temp position could not diagnose me as such within the VA.

So I tried for a few months to handle things myself and spiraled downward even more. Moving towards divorce with my wife (I wanted it because I finally realized she is a large part of my depression), I tried the VA again now that they had an actual therapist in office. Got checked in to the psychiatric system (didn't happen last time), so got a whole therapist/nurse practitioner/psychiatrist team to help me. Went great until I left to visit family for a month, things got worse with my wife and I isolated myself in my house again. Where they had me once diagnosed with PTSD, and thus my care and medication was free, I was sent a letter informing me I owed the VA for all my medication since I was no longer service-connected (they went back and now denied that my service had anything to do with my mental state).

Adding to that, I panicked and dropped out of my courses for a semester and now owe $3000 to my university, effectively ending my courses and thus my GI bill benefits, which I was using for housing. With no money, I now had to get a job. That was August.

Since then, I've applied everywhere from McDonalds to senior IT positions as long as I met the qualifications. No part time work has come through (only response has been Best Buy that told me four months later I was not getting the job), entry-level IT positions are worried that I am over-qualified and will leave when another company offers me a better position (every HR that has given me a reason for not hiring me has cited this) and higher positions won't hire me because I don't have my degree, even when it is listed as preferred in the job description.

The worst part was the holidays. Stuck alone with my soon to be ex wife and listening to what few friends I have left tell me how great their christmas was. I'm not about to have them stop, even though it just rubs in that I sat home alone over the holidays, because over the past year I've lost almost everyone I'd considered a close friend and I'm terrified of losing the two I have left.

I have no idea what to do. Two months and I'll be homeless. And that kills me because I have a dog that I don't think I can live without (the only creature left that I feel truly gives a damn about me) but I'm not willing to take her to the streets with me. No job, wife's job isn't enough to pay for everything... I'm at a loss and every day something new gets dumped on me.",5,"severe depression and anxiety, tried therapy, nothing changed, once I found out she wasnt not a therapist but a temp"

"I've just really been struggling the past few years in my home town where I still live. I'm lucky to be able to still live at home with my mom and brother who care about me while I work full time and have pretty cheap rent living at home while I pay debts off. But other than that, I don't have much else here. I have no friends and a lot of people who know me or of me really don't like me, which is a mixture of things I've done to push people away but also things that I have no control over. I do have a good career path I'm happy to be in, merchandising for one of the 3 major pop companies and the opportunity to move up and even transfer. Since I don't really have anything where I'm at right now other than my job which I can transfer with, should I just bite the bullet and move away when I can afford it after my debts are paid? I'm just really scared that things won't be much better for me especially since I'm pretty Introverted and don't do things like go out to bars like most people do my age(22) since that's just not the scene I'd like to socialize in. Talking with my mom about this, she just makes is seem like it won't get better anywhere else and I just hate hearing that answer since it makes life seem like it'll always be bleak like mine is now.

"They're basically all friendly towards me until I talk about my feelings and depression and then they're like ""Oh you're depressed? Bye"" 

it's not even that people just don't want to deal with me, whether its my close friends that I used to open up too. (Found out quickly that they weren't close to me at all because they all left me) The worst part is is that when girls talk about their depression or their anxiety people are like ""Awww do you want someone to talk to, are you okay?""

 But when guys talk about feelings our depression I just can't because I know all they would do is just pay no attention. It's so dumb.

Am I the only one that thinks like this? Because I've never seen any guy open up about their ""depression"" if they had one they usually keep it to themselves. Even after if they've gone through break ups they never really say anything about being depressed but it's ""okay"" if girls are depressed.

"People I encounter, family, co-workers, employers, peers, use this demented perversion of Darwinism to suggest that I am unfit; that I have to be the one to adapt and adapt while the world remains static. They say, âItâs adapt for dieâ, and if I canât adapt then I donât deserve to be successful. Many people act as though because I am different that the onus falls entirely upon me to change myself. If I am a round peg and the only opening is a square hole, then I am expected to what, use brute force to fit in? Thereâs no concern for personal tolls it takes to force myself into a place I donât fit into, and if I canât handle the pressure, the personal damage incurred by that process, then I get labeled defective, mentally unfit. My father tells me to follow the Marine Corps motto of, âadapt, improvise, overcomeâ, but life is not a military operation.

Instead of people trying to meet me half way, instead of people seeing the value in diversity of thought and trying to accommodate me even in the slightest, I am condemned for not being endlessly adaptable. I am not some âUbermenchâ, capable of endless internal rearrangement, I am a human person! Of course I can change, I can adapt, but I canât be someone entirely different; Iâm not clay you can just reshape over and over again! 

I suppose itâs easy to level such criticisms when you are arenât different, when youâre not the one being told to give up what makes you who you are; when youâre a square peg trying to fit into a square hole. People who donât have these difficulties say to me, âwhy canât you just be like me? If I could be successful, anyone could, so if you canât itâs because your just being obstinate and unreasonable; itâs your fault and you need to changeâ. Others take a more defeatist, pragmatic view and say, âthe world wonât change, so you need to. If you try to be different youâll just be tilting at windmills. Thatâs just the way it is, so just conform to whatâs expected of you and be pretend to be happy about it.â 

It makes me bitter, and people see that bitterness as unjustified and roll their eyes at it, only serving to intensify my bitter feelings. Why wouldnât I feel bitter? I struggle and struggle, only to have others devalue my experiences and scoff at my pain; to label me with all sorts of offensive stereotypes and make no effort to understand my position. People say, âdonât be bitter, itâs not attractiveâ, but what else am I supposed to feel? Iâm sorry the way I feel isnât attractive, but itâs the way I feel and no amount of scorn and disapproval is going to change that. Wouldnât you feel bitter in my shoes? Fighting an uphill battle to just be yourself, without support, without validation of any sort, while no one seems to take you seriously? Am I supposed to just lie and counterfeit myself my entire life? What sort of life is that? Itâs one thing to struggle for find you path in life, itâs another to have those who already have spit on me the whole way.  

My therapist once told me to pretend to fit in, to just fake it until I feel it, but I never felt it; I just feel more and more empty and dead inside. I feel progressively hollow, depleted, eroded away. I fear that one day there will be nothing left of me, that eventually Iâll be nothing more than a zombie, shuffling from place to place without thought, without feeling.

Iâm sorry Iâm different, Iâm sorry I canât just be like everyone else and feel good about it. Iâm sorry about it every single day; I am made to feel sorry about it every single day. If I could I would be someone else, but I canât. I only hope one day someone will value me for who I am, instead of who they want me to be.

"Is... Is this really a thing? Another post recently had a reply pointing this out as a possibility of being a thing.

 My life isn't bad. It's not great, I'm not homeless and I have food and a roof... But I just feel like everything is wrong so often. If left to my own thoughts I sit and dwell on all I;m done wrong, how I may have upset people that day, do people actually care? Am I being manipulated for their gain and it's all fake 'love' towards me? 

I don't know what's wrong. I sit and cry for no reason just because nothing feels correct or right, but I don't know what's wrong about it. I'm afraid of upsetting people so I always shrink back at conflict. I'm afraid of seeming too needy so I never tell people when something is wrong. 


I have someone I care about, but I'm so afraid of burdening them with more problems about myself, when they have their own stuff to deal with anyway. It's not a... 'relationship' in the common use of the word, but someone that is important to me, so I don't feel I have the right to pester them or drag them down. And what would I tell them anyway? ""I'm uspet because nothing is right, but I don't know what right is, so I don't even know it's wrong anyway?"" That doesn't work... 


I'm not suicidal. I have no right to be. I don't think I have half the problems those that stand on that cliff must have in their life, so how could I possibly consider doing that? I just want to sleep so much. When I'm asleep I don't think, I don't dwell on how I feel. 


It's so dumb. I worry over even stupid stuff in video games with friends. I switched servers in a game recently, and I still contact and talk to all the people from the old server, but I still felt sick as I did it. I sat and cried over slighting those that I left behind on the old server, because I left them behind. 


Is this dumb shit I sit and think and do Depression? These thoughts of being worth nothing, thoughts that I'm hurting everyone around me by existing, forcing them to interact with me like I'm the unwanted little brother of your best friend that his mom forced him to bring along to play with. 


But now I have to wonder if I just manufacture all this myself. Make myself feel negative about myself to get... whatever I get out of that. Loop it around, driving myself more and more downward.


I dunno why I posted this really. Maybe I just want people to at least see that I'm not all there. I tried so hard to hide that from those I care about, that maybe nobody knew something was wrong for the longest time. So... Thanks for reading this.",5,"sit and cry for no reason, nothing feels correct, afraid of upsetting people, "
"When I look at everyone around me, they all seem happy and motivated to live out their lives at least to some degree. They look like they have passions, and interests and things to live for. 

I can't seem to find any of these things for myself anymore. Everything feels so mundane. Pointless. I work and work and work and then I get this tax return that's lessens as I work harder. And for what? To build this life over my span of consciousness just to have it all disappear and mean nothing when I die? 

Life is painful. I feel like I have to fake emotions and reactions to things just to get through the day looking ""normal"" to everyone around me. This inescapable feeling of hopelessness just won't go away. No matter what I do. I try and change something and it still hangs over me. 

I feel like no one will understand the way I feel. I can't even fully understand it, let alone put it into words. I can't even bring myself to end it all because I think of how much it would hurt the only family I still have left. Everytime I've come close to ending my life, my mind floods with images of my sister finding my body and just breaking down.

"THIS IS A FOLLOW UP TO MY PREVIOUS POST.

Start of 6th grade,my classroom was empty and as a class,we were assigned to decorate the classroom.

After years of miserable group work,I realised that no one accepts my opinions,this time was stupid as I am one of the best students at art,and NO ONE asked my for help,they kept calling me irrelavant and useless.So I decided to sweep the classroom,as Singaporeans,we never-EVER,clean up after one another,So the class looked like the aftermath of a party,From then,I started sweeping for hours,instead of appreciating me efforts to help,many just laughed at me for being that ""Cleaner boy"" and others made facial expressions that looked like I was bothering them,whenever I went to their side to clean up.

After that,I went for a rest,at my seat,which a group of people are working on stuff on,when I jokingly said a joke (Obviously),they just shooed me off and called me ""The useless one"",seriously,did no one realise how clean the room was after I swept?

Now the most horrible part:Some time later,get this,MY TEACHER COMPLAINED ABOUT HOW THE CLASSROOM WAS DIRTY!At this point I was all ready to commit murder already,fucking trashwhore,If i didn't make an effort to clean up the class,I tell you,bitch,your classroom will look like a fucking garbage disposal.

LITTLE THINGS THAT RUIN MY DAY:

I went up to a group of kids,and kindly asked if they got any trash for me,one of them said: ""YOU!"" I laughed it off,but deep down I was heartbroken.After the teacher complained,I was pissed,some one asked me for help,and I said no,he said: ""Why did you not help us the whole time?"" I swear,if I was in the US with that fuckboi,I will shoot off his limbs and pour salt on the wounds.

YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THIS PART IF YOU READ MY PREVIOUS POST.

"I met Annie in 5th grade (I am in 6th grade now),In 5th grade,there was this camp where we are supposed to go to,we were supposed to make new friends and know each other better,fuck all,that shit was completely neglected throughout the whole time,The camp was where I first started to like Annie.

How we first talked was fucking stupid.on the first day (Night),we were supposed to prepare for a dance,there was this open area where we would practice,that time,I was bored af,I had no intrest in dancing,being the fuckface introvert I am,I looked around,and saw this screen-door thing,which led to what looked like complete darkness,I mumbled ""Hmm,what's in there"",Then out of nowhere,Annie said ""I don't know,you go in first and tell me""
At this point,I could take the oppurtuinity to introduce myself,try to start a conversation,or get to know her better,but instead,I said ""Nah,ladies first!"" Till this day I still question my past.By the way,Annie was awkward and witty,exactly the same shit as I was,so at that point,I started taking intrest in her.

Next semester,3 months later,Annie and I got into the same group,I wanted to know more about her,so we talked a bit,and my god,she was the girl of my dreams,Other than being witty and awkward,I then knew that she was the cutest little thing ever,and her voice,jesus it makes me jizz myself every time (Joke!).From that point on,we were really good friends,we were talking about random shit every minute of class,and had a wonderful time,her existence made a shield around me,all negative thinking,depression,existential thoughts,would be repelled from that ""Shield around me"",I was looking forward to school every night,and I constantly felt in love even though I have no idea what she thought of me.She was so awesome that even if she friendzoned me for life,I would still remain cheerful.

We had too much fun,our teacher fucking seperrated us,immediately,I went from ecstatic to suicidal,I cried myself to sleep almost every day,fantacising of us together again.

After the suicidal thoughts,I was always sad,negativity could easily penetrate me without that ""shield"",She would sometimes react to my jokes,but that's it,I never dared to speak to her since then,I hate social anxiety.

"I'm gonna write an essay venting here so incoming wall of text.

I see a lot of posts on here which revolve around unemployment, lack of academic achievement, ""failure"" in one aspect or another, and I can relate to those things, but I'm on the other side and I feel worse now more than ever.

I've always had depression come and go, and maybe that's generally normal, but I did relatively well for myself anyways. I had fun in college, met some really cool people, was in a frat and a few other organizations, generally had a good time. I don't think I've ever had a close friend but that never really bothered me, I am super introverted by nature and can easily spend a month without human contact and be just fine. I graduated with a good major and good grades, I got a good job right out of college at an employer that hires 1% of applicants, 3 months later I quit because I got an offer from another employer that hires even more selectively, I moved to a cool city on the west coast. I don't have any large insecurities, I feel that I'm relatively smarter than most people, a good employee and a person worth hiring at any job in my field. I do fine with women generally, never had a serious girlfriend because I always lose interest in people and I prefer being alone when I'm not working because I find people to be exhausting.

I have a cool apartment in the downtown area, I have a ""great job"" which people are jealous of, old friends hit me up asking for interview advice and references. I'm 23 and on my way to making 6 figures relatively soon.

I did everything right, my parents are proud of me, everyone treats me well, and even more so when they know you're successful and have money, but that can be an entirely different post. All this doesn't even matter because I'm more depressed today than I ever have been.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I have no true for ambition for corporate life, I find everything to be pointless and stupid, I'm really fucking good at pretending to be ambitious, and telling people what they want to here which is why interviewing has always been easy for me. But at my core, I don't give a fuck about anything, I feel like a zombie working from 9-7 every weekday to finally reach the weekend, have it fly by and then rinse and repeat. I really just want to do NOTHING, maybe read something I enjoy, play some video games, or find a new hobby or whatever but working makes me want to kill myself more and more everyday. 

Does that make me lazy as fuck? Probably, I don't know, that's what I get told whenever I express discontent with the work life. I don't care about material things beyond a few necessities and some hobbies. If I had enough money to pay my rent and a little extra for the rest of my life I would quit immediately.

My only goal in life is to have enough money so I don't need to have anymore goals. Goals are bullshit, ""oh if I work really hard I can be the financial MANAGER in a few years and make more money, then I can get a cooler apartment or a nice house and continue slaving away until I'm an old man die."" It's all just bullshit, who gives a fuck. Why would I want a job with more responsibilities which gives me more money I don't use, it all feels like a giant joke.

The only hope that keeps me going is somehow finding a way out and having enough money/passive income to retire, but the thought that it may take 15 years or more makes it seem useless. I feel like my youth is slipping away, I'm tired everyday, I have trouble sleeping, even my hair is starting to fall out which is fucking depressing.

I have a few thousand in savings after sending money home to support my parents, with barely any free time or energy to find something I can invest in. I'm stuck working and watching time fly by week after week. It feels like a hopeless cycle with no escape, like no matter what I do I'm destined to working some zombie office job until I'm an old man until I can finally retire and die. I want to throw all my money in a business idea or something but with my current energy and time and mental state, I would probably fail miserably and lose all my money and go back to square one.

Everything is depressing, I just want to disappear.

Does the mind rule the body or does the body rule the mind ?..

.I'm in a really strange place right now. I know I have depression (at least I believe I do with my family history). But I usually find myself getting depressed about things I see in the world. 

For example just seeing how much sex is exploited. Just seeing the thumbnails of YouTube videos of women showing off their breasts and how these videos have millions of views. It just bums me out.

Seeing hate and violence on tv. It really just gets to me. I start getting really upset when I see how shallow/ easily tempted/ lead people are. 

Is this normal? Is it the world doing this to me, or is it my mind? 

I've basically lost everything these past few weeks..my belief in a god, my friends, my hopes. I now have only one real person I can talk to. I want out. And I've had enough, where is there for a person like me in the world to live ?

Please anyone, comment your thoughts on this. What gets you depressed ? Is it common what I feel?",5,"does mind rule body or body rule the mind,at  strange place, family history of depression, I see how sex is exploited, seeing hate and violence on tv gets me "
"   Hi reddit, I would like to tell you a little bit about myself, and hopefully meet a great community to help me on my journey. I a'm a very quiet person, don't get much attention, and I spend all my time at home or at school.I'm 17 years old and tonight is my last day of Christmas break, and my last day of childhood since tomorrow is my 18th birthday (technically today since my birthday January 4th and it's already 1:50AM).I have spent my night drinking, smoking, and crying. The only thing I've been able to think about tonight is how dull and boring my 18 years have been leading up to this point. I haven't accomplished very much at all in 18 years and everyday i feel worse about it. Well I've made a firm decision to change my life tonight.
Tomorrow morning is my first day back at school, and my first day as an adult,after two long and lonely weeks of Christmas break. I've been ignoring my depression for a long time now, and I'm just now starting to acknowledge the reality of it. I'm already trying to get myself on the right path and basically this post is some sort of icebreaker to try and get involved in the community and to get some tips on staying positive, and some positive and insightful perspective on my life. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this. I will be replying to comments tomorrow after school, good night to everyone and I hope you all have as great of a day as I will tomorrow.

" I walked in on my first day of high school a depressed kid. i made some friends, they showed me that life is more than just moping around and working to get a diploma to mope and work more. They are the best people Ive met in my life so far and i would protect them with my life. i care for them a lot and would do anything for them.

That was 3 years ago, and of course, im still a depressed kid with friends. However, i think about killing myself on a weekly basis, and openly say that i hate myself to a lot of people. it has become common practice to say these things, like a shield to desensitize me and other people from mortality and the worse of the world. I also secretly hope that this softens the blow if i ever decide to jump off that overpass in my area. 

I want my friends, family, and everyone im connected with to remain happy and normal, so i put on that fake smile and pretend that nothing is wrong aside from the therapy that doesnt work. i value other people's happiness more than mine (for reasons that would make this post too long) so i keep on smiling and repress emotions until i walk into my room and shut the door. everyone i am connected with doesnt know im suicidal, i dont want them to worry about me, just to remain happy. and if i kill myself they would worry and get sad too, like me right now. i am living for other people because i dont want them to know the truth. i am a prisoner of other people. 

i just want to know what the hell am i supposed to do, and that im not alone in this world

tl,dr: i made friends in high school and started to care about people in my life. but im depressed and dont want anyone to know that im mentally ill and suicidal because i want them to stay happy and not worry about me. so i live with a false smile on my face, and keep my emotions to myself. what the heck am i supposed to do?",5,"walked first day of school as depressed kid, made some grate friends, want to kill self but concerend about friends, family and everyone in contact, keep smiling and repress emotions"
"I wish it would go away.  My brain struggles to handle the fact that nothing matters and becomes disgusted with things like religion that give hope.  Everything is so seemingly random and purposeless.  Whenever I think about my life, I always feel so out of control.  I had no choice in my existence.  Everyday life without my distractions of fantasy..through games and TV shows..is meaningless and awful, yet I must participate to keep consuming the media that I truly live for.  I work and get education in an exhausting cycle every day..for an uncertain future in a VERY  fucked up and disgusting world in light of recent events.  How do I cope with the feelings of dread that wash over me?  I guess I'll try to answer for myself.  I just keep distracting, keep consuming media that gives my life interest and purpose.  Yet, as of late even that hasn't been enough.  I need the bigger distraction of other people I guess.  I want to socialize and build relationships to strengthen my life's meaning, but this is really, REALLY fucking hard.  Reaching out to people in today's American society is like jumping off a bridge in which you'll land on your feet or face first.  As an American, superficial and acquaintance relationships dominate.  The real struggle is to create something more.  I'm really afraid that my exhaustion will soon outweigh my desire to consume more media and the relationships I have by the time I have my BA degree.  I can just end the suffering, the pain, the world, MY world, at any time.

"Im sitting in my bathroom 1/5th deep with a belt wrapped around my neck just trying to get something out. I am generally a relatively passive depressed person. I feel like I am hyper-aware of my situation but I don't feel emotion like I should although I feel it welling up in me. 

Why can't I cry? I feel like if I could ball my eyes out I would be fine after but I just can't do it. I am usually content with my emotions but probably once a week I get this feeling that I need to coax them out to get some sort of release. It's like there is this immense pressure inside me and all I need to do is turn a valve but I can't find the right one.

I want to die. I am very close with my family which stops me, but only because I can't stand the idea of putting them through that. I understand that I am lucky to have people who love me so much but more often than not it feels more like a burden than a blessing. 

Im not super emotional that I want to die, rather i'm pretty passive about it. In my mind this seems a completely logical solution to my problems. I still love my ex girlfriend, I have self-esteem issues etc but at this point none of that really seems a factor to me. I have felt this way for a long time, much longer than my present problems are responsible for.

I have friends who are enlightened as to my situation and they try to help but everything they say goes in one ear and out the other. I don't think I'm actually going to do it tonight. My mother always jokingly said that you should always keep your house clean in case you died tomorrow. I feel that way now. There are loose ends to be tied up before I did anything definite.

It would be so much easier. It frustrates me, no it pisses me off sometimes that suicide is considered such a selfish thing. What about me? What about what I feel? Is a life lived for other's comfort really worth living?

I guess what scares me at this point is that the idea of suicide doesn't scare me anymore. I have my ideas about what might come after and I think it's eternal peace. Afterlife or not (veering towards not) I have the opportunity of eternal rest in front of me so why not?

I don't know why I am posting this. Maybe I just want to air my grievances before I leave this place.",5,"generally depressed perosn, hyper-aware of my situation, immense pressure inside me, I need to turn valve but cant find a rigth one, super emotional, still love ex girlfriend"
"For a long time I feel like I am just going through the motions. Feel empty, last funeral (late 2016) I went to a very close family friend who treated me like a grandson but I felt nothing. I just felt nothing, like I was waiting for it to end. For last 3-4 years it has been hard for me to feel anything. 
I haven't been feeling suicidal at all but I wish I could feel. I haven't been happy for awhile, just want to lie in bed all day. I don't even know what to do anymore. I feel like a hamster in a wheel, just moving in place. I have always been the odd one in the family, I try to put on a smile. I smile on the outside but inside is nothing. 
The family disappointment, the one who everyone sees as the family loser. Its like I try to feel something. I try to make myself angry so I can feel something, anything so I feel alive. ",5,"feel like going through motions, feel nothing, like hamster in a wheel, family disappointment"
"My depression has taken everything. I'm nearly 30 and been suffering with depression for 10 years. 

It just gets worse. I lost my girlfriend. I can't work. I can't  be around for my family. I had to move in with with my Mum in a tiny box room that I can't be bothered to keep clean.

I've been in bed for two days, I haven't even showered. I barely eat.

I'm on my second medication and this one has no effect either. I'm on the waiting list for therapy but it will be months before I can speak to someone.

I my life is just getting wasted and there's no sign things will get better.

No question to ask of Reddit, just sharing my experience.

Happy 2017

"Not sure how to start this. So ill start by telling a few things about my life.

I am a 23 years old male, living in brazil, currently working with IT. 

My parents and my girlfriend are really supportive and i don't really have big problems in my life, which leads to the big issue: i feel like complete shit.

Despite having a job, a car, a girlfriend, a place with people that i know that love me that i can call home, i still feel like complete shit and knowing these things and not understanding why i feel like this makes me feel even worse.

I have tried suicide in the past and these thoughts are behind me, but the feeling of being worthless and that im not accomplishing anything haunt me everyday. 

I would appreciate some help on this.

Thank you and Sorry for the rant.",5,"parents and girlfriend really supportive,, dont understand why I feel like this makes me feel even worse"
