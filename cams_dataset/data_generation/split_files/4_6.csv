"Hey guys, for the past year or so I have been depressed. My girlfriend of 3 years just left me, After I found out she has slept with 7+ different guys. I just don't feel like I'm deserving of love, I can't sleep I can't eat. I don't know I just wanted to put this out there. It feels like there's a weight on my chest all the time and anytime I think about being happy my mind shuts it down. Thanks for listening.",4,"girlfriend of 3 years just left me, After I found out she has slept with 7+ different guys, deserving of love, there's a weight on my chest"
"I was with a bunch of friends on new years and i wasnât looking forward to the rest of the party, let alone the coming of a whole new year filled with depression, anxiety, all the things that come with it etc. i started to get into my depressed mood at around 10pm on NYE but i decided i was gonna try to go into 2018 with no regrets. 

As a little backstory in a junior in high school, it may sound a little silly but iâve been in love with this girl (who also is my best friend, been indirectly friendzoned more times than iâd like to admit) since about freshman year. i finally built up the courage to tell her that i have feelings for her. 

She told me that the feeling was mutual and it just made my entire night. iâve had a smile on my face for 24 hours and iâm just so happy with life because of this. Just something i wanted to say because itâs all iâve been thinking about. 

Iâm not going to sit here and say that âeverything gets better in timeâ or anything like that for multiple reasons, but just know that something small can make your day :)",4," been in love with this girl who also is my best friend, been indirectly friendzoned"
"I am curious to know why someone would help me here, but let's go, I used to be a very happy and pleasant person, at some point I became a negative person and a little depressive, I believe that due to the death of my grandmother (she always took care of me and I only realized how important she was when I lost her), because of this I think I felt guilty and started to see things more negatively, after that everything started to get worse in my life, even When I feel I'm happy, it's for a brief moment. I do not know if it is part of growing up and getting older or if I have some kind of problem, so I wanted some help, even if it was words or situations where someone also lost an important person and somehow managed to continue to live",4,"death of my grandmother, guilty, negative person, worse in my life"
"Basically, I developed a really big crush on this girl. It was the only time I've ever seen my self being in a relationship. And get this! She had a crush on me too! I was so happy. I was going to ask her out last night at a NYE party, it's the only reason I went. But I missed my chance. Whatever, I'm hanging out with her and some other people tomorrow, I'll ask her then.

Never-fucking-mind.

I got a text from her a couple hours ago. She said she just wanted to be friends. I respected her, I didn't want to be a creep like a guy from r/incels. I told her I got it.

I didn't get it.

She liked me last night. I know she did. And today she didn't. I don't get now feelings for a person could come and go like that. The worst part? One text from a girl destroyed ever bit of progress I've made to better myself since November.

I've been feeling good, maybe happy since then. I've been doing good, been free of self harm. Until today. The only thing that could get my mind of her was pain.

I have to hang out with her and my friends tomorrow. They are probably going to see my fresh cuts.

I just want to be clear, I still want to be her friend. But I still have a crush on her, despite what she made me do. All my old coping mechanisms didn't work. I can't get her out of my head.

I can't stop thinking of it'd be different if I asked her out last night.",4,"One text from a girl destroyed, self harm ,can't stop thinking"
"Whatever you want to talk about Iâll talk about. Long lost love, struggles of everyday life, anything. Hereâs my story: I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for 15 years. I have cut out friends and some extended family because I donât want to be hurt anymore. I isolated myself so much I am ruining my life. I have wronged others, badly. I feel terrible about that. I have stopped talking to someone who was pretty much a soul mate/twin flame..if you believe in that.. no other words to explain it. (I hate the word soul mate)Currently in a slightly toxic relationship where I am not heard and not really given the opportunity to discuss things in detail. This is because they do not have the capacity to have a deep conversation, and also their phone takes precedence over living human beings. I also do not have a âbest friendâ and this bothers me to no end. 

Can you relate? Letâs hear your story.",4," toxic relationship, Long lost love, cut out friends, ruining my life"
"Iâve struggled with major depression since I was probably 14-15 and Iâm 25 now. Iâve tried several different medications and had many bad turn outs with that. I am on 200mg of Wellbutrin now and it seems to work well but every 6 months or so, I just get the fuck itâs and stop taking it. Like âi donât need this shitâ. And then of course Iâll get extremely down &amp; have many more suicidal ideations. I usually have them daily anyways. 

I realize I have to stop doing this, and I tell myself every single time that I wonât do it again, but I always do. Even though I am currently on an antidepressant it doesnât make the suicidal thoughts go away. I can be having an okay day and I will still picture myself with a gun in my mouth or similar things. 

I donât think Iâll ever actually do anything to end my life for a few simple reasons â my brother hung himself 4 years ago and I know how hard it was on me, my dad would be lost without me, and honestly because I have stuff in my room I wouldnât want my parents to have to see or find (stupid I know but whatever works right). 

Anyways, I feel like Iâm rambling but the point of my post is to see what other people do to stop these thoughts. Just looking for tips or ideas that I could try because it takes a toll on me after awhile and for fucks sake, id like to get through one whole day without thinking about offing myself. Iâve tried some coping mechanisms such as journaling but I couldnât ever stick with it. ",4,"brother hung himself, suicidal ideations, gun in my mouth"
"I'll just cut to the chase. I'm very depressed and not entirely sure why. I have a lot of stress and trauma so I think that contributes to it but I really can't point to one thing. I am only happy when I'm with a select two people. Neither of which I see often so I end up very depressed when I'm not with them. I'm good at masking it while I'm with people but as soon as I'm alone it hurts so much. I used to think that taking my life seemed completely abstract but now it just seems closer to reality. However, I know I would never because I have a lot to live for and a lot of people care about me. But I just need some way to get rid of the pain. I can't see a therapist reguarly due to complicated reasons. I was curious about anti depressants I don't know much about them but I just need some way to not be sad all the time.",4,"only happy when I'm with a select two people,Trauma, taking my life, rid of the pain"
"Hello everyone

as the title says I typed this for a friend, it explains in the text why. I have a history of depression and self harm (not suicidal, just really numb when depressed) which my friend doesn't know much about, but he knows me well so he will relate instantly. 
Trickier thing is that he is really far away (he moved to GB, I am in Germany. He is going through a rough patch himself, just before christmas he got rejected by the first woman he approached after his wife died early 2014. He is mentally stable though and I am sure he'd want to know this, I am just not sure how to tell him really. I can't word this in free speech, I am not a native speaker and I want this to be as clear as can be. I do fear the text might be too much and/or weird? I have no proper judgement anymore...

here the text, I'd appreciate any help. thank you

So, first of all, I donât expect anything from you, I just need to share with someone who I knows me well enough to understand and I need you, as a friend, to know about this in case it will get worse (no worries, this might sound overly dramatic, itâs not that big of a deal for me since I am used to it) 
A few months back I started feeling stressed and burned out without being able to put a finger on why that is since realistically I had less to do than like a year back. I explained it to myself with lack of interaction with others or dull tasks which have to be done over and over or just hormonal crap and took that for the reason why I felt mentally unstable.
I tried to work on it, made sure to get some breaks here and there, was drawing and painting and meeting with people but things didnât get better (which I only realized a few days back)
The first time I was alarmed was when the urge to just run away for a day or two. There I realized for the first time that my mind is not sending the right signals, since I love the boys and xxx and being away wouldnât be nice at all since Iâd miss the kids for sure.
Still thinking it was an overload of work I talked to xxx, telling him all this and asking him for help (like helping out around the house, that kind of help) which he tries to to his best efforts. 
Itâs still not getting better. I had a proper meltdown on my birthday and on second day of christmas, still not releasing fully whatâs going on. This night I couldnât sleep, I went to bed at 11:30, fell asleep close to 1 am and woke up around 2:15 (thank you fitness tracker for the accurate information) The baby woke me and I couldnât fall back asleep although I tried everything that would usually help. So I laid there thinking it all through and then all kinds of bad memories popped up. You know that I have the worst memory and that I am amazing with âforgettingâ things I donât want to remember, though they arenât gone for goodâ¦ 
Not sure why the normal version of me always decides not to find a way to truly process all the stuff so this shitty version of me wouldnât have so much to feed on but thatâs how it is now. I also realized that I have a general numbness when it comes to feeling emotions, I'm never very happy or enjoy things to the fullest, nor am I really sad nor angry or anything, everything is a little muted. That I actually hate and fear the most, becoming numb and empty.
So, this leaves me where I am now. Itâs not unbearable or anything, but I am afraid whereâll lead to eventually. I want to be a good mum and a full functioning personâ¦ 

I think I needed you to know, as I said, in case things go a lot south and Iâd need your support.

"It's been one hell of a time these past 5ish months and lately, my depression has been kicking my butt.

"I love rewatching the original trilogy and the sequel trilogy.  I love the speeches and quotes about hope, rebellion, and doing what right. I really love seeing more diversity in the cast of Star Wars, and love how the focus has shifted from magic space wizards to underdog rebels against evil empires

But it feels like the good guys in our world are losing.

Some of people in power of our government and other spheres of influence (like YouTube and the police system) are abusive and act in their own interests, forsaking the poor, the envoirnent, respect and culture, education.

It takes so much to do good yet it takes very little to do bad.  And there seems to be growing presence of âbadâ online and in real life.

Whatever ârebellionâ exists is just a bunch of people who are hurt, anger, scared, maybe even dying or having everything slowly taken away from them.  A homeless man or disabled person losing programs that can help them. An environment damaged beyond all repair.  A victim being blamed for an abusers action. Parents not accepting their children identity.  A brilliant student being deported to another country and having his dreams crushed for the rest of his life because his parents sent him to a safer country without documentation.  We lost to government that trying to brainwash us with âalternate factsâ and âfake newsâ while also normalizing fascism racism abuse and bigotry. We lost to the FFC.  Hell, I lost my best friend almost a year from today.

I donât talk about it with my friends or family - if you know me, then you would also know my family is dealing with their own toxic politics and  Bullshit...and my friends...are the only good people I have left and I donât want to lose them...  I keep retreating back to Star Wars. I need a han, a luke, a Finn, a Rey, a leia, a resistance or a rebellion....

But it just seems like the people who make up evil empire - the abusers, the gross disrespected, the hate mobs, the uncaring and arrogant politicians- have won on all fronts.

We have no rebellion.  No resistance.  They say not to give into hate - and that love will and has always saved us.  But one day, I may not have anything or anyone left to love and life for , not if I spend the rest of my life in a world run by these kinds of evil people.

"Apparently, people hate it when others talk about their suffering online. People figure if you're talking about how depressed you are on social media, you must be faking it or looking for attention. A sincere cry for help makes you an ""Attention Whore"" apparently. I hate it when people dismiss others' pain as insincere just because they posted about it on social media, and even going as far as to make jokes about it.
Also, I hate people dismissing others' pain because of their age. I saw a tweet once that was like, ""If you're under 23 and claiming to be depressed, you aren't really depressed. You don't know depression until you're an adult"" or something like that, and that certainly isn't true. I knew two people, one in middle school and one in high school, that were hospitalized for weeks from suicide attempts.

Please, don't assume others are making up their pain ""just for fun"" because more often than not, the person behind the screen is actually suffering.

"Recently I got together with my long time on and off close guy friend from high school. We hadn't talked in over half a year because I blocked him due to the fact that I felt he was constantly leading me on. A couple of months ago he found a way to reach out to me and I ended up calling him and we met up. I ended up kissing him, which is not my nature because I would like to wait till marriage to do anything sexual. Kissing is not too much of a big deal for me but it is something special. I began talking to him again and we would hang out and kiss. I had an emotional breakdown in front of him at one point and that is when I realized that I really liked him. I decided it was time for us to have a talk about where our relationship was going because I had many boundaries and he had many expectations that crossed those boundaries. I finally had a talk with him where he didn't take me very seriously and constantly made jokes about sex and how that's what he wanted from me, till I realized he wasn't merely joking, the things he said had a lot of truth to them. I felt very stupid for being so oblivious to the fact that this man that I have known since high school was such a dirt bag. I ended up leaving his car mid conversation because he wasn't taking me seriously and we haven't really talked since. The following day I felt so liberated. I never felt so happy in my entire life. I realized that I deserved much better but the issue is, I never seem to give that to myself. Despite feeling pretty great about my crappy fling ending, I feel like a part of me is upset. I always end up grieving over people who didn't really try with me and for some reason I don't care this time. For some reason, I want him to see what he missed out on. I know he and I are on different wavelengths, I understand that. I just feel like he lost someone who could've given him real love and care, someone who would've fed his mind. He and I clicked, we had nothing in common but we clicked. He has never been involved with a girl like me, someone willing to feed his soul instead of his body. Sometimes he would make fun of me, call me a ""12 year old girl"" because my idea of a relationship doesn't include sex. I feel like nobody will date me because of this matter, though I know I'm beautiful and hold many admirable characteristics. I feel like this is all buzzing in my head and bringing me down. The fact that I am so underappreciated at times. I do it to myself. I wish I could stop.

I used to struggle HEAVILY with severe anxiety and my parents would belittle it until I was having anxiety attacks and even then they said that therapists were for crazy people (my parents are very traditional and care about what others could say about you). My boyfriend was always there for me even though, at the time, my anxiety wad mainly caused by him (emotionally). He understood and was the only one who could calm me down.  Post emotional shit I was also very depressed because I was disappointed in the person I became. Because morally I'm very black and white and I let my boyfriend fall in my Gray space.

"Hi all.
This is my first post on reddit even though I've used it for quite a long time and I haven't even made a single comment, either. The reason for that is because I've got severe cyber anxiety (scientifically discovered yet or not). Despite having many ideas and experiences to share online, the fear of being attacked, mocked, insulted or looked down prevents me every time. Like many of people here, I've also got social anxiety and depression, accompanied with a naturally boring personality, which make it nearly impossible for me to make friends and maintain relationship. In my secondary and high school, I used to have a number of close friends who valued me, wished me a happy birthday every year and even gave me small birthday presents but not anymore since I went to college and suffered from depression for the first time. I didn't contact them anymore so they probably thought I lost interest in them and let me go too, while it was just my depression which kept me from maintaining relationship in my life. Throughout these years, I've only got groupwork mates, fake friends (been bullied and stabbed in the back by them) and some regular acquaintances, all of whom don't care to be my close friends inspite of my kindness and will to be friends with them. Yesterday was my birthday and I planned to turn the internet off that day because I didn't want to stare at the truth that no one would care about me, no one would wish me a happy birthday although they all got notification of it on SNS. Today, I turned on the internet trying to trick myself that today was just another regular day, no birthday ever happened in order to hurt less but it was in vain. Like previous years, no notifications of any birthday wishes from anyone, even one college friend who treats me quite well (but he probably doesn't consider me a worthy friend, which I've felt so far).
I'm not the type to show my misfortune and vulnerability to anyone beside my parents because I'm really scared to be laughed at or attacked, it took me much of my courage to share it here for I couldn't keep it in my chest any longer. I didn't intend to make it this long at first. I have longed for someone's empathy even if it comes from a stranger on the internet because I need to feel that I'm still connected with the world, to feel that someone still considers me a human being with the need of being cared for, not an unworthy person for anyone to give a sht like I've been. Although I have wanted to take my life and nearly attempted to do it many times, I couldn't do it because I've still got my parents who love me. Maybe in the future after they've left me, I might do it but not now, so I need a reason to keep going.",4,"College, suffered , cyber anxiety, misfortune, vulnerability scared to be laughed at or attacked"

Nothing is ok here. The only things that stay the same are music and books, and I have no time for books most of the days.

They're constantly worsening the conditions here. I have 8 more months and they stretch forever. I'd have killed myself long ago if I didn't know it's going to be over.

"I'm 18 and have never really been able to make any friends.  I spent this new year alone again.

Hearing about my parents talking with old school friends about who used to go out with who, and asking me how my 'love life' is going keeps reminding me of how unlikely it is I'm ever going to function in society.  My parents met and started going out when they were younger than me and I'm still a virgin.

My ssris don't cure my loneliness and only help in a superficial, enough energy to get out of bed sort of way.

Idk why I'm posting this but I really just want to die, I have since I was 11 and have thought about it just about every day since I was around 13.  I just don't see anything to look forward to in life.  Every day I wake up and force myself to go to the gym, then sit around all day trying to find something good to watch or get enough energy to do something productive, then lie in bed and can never fall asleep within 6 hours.  Even youtube sucks now.

I'm so sleep deprived and lonely, hopefully I'll just die from a heart attack or a stroke or something.

I don't know what it is that I'm doing wrong, it seems to come to most people so naturally - socialising - but I guess I'm just not one for life.",4,never really been able to make any friends
"Welp, I made it to 2018, these past few months have been absolutely terrible yet filled with many good memories, and I've met new people and made new friends too. Things are looking okay so far, I'm talking to a sweet and kind girl that I hope I can have a future with, and I've found something to be excited about. That something being music, specifically Metal and Dungeon Synth. I've also gathered a bit of energy and motivation and can hopefully use that to lose weight and learn some instruments. Hopefully things stay this way, because I'm still a sad fuck and any little thing can send me back to where I was a couple nights ago. Lonely, crying, and wanting to scatter my brains around my room because I felt like a worthless angry fuck. Well, I still feel the same but it isn't as bad as it was then. Man, I really hope I can improve this year, I don't want to make it my last.
",4,"Lonely, crying,"
"I want to talk to her today about how I feel. I feel like shit, lonely all the time, it even pains me when I breath sometimes. I want to talk to her maybe she can send me to a doctor to see help me.

But I'm really afraid I'm gonna start crying and make her sad. I don't want to make her sad and I'm crying as I'm typing this. I know she wants the best for me but I want her to think I'm happy and to not worry about me. I want her to feel proud of me. I don't know what to do.",4,but I want her to think I'm happy and to not worry about me
"Today is my birthday, it's supposed to be happy, I'm supposed to be happy. But thing didn't go well in my family, everyone was shouting and blaming each others, then my dad blamed it on me. I didn't care but tomorrow I have finals, I'm already stressed out enough. I wanted to go to a library or a coffee shop to study and forget all about this shit, but then my dad pointed at me and said that if I dared to go out I'm out forever. My mom told me to go my room (she's with me, she cares for me and she doesn't want me get hurt). So I went to my room. Inside, I still heard my dad blaming me for the nuisance I didn't ask for. I grabbed my phone and typed ""Thank you"" to all the texts my friends sent me to wish me a happy birthday. I tried to keep myself positive. 
But then the feelings just hit me hard. It was like a switch. The second after that, I already felt the water all over my face as I threw the glass on the floor. 
I felt...satisfied. The inside of me screamed ""Yes, you did it!"". I played safe with all my life, as the sweet little girl I was. But I know my emotions are unstable and my mental is crumble as hell. I never had the gut to do that, I've always swallowed all the hatred and sadness. So this time instead of crying and writing down all the sadness, I actually did something to show it. Of course my parents went to my room immediately. My mom didn't say much but my dad kept saying how disappointed he was. My dad had a perfect picture of a standard family which the females are always gentle and never fight back. So this incident must make him consider me a failure or something like that.
As I cleaned the mess, he just kept talking. Now he blamed it on my mom that she didn't raise me as a good obedient girl. It made me feel maybe I shouldn't have been born at all. I couldn't tell him that before I'm a girl, his daughter, I am a human. I have emotions. I'm not some doll to bend for his liking. 
I love my dad, I know he love me back too. But the difference between the ideal daughter of him and the actual me is miles away.  
I felt like because of the relationship between me and my family I'm living like a switch. I lost interest in living, I don't see the point of moving on. After all, my life will be a boring cycle. I'm scared that someday I will be crazy enough to actually end my life since I always have that thought at the back of my head. Today I already made the first step. I'm constantly pushed and pulled between living a normal life and depression. 
Tomorrow will be very awkward and stiff, I don't know how to face my family and tell them that I'm really crazy and dead inside.
Maybe I'm truly not suitable for living. For all the achievements and love I get, I still feel so empty. Nothing matters. I love some Kpop idols to learn to love someone wholeheartedly and think that they would love me back. It soothes my poor soul and I have someone to think of instead of thinking about my life. But I know it's just me finding reasons to continue living on.
I'm young, barely 20, good at school, well loved by friends and family. 
Still, I sucks at living. ",4,"didn't go well in my family, everyone was shouting and blaming each others"
"I do. Every time I look back on my past and even in my present I try to justify my shitty behavior because I keep thinking that maybe I'm just a good person on the inside.

"Everything has just gone pear shaped. I had a great year on the whole, things really started to look up until they came crashing down. My mental state has been in decline for a few months and it's finally culminating in the destruction of everything good in my life. 2018 is shaping up to be utter dog shite.
I can't even tell the story, it is so complicated and spans over 3 years. It's all becoming too much and I really just want out. I don't even want to end it all, I just want to start again. I'm about to lose my girlfriend and that feels like the final straw. I walked out to the bridge last night, I really wanted to do it but on the way I talked myself out of it. It felt like as I walked there I left the reality that was torturing me and then as I approached my house on the way back, all the anxiety and fear and pain started to kick back in. I just got back in and cried for hours. My just-about-still girlfriend spoke to me and managed to level me. Today I'm back to square one where I think she's going to leave me, I can tell she wants and she should after that way I've treated her recently. I took my problems out on her and treated her terribly. I'm getting my just deserts. 
When she leaves me, I'll fail my exams, drop out and who knows. I don't know how I'm going to cope. My life was once so good.",4,about to lose my girlfriend and that feels like the final straw

"Besides my therapist, the only person I really open up to in a serious way is my best friend. Only one out of my tons of friends. For everyone else, I only talk about depression in a comedic manner, making jokes about it and laughing. I do that because I feel Iâm supposed to be the fun one in the group, and while I think I am (I always make them and myself laugh), if I get super serious theyâll either make fun of me, stop being my friend, or get super worried and tell someone. I donât want any of those to happen.

Anyway, back to my best friend. Since sheâs the one Iâm serious with, I constantly talk to her about things that bother me, my true feelings, and how suicidal I am. Iâm starting to feel like Iâm being a nuisance, constantly talking to her about these dark things. She doesnât need to hear all of that. She pities me, as do all of my other friends. I really donât want to annoy her with how much Iâve been telling her.

Recently, she even said that she feels very depressed, and sheâs been talking to me about it. She never mentioned me doing anything to make her feel like that, but I feel like I was a part in it. My texts probably affected her a lot. It hurts to think that, but I feel thatâs the truth. Anyway, sorry about how long this was. I could go on and on about this, so I hope you understand.

"Hi. I was having a nice day with everyone at home but as soon as the sun went down, so did I. I feel distant to some people and I'm scared I might lose contact with them. I'm anxious, does my person still love me even if he just told me he loves me. We're in a long distance relationship and it's getting harder for me too. But I have no idea why do I feel so down right now...

I took my meds, I take Lexapro and Klonopin, I even added a little dose to my Klonopin. I ate everything that I wanted to eat even if I wasn't supposed to.

"I have had depression since the beginning of 2013. 

A year later however, I became somewhat a popular kid in school.  Having friends and being the center of attention stopped my depression. 

However, a string of events happened where most of my friends left me to rot alone. And for the last 3 years, I find myself having no friends. Most of my old ""best mates"" pretend we never knew each other in the first place. Everyone who I loved don't care about me. 

I went from being the happiest kid on the planet, to now a loser that no one talks to. I am so haunted by this experience, it's hard for me to socially interact with anyone. I find myself trapped in my own body like a prison and I just want to kill myself. 

I just want friends.",4,string of events happened where most of my friends left me to rot alone
"On New Years Eve, I was so convinced that I was going to spend it alone. And I was going to end my meaningless life on new year. 

I ended up spending it with my boyfriend, who made me realised that I was actually cared for, and loved, and gave me a chance at believing that I would have a future in front of me. Letting someone be the reason for me to live isn't going to be good in the long run, but as for now, it's good enough. I actually want to stick around and see what happens. Maybe it's going to turn out fine, and not as bad as my thoughts were telling me. 

He held my face and made me look into his eyes. He whispered that he loves me and didn't want me to leave. He said that he will never ever find anyone else. I don't know why or how, but it was as if he knew what was going through my head. I never told him my plans after all. I felt bad and wanted to cry. He made me promise that I am never going to leave him alone. He knew. He is a precious and beautiful person. I cant bear ever breaking his heart and destroying his life. I've decided that I'm going to try my hardest to commit to having a good life with him. I just don't want to pass my suffering onto anyone. I know what that's like. 

Having said that, i'm always scared and anxious that I won't have the strength to fight my demons. I know that he would always be there for me and not let me fight my battles alone. And sometimes I'm scared that he might leave, and I wouldn't know what else to do. I just want to be happy with the person I love. I hope that 2018 allows me to do that.
