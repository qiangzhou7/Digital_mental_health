"It's difficult to explain. Like before, if I'd laugh, it'd be a very stifled and unsatisfying laugh. As if when you have your yawn interrupted, but just with a laugh. Or as if I was laughing somewhere where I wasn't supposed to be and was trying my hardest not to, but just every time.

Recently, I've just been having these really naturally drawn out and full laughs. They're comfortable and satisfying. I don't know why but it's pretty awesome. Don't know if it's a sign of me getting better or something. Anyone else ever had that?",0,

"Watching the hole in the ever-fading light. Itâs the size of a baby now, closing all the time. Narrower and narrower, until thereâs barely room to fit an arm through. Iâm thinking about quenching the light before the hole shutsâthis is just tortureâwhen a face suddenly appears. Itâs Bran. The spell has passed and heâs come back. He wants to get through, to be with me. But the holeâs too small. He punches it, pulls at it, slips his fingers into the gap and strains with all his mightâbut itâs no good. The rock continues to grind together. The hole gets smaller, the width of a finger now.
At the last moment, Bran presses his mouth up to the hole and roars with raw pain and loss, at the top of his voice, âBec!â Itâs the only time heâs ever uttered my name. Anyoneâs name. His anguished cry stabs at my heart and tears spring to my eyes. I open my mouth to shout his own name back, to offer whatever small shred of comfort I canâ¦ but then the rock closes all the way and a fierce rumbling drowns out the echoes of Branâs cry.
I stare at the solid rock. My mouth closes. The light fades. Darkness",0,

My emotions have been getting out of hands lately and I'm so tired.,0,
"Hey, first post on here!
I feel weird. I don't feel bad, just weird. I've been feeling like this for quite a while. Like two years or something.
Let me give you some background. I'm a 16 y/o dude living in Norway. I have it well. Life is good to me. 
I get good grades at school (B/A), I have (some) friends, I have a nice family (my parents got divorced ~3 years ago, but that's fine).
Everything is just fine.

But somehow I feel like my whole life is ""meh"". I don't see any point in doing anything. 
I have hobbies; I like video games, I play the piano, I make videos, I do some photography. I have interest in politics. 
I go to a school where I do things I like; photography, video game design (yes, Norway is weird and privileged), video editing etc.

I just lose motivation so quickly. ""Oh, I'll play this game."" Ten minutes go by. ""Uh, this is boring/unrewarding/I could be doing something better/etc."" 
Or; ""Oooh, I'll make this video game."" I work on it for 2 days. ""I could just go back to not doing anything, and not have to do this.""
I've been trying different things. I don't know why this happens, really. Do I think long-term before I think short-term?

One good (recent) example of this is New Year's Eve; everyone is emotional and screaming ""Happy New Year"" like it's some sort of rebirth. No. 
The number in the calendar is different, and there's gonna be another Christmas in 12 months. That's all there is to it in my opinion.

I don't know, is there some secret to life? Am I just gonna one day wake up, feel completely different, and have endless energy to do everything?

(P.S. I don't know if this qualifies as ""depression"". If this shouldn't be posted here, could somebody direct me to somewhere this can be posted?)",0,

"I guess depression doesn't truly go away, but does it ever get better? 
Like instead of wanting to die every single day, maybe once a week or twice a month. Or not feeling so lifeless and being able to enjoy life once in awhile? 

What's the point if it doesn't get better? Because then I'm just living to avoid giving my parents depression over my death.",0,

"Today I talked to my parents for the first time about my depression I have been dealing with. I was very apprehensive and nervous about how they would react. They were very understanding and sympathetic, and my dad told me it actually runs in our family. Going to see someone next week. 
It's a start and feels like I'm on track to getting better. Anyone out there who is too nervous to reach out for help, or too proud to do it, just do it! 
It helped me, hopefully others will give it a try.
Happy new year!",0,

"Hello,
I was wondering if there are nations where you are given the chance to kill yourself in a assisted way, so I could release myself from this torment that I'm currently in.

I read about holland giving all depressed people a easy way out, and I was wondering if as a foreign person I could use their service. It doesn't matter if I've got to pay, I will pay all what I need to if I can get out.

Thanks a lot.",0,
"Lately I've been feeling really shitty and very depressed. I feel like I should be really happy, I have a new girlfriend who is great, my family is healthy. But for some reason I just feel so depressed all the time. At first I thought it was because I wasn't with my new girlfriend, because it seems to go away when ever I'm with her. But I've noticed it sometimes even when we are together. Does anyone know any ways to try and keep my mind off depression and how to feel better?",0,
"I already told someone I was suicidal and was put in a mental hospital. A couple days later I was released and suicidal again. I'm still thinking of killing myself, but don't want to tell anyone because I'm just going to be put in a hospital again and come out suicidal. It sucks I have to lie to people. I want help, but not *that* kind of help.",0,

I'm 26. Family events are awkward. I see having kids as incredibly selfish. I'm just waiting for the world to fall apart at this point. Maybe something interesting will happen during Trump's presidency.,0,
My self worth is sort of plummeting. Earlier I was thinking about how much better it would be if I just died. I feel like nobody really cares. I can't shake the idea that I probably just don't deserve to be happy,0,
"I just was hoping a few people could weigh in on their experiences with anti-depressants and tell me the good and bad experiences they've had. I'm not particularly fond of the idea of having to swallow a pill in order to feel happy but if I can do something to feel good everyday and not like this then I wonder if it's worth it? I went to the doctors a while back and they tried to offer me some but I never took them and I don't think he really got in my head that well, mainly because I didn't want to let some stranger in.

"Hi guys, so long story short I broke down in front of my parents twice in the last 10 days and poured my mind out (ugly crying, snotty and all, a wreck), told them everything. Mum knows a psychiatrist and she will most likely be making me an appointment with her any day now. I'm actually kind of curious what it's like (although I know that once it will be time to go I will shit myself). They still think I'm not really sick even though I'm riddled through but at least they aren't dismissing or guilt tripping me bu understanding.

Should I tell her I wanna die ? Or will that lend me in a ward ? 

Should I take pills even tho I keep reading how people regret ever getting them and want to get off them and the withdrawals are the worst thing they have ever had to go through ? It kind of discourages me..

Also I'm not US based, so I'm just looking for some more general advice",0,
