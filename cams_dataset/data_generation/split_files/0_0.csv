SOOO FUCKING EMBARRASSING btw. Prior to this moment I fantasized about dying a hand full of times this year, it just hasnât been the best year for me with a lot more terrible lows than ups, but at that moment when i realized that my life is so precious and delicate and at any moment it can all be gone forever without showing any warning. I now understand that the possibility of taking my own life would be the most brainless decision I could ever make and I am thankful that I didnât no matter how bad shit may be in my life. I know shit can be tough and I know that the pain hurts but nothing can hurt as bad as being gone forever. Today was probably the best day of my year because I didnât die by death from chicken and waffle. I donât want to push my ideas on anyone or anything but I hope this can help someone out.

"Hi, I'm Jake. I'm from England where it's currently 00:06 and I'm not sure why I'm writing this but I guess I need to put my thoughts somewhere (like a diary of sorts.)
I've felt dreadful for about 3 years now, progressively getting worse to the point of hating every fibre of my being. I've never really spoken to anyone about my thoughts or feelings, so maybe I'm not depressed, maybe it's normal to feel like this, but something tells me it isn't.
However, I am not here for sympathy. I'm writing this because I intend to turn my life around in 2018, I want to lose weight, put more work into university, maybe pick up some hobbies and TRY to be more social. So I intend to return to this post in 3 months or 6 months or a year when I've hopefully managed to change my life for the better, and I hope YOU can do the same, whoever you are, wherever you are.

I hope you have a fantastic year, god bless you.

"To me, depression is a gaping pit I always spiral down into, further into darkness. It's not something you can rid yourself of JUST with a positive attitude, but I'd like to believe that it helps. My reasons for posting this is to vent, but also that someone may feel that they can get something out of this.

So I wanted to write something with the emphasis on that ONE thing I got going for me in 2017, and that I hope to bring with me to 2018. I internalize most things, but I do realize how others have a very strong impact on my well-being, and for the first time, I got some warm feelings.

The new year nothing:

locking in the new year with a lot of bang,

just me and the fam, the sun, the favorite gang

lights and booms all around they rang,

everyone put to sleep, and I'm working on this song

there's nothing new but people make it into a thang,

but that doesn't make it any less true

It's the new year nothing and I still ain't got a clue,

depression is alive in whatever place I lay and hang

hoping for a miracle, but I think that one is you,

stick around to witness, I'm starting something new

caught up with my shadow, the myself that I once knew,

I gotta say, you got me feeling great through and through

it's the new year nothing but now i know what to do,

self-pity was the norm, but now I look foward to

the new year nothing that's bringing me a tattoo,

and for once, i'm done with all this deja vu!",0,

"Hello everybody.

So, you know those people that don't really have depression but pretend they do? Yeah, this is me. It doesn't mean life is easy for me, everything is still very difficult and was like that for the past 5-6 months. It's just not bad enough to be called depression. Everybody else has it much, *much* worse. I just don't really feel good anymore. And I just know that I'm pretending and I don't really deserve anything because of this. I'm just in this gray zone where it's not bad enough to remotely think about getting any help I don't deserve but not good enough for me to be happy. And everything is just getting worse.

"Time moves forward
I'm lost in translation 
Another year with added fear
Stuck in my rumination 

Strange beauty in sadness
Takes you to a level where you empathise with the world
So much madness around me
I can't block the outside noise

I don't want to be happy
I just want vitality 
Pain inside eats me away like a cavity 
Weighed down by more then gravity

Still I fight
Something magical about night 
Able to reflect like the moon
So many questions so many whys?

"This is quite difficult to talk about with people I know, or therapists for that matter, so I'm hoping this platform of strangers will make things easier...

I've had these thoughts for roughly 5-years now, with the exception of a 4-month stretch, when I felt happy (literally for the first and only time). 

The thought of killing myself is not only terrifying, I know that it's wrong (in every sense of the word). I'd never want to put my family through that, nor myself; however, I can't help but fantasize about the idea of some freak accident occurring to put me out of this misery.  

My struggles with my happiness stem from a very young age, and things simply have not gotten better. The 4-month stretch was beyond surreal. It was when I realized I had never been happy before, and unfortunately not since. 

The idea of some freak accident ending my life is so appealing; it would end my depressing thoughts and feelings, would take the guilt off of my hands (instead of doing it myself), and while it would still be crushing to my family, it wouldn't have the added drama of ""what could we have done to help?"" The idea of living life for another ~50-years with the absence of happiness truly sounds awful, not worth it in the slightest.

This feeling of depression weaving in and out of my life is slowly destroying me. After writing this, I would be fine and back to enforcing optimism...and then slowly depression crawls back again. I'm exhausted of this up and down wheel of emotions. I'm tired of feeling bad about everything. I want to fix myself but I don't know how or whether I can.",0,

"Why do you think you don't deserve to be happy?

Is it because you think you are a bad person or that you made a bad decision?  Is it because you think you have nothing to offer to the world?  What if I told you that you don't have to be a bad person.  Forgive yourself for making a bad decision and promise yourself you won't do it again, what good is it to continue to beat yourself up about it?  It is not making you a better person, you are not becoming happier.  You may think you have nothing to offer; but I bet when you convince yourself you do, you will have something to offer.  If you think you don't deserve to be happy, you are wrong.

Being happy isn't just going to come to you.  You aren't going to wake up feeling like you are on top of the world.  You have to make it happen.  You have to decide to get up and be the best you can.  It takes practice to be happy, you have to work at it.  

Depression, atleast from my point of view, has been highly self inflicted.   I chose to stop eating, I chose to stop trying, I chose to stop caring, I chose to stop talking to those around me, and I chose to stop doing the things I once loved to do.  

I and you need to choose to to be happy.  You need to choose to get healthy.  You need to choose to get out of bed. You need to choose to start caring.  You need to choose to love those around you.

Someone loves you, if you don't think that then I believe someone will love you if you put yourself in the position for them to love you.  

You deserve to be happy.  You REALLY deserve to be happy.  Try to be happy, no matter how hard it may seem.  Being happy is the point of life.",0,choose to love those around you
