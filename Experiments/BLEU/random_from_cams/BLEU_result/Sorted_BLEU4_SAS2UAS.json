But hey, at least they're both better than being depressed, right?\"\n\nIn this post, the individual attributes the difference between sertraline and fluoxetine to their personal experience with side effects, rather than looking for external factors or considering the possibility that both medications may be effective for different people. This demonstrates a stable attributional style because it implies that the cause of the difference in effectiveness is chronic (stable) and inherent to the individual, rather than looking for other factors that could be influencing the outcome.",

The phrase \"they're nothing but tiny little pests\" suggests that the speaker views the ants as insignificant and temporary obstacles, rather than a persistent problem. Additionally, the use of the phrase \"at least I'm not the one being squashed like a bug\" implies that the speaker recognizes that their actions may have consequences, but views them as temporary and manageable. Overall, the transferred post reflects a more optimistic and less stable attributional style than the original post.",
