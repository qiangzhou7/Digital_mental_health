But hey, at least I'm not the one being squashed like a bug. #AntsArePests #SquashingIsFun #DesensitizationIsKey\"\n\nIn this transferred post, the language has been modified to reflect an unstable attributional style, indicating that the cause of the event is temporary and transient, rather than chronic and stable. The phrase \"they're nothing but tiny little pests\" suggests that the speaker views the ants as insignificant and temporary obstacles, rather than a persistent problem. Additionally, the use of the phrase \"at least I'm not the one being squashed like a bug\" implies that the speaker recognizes that their actions may have consequences, but views them as temporary and manageable. Overall, the transferred post reflects a more optimistic and less stable attributional style than the original post."
