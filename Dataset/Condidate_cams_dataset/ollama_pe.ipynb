There\\'s never a moment where it is completely silent and I know it\\'s anxiety and sensory overload, but gosh does it make me angry. My roommates talk CONSTANTLY and they keep me from being able to sleep because all I can concentrate on is their voices. Another example, in one of my classes today, my professor talked non-stop and she\\'s one of those extremely hyper, fast talking, off topic teachers who go off on tangents about things that aren\\'t related to the lesson at all. It was so hard to stay in that class without storming out because I couldn\\'t handle listening to her loud voice any longer.\"\n",

The police weren't hopeful that they will get to find my phone with all of my not-backed up travel photos but at least I survived the day and I can get a new phone! Money doesn't concern me, I'm just really bugged that I won't have all of my photos from two-week travel.
