        "Origin_reddit": "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s currently 4 in the morning and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m feeling very stuck. I feel like nothing has changed since I can remember. For some background, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had depression since about middle school. I guess I still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if I want to call it depression since I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been diagnosed yet but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always just had trouble finding any positivity in my life. In school I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been popular but I could be considered as well liked. From what I know most opinions of me are positive but as I said that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s from what I know. My response to being sad has always been to try and focus on other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problems and try and help them. The problem with this is that all this has done is made me worse off. I feel like no one puts in as much effort into relationships as I do. Friends always seem to be eager to take my advice and then when I ask for help they run. The person I considered to be my best friend did this to me over the course of last year and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still sad about it. We stopped talking for a few months and today they invited me to hang out with them on New Year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Eve but, while I still care about them, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to put myself back  into a relationship where I put my all into it and then I ask for help and end up getting hurt. They tried to help me in the first 2 months that they knew about my depression (I feel like they actually did help me for the duration of the 2 months but for some reason that is hard to admit) and then after that he just gave up on me. That hurt more than anything else because I know I would never give up on him. In the absence of him for the last few months I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried to go to counseling at my school. That worked for a week and then after some work I realized I should get a therapist to help. The counselor had to call one of my parents because, being a minor, I have to get parental consent to get a therapist. She never did. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been about there weeks since she said she would do it. That really helps. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m stuck trying to solve my situation alone because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in it for so long that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve isolated myself from others. The point where I held a gun to my head and almost killed myself is when I think I finally realized something was very wrong with me mentality and I needed to do something about it. That was 6 months ago. Help feels like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so hard to find. My counselor hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t helped, my parents haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, and my past best friend hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I also have other \u00e2\u0080\u009cfriends\u00e2\u0080\u009d that I found security in and then I realized that they talk about me behind my back and make fun of my depression. They also make fun of the same thing with another friend of mine who is in that group and that pisses me off more then them talking about me. 2017 has been the worst year of my life. At least I learned that I need help but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been so hard to find. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made my depression worse and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m starting to lose hope again. In 2018 at the least I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to look at things more positively this year. All that I know is that 2017 has taught me that good help is hard to find. That is why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sitting here at 4am on a reddit account I just created venting to the void.\nThanks for reading my huge wall of text. I hope something in all of my rambling possibly related to you and helped a little bit. Good luck in 2018 and I hope this year works out for you. I know I need it to work out for me. Thanks again and have a happy New Year. ",

I woke up around 3 in the morning and stupidly checked my phone. When I did I saw all the friends that bailed on me at different parties, surrounded by others, having fun. This sent me spiraling back into depression and I found myself close to ending my life with a belt which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read can be very painless.

Just an interaction with another human being would warm my heart.\n\n\nTo cut a long story short, I've had this crush on a girl for well over a year now. Not a day goes by when I don't think about her and checking her social media accounts has became part of my daily routine. She lives overseas and there is a significant age difference, I'm 15 and she's 20. \n\n\nFor a few hours after I wake up, she's all I think about and it causes a nauseating feeling in my stomach. (Also, has anyone else been through this or know what it is?)\n\nUnlike most crushes, I recognise her flaws. She's passive aggressive, a humble bragger, a control freak, a spoilt girl who grew up in a mansion. But she's not an awful person, far from. I relate to her in so many ways. That's how I can see through her little act. She's insecure about her appearance and how people perceive her and has admitted to being depressed in the past. \n\n\nI only know her through her social media presence. But I'm certain I would make her so happy if I were her boyfriend. I'd take care of her, let her cry in my arms and vent about her problems all night. I'd take care of her.\n\n\nI suppose some things aren't meant to be, we live in different countries, we're different ages and she doesn't even fucking know me. Despite this, I can't just get over her and move on. I can't even distract myself, all I think about is her. Like I've said, I've been this way for years. Is this fate trying to tell me there is a chance or just my depression trying to beat me down and get me to get my hopes up?\n\n\nAnyone been through anything like this or know how to move forward? Also, sorry about the cringe-worthy \"I'd be good the best boyfriend\" speech I typed out earlier. I know it's so clich\u00c3\u00a9, but I think it needed to be said. \n\n\nOh, and happy New Years!",

My brain fell into cycles of self degradation way too easily, this led me down a spiral this year which made me end a long relationship, lose some friends, and made me put duties that would have helped me to the wayside like taking my dog out.\n\nThe past few months leading to now has been anti social to say the least. I stopped trying to make plans with friends as I was tired of hearing no, my friends clearly didn't want me around a whole lot (since September I had a total of 2 outings with friends, pre September we spent probably too much time together at ~6 days a week). On top of that another good friend of mine moved away indefinitely. \n\n2017 I realized I can't rely on my friends the way I thought I could, I wish I could but life doesn't work like that. My New Years resolution this year is to not base my happiness and social success around if my friends and I are having fun. I've realized I don't need my friends to go play an open Mic night, or go see a movie, or to go for a hike, in fact a lot of these are better done alone.\n\n2017 my friends left me high and dry\n\n2018 they're not gonna be able to",

Grabbed my pack and just ran. They tried to bring me back. T'was a whole chase scene with jumping over walls and shet. \n\nBut i couldn't. After however many hours, I went back. I never got anything when I returned but a single lecture about how nobody is gonna care if I do it again bc I'm 19. They're probably right.\n\nWord travels fast in my family, and I believe I've ruined New Years for everyone. I dont want to face everyone anymore. None of them understand what I'm going through. I have no friends to talk to anymore. My brother and sister ignore me and dont like me. My parents also ignore what I'm going through and suggest that I shouldnt be depressed bc theyre depressed even more. All my aunts and uncles who think they help say that too. \n\nIm rambling at this point...\n\nRight now, im laying in my bed, legs sore, body numb, and drowning in despair. I dont know where to go. I want to end it but im afraid to. I want leave but i dont know where to go. And even if i do, i wont know how to start my life back again and for that, I'm scared.
