She did not do anything half-assed, everything she touched she put her energy into. We were both in tech and had startup dreams. She had to run away from an abusive parent, and ended up staying at my place for a time. I thought we had a genuine connection. But she kept comparing me to her other ex, saying that he left her with high standards. Then she started college and first week she dumps me for a startup hotshot, saying she was tired of waiting for me to improve myself. \n\nSo college came around for me, and I hyped myself up. I was going to work hard, play hard, and have a bunch of sex and meet my next girlfriend and future wife. I was going to meet my cofounder and start a cool company. But none of that really happened. Mechanical engineering was tough and ate up most of my socializing/free time. I was in a new city where I knew zero people. I fell into a rut and dropped out.\n\nAdditionally, I started thinking my current friends and family were boring, and I started distancing myself from them. In retrospect I was too harsh judging them; nevertheless I still feel disconnected from them.\n\nI know It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad to not compare myself to her, but my imagination still runs wild. I cut out Facebook, Twitter, and blocked her out of my life, but I still cannot stop comparing myself to her. She is smart and got an internship for a big tech company right into college, and was getting featured in the local paper. She got invited to tech events and parties.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been three years and my self esteem never recovered. I feel I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve let myself down, not finding a girlfriend and screwing up with engineering. Online dating/hookups didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work. The sexual frustration sucks. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to waste away my twenties being single. I thought about hurting myself, but after sleeping on it I realize that will do no good. \n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in a mental stalemate: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve cut her out of my life, but I still have low self esteem. I see-saw in between being whiny about myself, and angrily wanting to punch every couple in the street. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried three different therapists to little improvement, and my mopey-ness is straining my relationship with my dad. \n\nThings are getting better at a glacial pace, but that feeling of failure still clouts my mind. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve binged many articles/videos (DFW, Alan Watts, School of Life, etc.), started going to sleep earlier, and started journaling. However, the feeling of failure still affects my day-to-day where I can barely keep my job. I still get discouraged on even the most minor of challenges. \n",

        "Origin_reddit": "This new year looks like it might be the year I kill myself. I'm so beyond done now.\n\nI am 26, male, and I feel like my life is over. My family financially ruined me to the point where I feel like I shouldn't even bother trying to fix my life. Due to some circumstances I ended up moving to a town I hate living in, and can barely afford. It's in the american countryside. I hate the american countryside. I deeply hate it. I've never enjoyed myself in the country. I also don't drive, so that makes it suck more. That's just venting though. Some more venting, I've been financially supporting my parents for some years to the point of abuse. I've been saving up to buy a car the last year. 3 times I made it to about 3 grand. 3 times they've taken it, once my took it mom bought herself a car instead. Broke down 2 months later too. then her husband had a heart attack. Then they got themselves an eviction notice. I paid the entirety of their rent the last 2 months. I hate them. But. I can't drive, I have no savings, I am stuck in a place I hate living with people I hate living with and I afford it by working a job I hate and I can't do anything about it because I can't drive and I have no savings, no one will help me drive and my parents keep taking my savings. So it's never going to get better. I have no friends. None. Not a single one. Not for about 3 years. I've disowned my family, aside from my mother but If by some miracle I save some money up and can leave, or she dies without leaving my homeless, then I'm done with her too. So. In my heart I've disowned my family and have no desire to ever contact anyone I share blood with for as long as I live. Which probably isn't very long.\n\nI am completely isolated, very socially awkward, financially a failure. Well. Really I'm mostly just a failure. Like, in every way. I feel like I'm the biggest loser in the world. \n\nIt really bothers me that I didn't do this to myself though. It would be so much better if I did this to myself, cause then I could stop it. Or I could at least take responsibility. I could have power, even if that power ruined my life it'd be mine. But. I go to work and then I basically give all my money to my mother cause she attacks and threatens me otherwise, I have no support system as I have no friends and no one that can and will actually help me, or offer a realistic answer to my problems. People offer shitty advice that has never worked. Staying positive does nothing for me. I can smile all day but It won't get me a car or put money in my pocket. No one I work with is really \"Friend\" material. I feel myself rapidly approaching 30 where \"friends\" become more irrelevant anyway. I feel like I'm going to die alone cause of it. Like, I'll never be allowed to fix up my life and meet someone. I'll never be allowed to save money. I'll never leave the american countryside that I hate living in oh so much. I really doubt I'll ever have sex again, at this point. \n\nI wake up everyday and the first thing I want to do is cry cause I hate being alive. Like life is a living hell, there's not a single thing about my life that is the way I actually would like. People tell me to take control without realizing I literally have none no matter how much I try, I can't be homeless cause I'd lose my job and there's no room in shelters cause they have to save so much space for women and they're at capacity with regulars. It's also winter, so I'd probably freeze to death in my area if I have to sleep outside. I want to die, but not like that. I also have no where else to go. Literally no where else. Not a single place in the world, as again, I have no friends or family. I have no power. I have no control. \n\nPeople offer advice completely ignorant of the fact that I have no resources. I can't leave the house under my own ability, I can't get up and go whenever to wherever. I also have no privacy when leaving the house cause of that. So outside of going to work I don't really leave. I feel like a prisoner. I have no power, I have no resources.\n\nAt this point I really think I should just kill myself. I'm rapidly approaching 30, I'm all alone in the world, I have no savings, my personality isn't anything anyone would enjoy at this point. I'm like broken and hollowed out. Just twisted up inside. I'm really no worthy catch in any department, as a friend or more. I often get told I'm handsome though. There's that. It's pretty worthless too. Like, girls I'm attracted too will tell me I'm attractive but my personality sucks too much for it to help. I get looks or fuck me eyes occasionally, no one really talks to me though. I was good with girls when I was younger. But. I had guy friends that would like, invite me along to places to meet women and then they started to kinda bash me and make me look bad. Like, I was bait, and a set up; so they could look good and get laid. So. That stopped. Then I self isolated. Then, I had to move. Then life isolated me. I'm in the middle of nowhere and every attempt at making friends has failed. Even meeting people in general, dating sites in my area don't have very many users. Only enough for like 3 pages in a search on POF. It's boring. I hate it. So, there's not a lot to choose from and it's already gone badly. So I'm alone. All alone. \n\nAll alone, in a town I hate, with people I hate, wasting my time on a job I hate that doesn't actually benefit me cause I can't build up savings. I can't save up to drive. I can't save up to leave. I can't get my mother out of my life. I wake up and feel like crying. I feel like crying all day. I feel like crying now. It's like this every day. It's been like this for years now. So, waiting it out is not an option. This won't pass. It's not stopping. Nothings getting better, it's getting worse and worse. I really just can't anymore.\n\nI think it's just time to go ahead and kill myself. I've really struggled and put in serious effort to fix my life, and it's not happening. I'm sick of assholes with bad advice and I am sick of trying.\n\nI'm done. I am quite literally done, actually. This is the end of me.",

To hear where and what my classmates have been doing during christmas and NYE, and having to worry about assignments and such. It's gonna be tough. But on the plus side, it will be my last year. Hopefully after that I get lots of time to try and get better. Maybe sooner if I fail. My grades have plummeted during the last year, but I try to not think about it too much. Chances are that my disability combined with my depression will render me unable to work, and I am very fortunate to live in a country where the disabled get financial aid.\n\nPerhaps the NEET life will give me the time I need to find interests and develop a personality beyond that shy, crippled person with few words to spare. I will also hopefully get a driver's license this year or the next. I don't know what I will do with it, but it feels nice to know that I will be able to drive.

I also had romantic feelings for someone, and I even had visions for a future with them. A happy future. I haven't had something like that in years. I even paid them a visit to meet in person. It was really exciting to travel abroad to meet an online friend. With that being said, we sort of fell apart shortly after I went home. Most likely a combination of my habit of shutting myself away when depressed, in addition to their depression. Maybe we will meet again sometime. \n\nI'm not really sure what to think about life anymore. I don't feel much sadness. Not like I used to. Just indifference towards everything. Like I don't care about anything anymore. I should be frightened to think that I tried to end my life. Sad that I split from my romantic interest without even a goodbye. Angry at myself for how I treat myself. But there is nothing. I feel like I've experienced what I need to experience. I've been happy. I've had friends. Moments of intense pain. Anger. Sadness.

To put it simply enough, every thought, person, and location feels bizarre and unreal and detached and profoundly difficult and overwhelming. I feel like an alien life form who has been suddenly thrown into a human life and body, even though I've had 19 years of this existence. Or maybe I feel like nothing at all in an empty vessel others take for a human. Maybe that's a better way of putting it. I have been severely depressed and anxious as long as I can remember (I tried to throw myself in front of a car when I was 7), but this feeling is new. Am I dissociating? This morning (5 PM actually, morning for me) my dad, who I really like and respect and who has been as supportive as possible for me, came to wake me and I literally forgot for a moment who he was, who I was, and where I was. Although I had been invited to a party, I had spent New Year's Eve the night before alone, crying and thinking about death and viscerally shocking myself every moment, realizing I still existed. To get back to the point of this rant, the most basic things like material objects and gravity and other people feel apart from me and almost sinister. I dropped out of high school, got a GED, and failed or stopped attending two community college classes, all the while sporadically working three different jobs all of which I was fired from or quit after about two months. I've been talking to a few girls who seem very interested in me, but whenever it comes time to seal the deal or set a date, I just... don't. I don't know why. I'm just so tired of it all and I can't begin to imagine decades more of this life without having a panic attack. Last night I began writing my suicide note even without any particular plan in mind, but it felt cathartic, realer than anything I've experienced in years. I think I'd use sleeping pills. Other than that, music, which I listen to all the time, is my only anchor. Usually I only begin to feel alive when contemplating my death. At least I have control over that, and my memory would be viewed with rose tinted glasses, better than anything I could ever actually be. This post will probably be paid no attention because that's just how life goes for me, and that's not bait for attention. Whatever. At least I could put my thoughts down.",

During that time I took Zoloft with a Xanax PRN for panic attacks. Earlier this year (around May 2017) my primary doctor upped my dosage by 50mg, I was then taking 150mg. My body adjusted to the increase and I hated how it made me feel. I felt worse than before. As if it worsened my symptoms. So, full well knowing the dangers of stopping a medication like Zoloft, I stopped taking it around the end of July 2017. \n\nAt first I was fine. Them a month had gone by and I was bad. Then a few months later (Nov 2017) I was the worst I had ever been in my life. I lost 20lbs from Thanksgiving to now... I don't have an appetite, even though I feel hungry all the time. I have extreme fatigue. I am always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I am stressed because student loans kick in this month ($515 a month), and I cannot afford to visit my family doctor because of $ I owe from previous visits. \n\nIs this 20lb sudden weight loss something that can be attributed to depression? I am generally a very healthy person. I workout daily, but haven't been able to the past month because of my extreme fatigue and depression. That's why it confuses me as to why I've lost weight. \n\nI am 22, female, athletic build, 6'0\" and 178lbs.\nSorry if this is in the wrong subreddit. If it is, please direct me elsewhere.

Well about five years ago I started hurting myself via cutting and I was found out and taken to a hospital. And at the time I had a friend who also self harmed but neither one of us knew the other did it. My parents were good friends with the schools principal and he told them this which immediately led to them blaming her for corrupting me basically and no matter how many times I told them this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t true they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t listen. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the hospital and my parents told the doctors this and I could tell they immediately took me/my case less serious and after a series of vague question (usually what are your grades, how clean is your room etc ) the doctor told my parents I was faking it for attention. I was put into therapy and starting out I had three therapists but over the course of a year I worked my way down to one. At the end of that year the last one was kicked off of my case. But throughout that year I still self harmed and have off and on ever since. Well now to the point ig, my mum has always told me that she cares/loves me but has done nothing to try and help me (outside of that therapy which she constantly told me was useless) I have gotten caught self harming multiple times but have never been taken to the hospital since the first time, I have told her that I feel suicidal and have been struggling with the urge to not hurt myself and I asked if I could go back to therapy. That was a month ago and she hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t said anything about it or even asked how I was doing. Then today I slept late because I didnt fall asleep until 7am and she was yelling at me for being lazy then told me that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m depressed because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m always sleeping or in my room, and then told someone else that when she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know I could hear her. But there have also been times where she gets upset because I dont talk to her about stuff. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just wondering if someone can help me understand her thought process because I Have been trying to for years and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Also sorry if this is super confusing.

I liked to blame my tendencies to stay locked up at home on my laziness, but now I find myself taking a stroll around my neighborhood every once in a while. I never really thought I was a full blown hikikomori as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve maintained a job for a short period where I had to interact with customers.,. I live in a very busy part of New York so there are many faces to look at and imagine where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all headed.\n\n\nI recently applied for college as a returning student for the spring semester which is why I think it may just be anxiety or even college-mid life crisis because I am doubting my career path.\n\n\n\nI need to prep for some of the classes as I have forgotten a lot f the materials.. it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a good year since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone to college. I know I should be studying, but I seem to be pushing the schedule back. I even planned out my schedule on my calendar app, but I end up just deleting the notifications and telling myself that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do it tomorrow. I hate this part about myself because I feel this is what led me to fall so behind in school. Everyone of my peers who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve cut contact with have already graduated and live a decent life, meanwhile I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve quit my job as a store clerk months ago and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where the time went.\n\n\n\n\nActivities? I stopped gaming but many people get into a period of malaise with this. I seem fill most of my day on reddit and watching shows when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not walking around outside.\n\n\n\n\n\n I move around the house aimlessly; idk what the deal with that is. I find myself walking into the kitchen and forgetting why I went there. I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just watching what I eat. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost a couple of pounds which is great.\n\n\n\nMy sleep schedule is screwed but I am not forcing myself to say in bed longer than I have to. I actually hate laying down with nothing but my thoughts because my mind drifts into odd places that make me sad. I wonder what would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve happened if my mother didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have issues with the first child. That would mean I would have never been born; my parents had me because the first one didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take.\n\n\nAnyway I think about shit like that so I like to minimize my time laying in bed with nothing else but my thoughts so I end up watching shows on my tablet til I fall asleep. \n\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also never been good with sleeping near electronic devices since I was a kid. Just bad habits I think.\n\n\nI haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attempted or even fantasized about leaving here so I guess that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good. I have written an apology letter to my parents though and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m scared to know what the intent of that was.\n\n\n\n\nWell I hope it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not depression because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m about to get on a medication that has a known side effect that can potentially amplify the sadness. This might be a mess to read through.",
