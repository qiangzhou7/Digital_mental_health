I don't know what to do about any of this other than to keep walking, I am just losing the will to believe in positive things anymore, at least for me in my life.\n\n\nI've had major depressive episodes since I was 15, with these culminating in a hospital stay at 17. Since then I have tried to live with my depressive tendencies and fight, just putting one foot in front of the other and using medicine to help even me out. This year, I've hit a wall I believe.\n\nStarting in January, I noticed my marriage of 8 years was failing, but I stuffed it back in my mind because I didn't want to admit it. This continued until the end of May when I found out about infidelity and apathy on her part. Afterward, I lost most of my support network, with only my mother and father, one life-long friend, and one 1/2 life long friend remaining to help (I lost my extended family 6 or 7 years ago because of lawsuits arising from a death in the family). There is a lot of hurt on both sides, but at this point in time, I don't feel anger will fix anything. I would rather try to get thru this and let her find what she is looking for somewhere else.\n\nI focused on my health to try to forget the pain and found out from my doctors that I will be lucky to live till 60 because of a complex back problem (kyphosis/stenosis/degenerative disc/degenerative bones/arthritis). I was already on pain meds for these conditions, and hoped for some type of surgery to lessen the pain; I was told I am too messed up to fix. I was also hoping to get off of Lyrica, which caused my weight to balloon to over 300 (I used to be 200-220),\n\nI then focused on a skin condition I have and after a month long process, found out I have Hidradenitis Suppurativa, a condition that is rather depressing all by itself. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidradenitis_suppurativa). Because of its location (my neck), I have to treat it or it can turn into cancer, instantly spreading to my CNS and brain. I have had to start Humira, a drug that weakens your immune response in order to fight the H.S.\n\nAfter going thru all of this, today I found out my wife canceled my insurance without telling me, possibly hurting my meds and causing problems with my treatments. I had to call her and tell her 1/2 of my medical situation; I don't want to burden her with things that may make her life harder, and have become rather private about my life normally (I feel here I can just talk without being judged, so I am talking about it all now). It was productive and she is going to try to add me back on (we are still married), but I am in store for a fight with the insurance company so I can continue my treatments. She also told me of some problems she has now, and even though I know that she helped create those problems for herself, I feel sad that she is having to go thru them.\n\nI am starting to wonder why I even bother having a positive outlook anymore. I'm truly afraid I am going to die alone (as in single) and possibly before my parents (they are 70 this year). I feel like I have wasted my life, accomplishing nothing and bringing pain to all around me. I'm hoping for a better 2017, but I am not holding my breath.\n\nThank you for reading, I just needed to get this all out.",

After my primary talked about starting me on this new Med I got concerned and turned to the community for testimonies and different peoples experiences.

Nauseous 5 minutes after taking medication until I go to bed 14 hours later mood swings are off the charts I've been more depressed than I have been in the past 6 months and to add to it I am now light-headed and dizzy constantly.

My head is always killing me which again common side effect of antidepressants ssris you name it but this is weird. It seems like a disconnect between my brain my head and my body.. I don't know how to explain it other than foggy Maybe.. I've also noticed when I get a spike in Adrenaline,  and then settle back down it seems to hit me all at once.  and coming down from adrenaline on this is not a gentle slope into calmville, its an abrupt atom bomb of whatever chemical it may be and it bottoms me out so far that I've nearly collapsed while working twice. I mostly just wondering if this is a potential side-effect that may go away after chemical levels balanced out or build up, but this is unnatural and I'm not going to be able to stay on this medication any longer if this continues. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar. who knows maybe I'm just all sorts of fucked up and need something closer to a lobotomy. Thanks in advance, ",

And I know new year new me is BS but I'm really trying to get my shit together this year and be productive but some things always pull me down. Right now I've cut off every so called friend of mine who was close to me when I started '16 because I kind of hated how less people valued me and how much they used me. But for a start, I feel really good about cutting them off and moving forward even though that means I'm alone, I'm trying to use this time to start appreciating my life more and maybe meet new, less toxic, people. But with all the me time, I tend to think a lot. And most of the thoughts are negative. First off, I kind off hate my body and I can get really conscious about it around people and depressed when I think of it.  Starting from bottom, I am a bit knock kneed that makes my walk different, people keep telling me why I walk like that and the more they say the more conscious I get when I walk towards someone or a group. Having knock knees, I'm really uncomfortable when I wear any kinds of shorts or skinny pants since it's really visible then. After that, I have minor gynecomastia (puffy nipples) which makes my chest look less manly and fat. I can't even take off my shirt without getting uncomfortable af. Then I have a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa. I get lumps under my armpits and groin area . These can be painful and give a bad odour. The lumps can also drain pus and blood which can easily show up on my tshirts or undergarments. I have an overbite which makes my chin looks weak and the whole face unsymmetrical. I also have weird shaped fingers which actually don't hinder anything but people just notice and often make fun of 'em. Hell I cant even go bald if I want to because my head is not even round because how I slept as a baby. \nI have asthma as well and it just wont go away. I've to take my inhaler almost daily. \nYes I've been hitting gym and people have been complimenting the muscles I have put on but all the problems that I have, they're not fixable (some of them can be fixed by surgery but they're costly) and it kinda depresses me thinking why out of all people, I have all of these things. I've never been happy of my body and I dont know how to cope with it and since I dont have many people to talk to I cant help but think about it over and over again facing the mirror or the other time I'm thinking why people do me dirty and why I can't have strong social bonds. Also the fact that I have achieved nothing in my life so far and have been mediocre at everything I have done doesn't help as well.\nAll this usually puts me in a bad mood and outweighs all the positive thoughts that I try to bring.

        "Origin_reddit": "There are many things that bother me about myself, and those only seemed to have intensified and even multiplied over the past year. I would say all-in-all I will remember 2016 as the years my expectations dropped so low that it has surpassed the depths of cynicism to the point that I feel no different than a (barely) sentient robot. \n2016 is also the year I managed to grow disgusted with the world by the realization that everything in the modern world just seems no different than a movie set, with the plastic wrapping still on and showing. I came to these overwhelming realizations while I've been stoned, and by this virtue I don't know if I can consider these realizations out right depressive symptoms or just moments of supposed clarity in the state of inebreation. All I know is that these moments stick with me through my daily life and have tangibly affected how I feel and act. Maybe I really have been depressed and these high realizations just provided rationalization for why I feel this way, or maybe this is caused directly by the weed. This makes it difficult to know if it is appropriate to make posts on here, as 2016 incidentally was also the year I began smoking pot habitually from the years onset, a habit that I had only picked up towards the end of the previous year and which also strangely correlated with the onset with this feeling of disgust. \nThe year 2016 has pushed me into an uncomfortably cushy state of apathy wherein all my ambitions, desires and pleasures have fizzled away. Out of the many undesired changes I've experienced over the year, my apathy has kept me from remembering every detail that I've conceived, but one that really stuck out to me happened last night during an attempt to reconnect with a friend who was visiting my city. He travelled there with his girlfriend with whom he was spending most of his time, and so I barely to catch up with him as a buddy. Whenever he made a comment towards me, I would bypass responding sincerely and just try to go for a smug witty response. This habit has gotten worse over the year, and they're not even as impressive as they once were so it doesn't make people laugh as much to distract them from my impersonability (one of the symptoms I forgot to mention). And since I was resorting to this everytime I was addressed my friend and anyone else I had met there started realizing and ended up talking to me less. I had realized that when doing this it was mostly unintentional and it impeded on my ability to actually connect with these people. It was another red pill realization that I've unintentionally been avoiding personal connection for the past year, and instead I've just been abusing my tendency to replace a two way conversation with a smart-ass remark. Whenever I didn't poorly execute this i had absolutely nothing to say, and so I ended up staying to myself and observing everyone else have fun and enjoy each other's company, while I observed as if through a TV. At some point I started to question whether I was on the autism spectrum, something I hadn't considered before that. \nTo end this thought I just want to mention that I hope 2016 has been at worst an anomaly for what should otherwise be a good life for me, and what I mentioned here, though it may just be grazing on the surface of a myriad of issues I had, should be possible to backtrack from and return to my last point when I felt content. But this year I have repeated fond memories from earlier in my life and they felt bleaker and less visceral. I'm hoping that in 2017 I can gain my emotions, humor, joys, ambitions, and personality back because this apathy is torturous. \nI hope what I wrote here is coherent and fits well enough into this sub. Cheers and enjoy your year all\n",

I had an MRI and a CT.\n\nJust that alone was enough to ruin me (I knew that they were looking for tumors). \n\nBecause of the scans, we found a sphenoid sinus infection. I know this is a strong thing to say, but I wish it was a tumor; it would have been easier. \n\nThey gave me super strong antibiotics (without probiotics\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 :c). Basically, in short, the antibiotics fucked over my digestive system and created very fun trips to the potty. It lasted for a while. One complication over another.

I had treatment resistant depression (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen multiple psychotherapists and tried almost every type of cocktail they could throw at me). \n\nI continued finishing up my high school career with a clouded mind. I was depressed all the time (anxiety gone, thank god). I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t focus on anything. I had no energy to do anything.\n\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hop to the last two months.\n\nI asked for adderall to just help me focus on my school work so I could just keep moving on (until I figured out how I wanted to end things with myself).\n\nAdderall\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 ADHD\u00e2\u0080\u00a6? Nope! Adderall = Treatment resistant depression!\n\nNo joke. The adderall gave me energy. It gave me life. It helped my focus on what is ahead of me. It gave me the urge to go be me. I started to become -excited- about going out of my house and doing homework. \n\nThis is where I am now. \n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing homework. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking to people.

I stopped weighing myself about 2 months ago because it was getting even more depressing. I've read a few forums and have noticed that most people have experienced rapid weight gain with this medication, and no matter how hard they've worked- the weight wont budge. same issue here. I'm ready to ditch this medication because 1. I'm sick of dealing with the weight gain, going to the gym 3-6 times a week has done nothing. 2. it seems to increase my anxiety at times. 3.Its expensive(even with a coupon code and insurance.) The thing is- I'm VERY scared as I know that depression can become harder to treat over time. I tried probably about 8 medications before I found this one- I really thought there was no hope beforehand. I've stuck it out because obviously mental health is more important that weight gain, but the weight gain is causing me to obsess over what I eat/how often I workout. \n\nDoes anyone currently take viibryd?

I look in the mirror and feel absolutely disgusted with what I see. I dread waking up in the mornings as I can feel a new pimple or bump on my face that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there when I went to sleep. I have lost myself to acne completely, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruining my life. I take a shower, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want the mirror to show how inflamed and disgusting my face is. I just want a normal face color. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tired of browsing routines, regimes, diets, medications, products, birth controls because it all feels helpless. I just feel as though I am a lost cause. Acne isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the problem making me depressed, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my reaction to it. I can hardly remember a time when I felt confident without a full face of foundation. I feel as though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m fighting a losing battle everyday as I will take it and tell myself it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter, but the majority of the day it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all I think about. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become obsessed with it, because I want it to be gone. It makes me feel \u00e2\u0080\u009cunhealthy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and unattractive. I think when people see it, they think there is something wrong \u00e2\u0080\u0093 making me ugly.\n\n As much as I love my boyfriend, and I know how much he loves me, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but letting this skin disease and my mind tell me I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not worthy of him because of it. He should be with a girl who has a flawless face, who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to sleep with spot treatments on her face, and wakes up crying about a new cyst that formed overnight. He deserves to wake up to someone who can roll over and smile confidently at him knowing that she isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t covered in disgusting cysts and pimples. He should have a girlfriend that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have breakdowns about how I feel, and how disgusting I look; essentially having to talk me down all the time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a burden and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annoying, he should not have to deal with it. I don't want to tell him or anyone how I feel, because no one should have to deal with a depressed person; he should have a fun, outgoing person. (The person I was before acne took over my life) It makes me feel unworthy of having children, They would deserve a mother who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate the way she looks and feels depressed because of it. How could I possibly have children when I feel and look like this? I feel like my nephew deserves an aunt who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let these things affect her, a better aunt than I am. I even feel as though I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve my dog, she is so good and pure and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so depressed and self-hating. My dog makes me so happy, but I even feel unworthy of her love.  I am starting to hate myself, which I really had never done before. \n\nI know people say it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t define you, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m letting it define me. I know people they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about it, but they have to. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s become severe, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything currently to stop it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve sunken into a deeper depression every day, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m having a hard time enjoying myself with anything anymore because of how profoundly unhappy this makes me. I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something internal, but what more could I do. I feel as though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried everything except Accutane, which is going to happen at the end of this month due to the waiting period. I was told all hormonal birth control essentially balances your hormones, so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if the birth control I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been on for 5 years is hurting or helping; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had acne before starting it. I tried Spiro, which caused more and more breakouts for 8 weeks.. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been on antibiotics for 6 years or so, and they have finally stopped working. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to start Accutane, maybe it will give me a new lease on life. Or maybe I will be back where I started.

I am so unmotivated, not to mention tired. So damn tired. All the time. \n\nA lot of my worth is based on grades. When I was in school I would push myself too hard. After my anorexia calmed down a bit, so did my motivation to do schoolwork. Or anything. Without my eating disorder.\n\nEver since my eating disorder has been \"cured\" (and by that I mean calmed down to point where it's manageable enough that I don't have the constant need for exercise or racing thoughts over food and such) it's also had another impact: My motivation. I've noticed this ever since my anorexia really left me, my motivation is shot. I can't do college not because I don't have the mind or the resources but because I am simply not motivated enough to do anything. Before this, my anorexia and school work were tied together tightly and when I was in my funk but not so malnourished to function, my productivity would soar because it made me perfectionistic. Now, with that gone, I just can't find that motivation anymore.\n\nBut it doesn't just stop at school work. I am so tired lately. So incredibly tired. When I had my eating disorder I felt like I could lift mountains (until the wall hit of course) but now it's all I can do not to be asleep all of the time. It's why I don't go out much. Just getting out of my bed is harder than you can imagine. All I seem to ever want to do is sleep. I wake up and for and hour I'm all good, but after that it's a nap. And then 2 hours of wake and then I sleep the rest of the night. Luckily I don't have nightmares as I nap, only when I go for the long haul.\n\nWith the death of my anorexia (and to my shame I admit to trying to revive it several times) I have also lost my motivation and my spark it seems. Maybe it was because the only thing holding the haunting thoughts of trauma was my anorexia, and without that they are just free to take root in my mind and they very much do. The world is a much darker place. At least my anroexia had some sort of spark to it, as dark that flame was. Now I don't even have that.\n\nEverything is just dark now. I have no motivation. No will. The only thing I seem to be able to bring myself to do is nap to avoid my pain. I'm honestly not sure what to do. I killed a enemy only to find it was merely the tail of a larger and more poisonous snake. \n\nImagine seeing everything in back and white. That's pretty much how I see the world now. No more colors, no more fun shades. Just black and white. I'm more depressed now than I've ever been and no one is the wiser. I am so good at hiding it that no one sees anymore.",

She was a first for me. Had a great amazing relationship at first but eventually our differences became too great and my depression mixed with her whole nonesense and bs kinda led to our on and off thing and us ultimately breaking up in september for good. I was devastated and depressed as fuck for a long time. For some reason checked her ig a while back and saw she moved on fairly quick and she's happier which kind of kills me inside a bit but overall at this point I'm happy for her and hope she finds what she's looking for.\n\n-Almost didn't graduate cause I was too caught up in slacking off doing drugs and bumming out with \"friends\". But after a shit ton of detention (a grand total of 149 hours lol) I managed to get my shit together. My teacher Mrs. Nelson cried because of my actions and ultimately made me take school more seriously at the end and may just be the reason I graduated, Thank you Mrs. Nelson and I'm sorry i let my issues prevent us from having a really good relationship.\n\n-Got sued cause of a stupid accident by a scam artist, but my insurance company handled it so I guess it wasn't to bad just really stressful.\n\n-Tried killing myself a few times. One time I emptied a tank of gas on myself and almost lit myself on fire but the cops came and I was taken away to a psych ward. Met some crazy motherfuckers there but learned alot about myself. Once I got out of that place I needed a job after quiting my last one so I started pushing. That lasted a short while before I got my act together.\n\n-Started college and went for a month before dropping out. \n\n-Got arrested after my dad called the cops on me after I hit a wall with some plyers lol. He stretched the truth a shit ton Got charged with felonies and now I'm facing jail time. Been going to anger management and rehab and now I'm starting to face and handle issues better than I would in years past. \n\n-I was homeless for a while. This taught me the importance of money, homes, and life. Being out in 20 degree weather without much to your name can make you want to bust your ass off harder than you ever could have thought imaginable. \n\n-Tried to jump off a bridge a few weeks after my arrest. Got stopped by the cops. I was drunk and called my friends because Idk i wasn't good mentally. I was tired, sad, depressed and just overall unable to continue with life at the point I was in life. Lost alot if not all of my friends at the time. About 80 percent of them actually. We still say hello and talk from time to time but its not like it used to be. Can't say I blame them. \n\nNow moving into 2017 I just want to get back to living a life of normal day to day monotony with its perks here and there. I want to get a car and pursue my passion of automotive engineering and working on cars. I don't care about the bullshit as much and I'm just ready to move on.

Just a week or 2 ago I started feeling very aggravated with people who were struggling with life. I'd compare their problems to mine and think \"everyone is so weak Try living my life\" Now, my whole life I've been the most sensitive person I've ever met. I always felt proud of my unconditional, tireless compassion. But, my whole life I've always gotten my feelings hurt so easily and I spent wayyy to much time people pleasing and trying to get everyone to like me. As I said, lately I feel nothing for the less fortunate. If I notice say, someone being nasty at work to me, I observe it but give it zero other thoughts. I've been dating and I have no intentions for anything but sex. I have no close or bonding feelings with these men. So I actually like this feeling of self-reliance. To not be such a people pleaser has made my life a lot easier. What gets me nervous is my impulsiveness. I keep doing things to see if I'll get caught, or hurt or arrested. Like, I'm a waitress and a customer was slightly snappy with me. No big deal. I decided to spit in his drink so if he continued to be rude I could have a good laugh about it. 2 men I've slept with have girlfriends and to this day we still text/hookup and I could care less for the girl whose relationship I'm invading. I don't even try to rationalize this behavior. I just have no concern whatsoever about how others feel. I drive very fast, all the time. Recklessly and aggressively too. If I think I can definitely get away with it I'll steal and feel nothing, no guilt. If you read this and can't get past the \"sleeeping with taken men\" or are horrified I'd spit in food, I already know it's despicable, I just don't care.

I've had a lot of bad things happen to me and when I've sought help to deal with mental issues I've been told that in cases such as mine most people have either committed suicide, on heavy drugs or are in prison. I'll admit I've had my moments and I've done some crazy shit since I've been around 5 or 6 and I'm now 30. I am now on a heavy dose of antidepressants which I have realised does not stop you feeling depressed but helps you deal and manage it. It has definitely helped with my anxiety though. I've kind of thought that because I'm such an odd character and quite misunderstood that I would start finding ways to help myself and I've done this by excessively focusing on certain things. I've focussed on fitness and weight lifting I also enjoy gaming and streaming which has also helped with my anxiety. Don't get me wrong, there are days I wish I could clean the whole fucking house and not lay in bed wanting to destroy myself... they're are days where my mind and focus is a bit off and sometimes even way off but I can say these days it's a lot better than it used to be. It used to be waking up not knowing whether or not I was going to die or other people around were going to feel safe. Having been getting better with my anxiety I have now made new friends, talking does not bother me and I'm more relaxed I've even flirted with a girl which was nice. I do have another issue I would love to fix, I have a stutter which I've pretty much had forever. But you know what, I don't even care at all. Fuck it.\nMy advice to people in that state where they just want to die is, well think about this you're going to die eventually so may as well wait until it happens naturally or I guess unexpectedly. I know what you're saying, the pain of living is too much. I know. I've been through in order of age and events: hallucinations and hearing things along with nightmares from age 2 until about 11 then I was sexually abused, beaten by a drunk father almost weekly and I was bullied pretty much every day of my life until I finished school. My mother was abusive, her boyfriend was abusive, I lost my sister to mental illness she's not dead just lost. My son died (dog) I lost my job then my girlfriend of 9 years then my house then my mind my souls and my humanity. Getting everything back to stable was hard. I tried killing myself many times, well I planned it many times and I don't know how I never actually did it. My girlfriend at the time was also pushing me and provoking me knowing I was trying to kill myself. I can go into a lot more detail but it's a long story and there are many other shitty things I've gone through but you know what. Here I am! I'm alive and I've been through that and more so I feel that I win!! I conquered all that and I still smile, I laugh and I enjoy things. We're all bigger and better than the things that have hurt us, talk about things so that you can show it that it doesn't own you, that it doesn't hurt you and that it has no power! All the things you're afraid to do, do it! Unless it's kill yourself don't do that because you, each and everyone of you deserves to live no matter what you've done and what mistakes you've made!

Except he doesn't have romantic feelings towards me. Lovely, ain't it?\n\nAnyway, ever since the very first phrases uttered to each other, there was a connection. Heck, I felt that connection when I first laid eyes upon him. No, I'm not talking about love at first sight, but I am certain there was an excitement, an understanding, you know? And I'm pretty sure he felt that connection too.\n\nAnd that connection was ignited like a fire which fed off of the act of fooling, the act of making the sweet and the ripe believe it was eternal. Less poetically put, when he he started talking to me less and less, when his vibe held this sort of apathy, I was very much so disheartened and in complete disbelief. More accurately, I still am. \n\nAnd I blame myself. I blame myself because of my various mental illnesses, and my annoying, whiny and pathetic behaviour whilst he put so much, so so much into helping me out. He gave me advice, he stayed up all night to talk me out of suicide, he did everything in his power to convince me that I wasn't some useless loser. And he genuinely thought that. He genuinely cared. He genuinely thought I was an amazing human being. And frankly, if it weren't for him, there is a great chance that I'd be dead by now. Yes, okay, I've tried killing myself multiple times over the course of our friendship, however each and every time I failed, and holy hell was he glad I failed.\n\nI mean, that's obviously not the only thing we spoke about. Of course not. We have everything in common. Jesus, we even have the same favourite colours. I am not religious or spiritual or whatever, but this? This guy, this friendship, it's simply too much of a miracle for it to be over now. Cause, you know, we've drifted apart (for the record, he knows I'm totally into him, but that isn't what changed things).\n\nHonestly, I've never had friends\u00e2\u0080\u0094like, seriously, I've never had real friends\u00e2\u0080\u0094but this guy, and when somebody introduces you to something new like this? When somebody finally makes you feel like you matter? Yeah, that's pretty darn difficult to just let go of.\n\nMy problem is, we haven't really spoken about my \"issues\" in a while, and I'm seriously just one big mess. I tried to kill myself the other night, and though I don't think I plan on trying again any time soon, I am completely lost and I have no one. No one. Therapists and all that just don't work in my situation, and honestly, I just need him. As a friend. As someone who's there for me.\n\nExcept I don't want to annoy him. I don't want to be a burden. I don't want to make him feel bad, and any harsh feelings he may have towards me? Yeah, I deserve that, and I accept all of it. But I just don't know what to do. Would I be a complete and utter idiot if I texted him?",

I started yelling at people telling them to shut the fuck up because their voices were annoying. that sort of thing. but the thing that I ma the most concerned about is the snapchatting of the girls. I have a girlfriend. I love my girlfriend literally more than anything and it hurts me to know that there is a part of me that would do something like that. I don't know if I'm overreacting or if I'm just a piece of shit that should go die in hell. but this is really killing me and I don't know what to do. she has literally loved me so much and been there for me through everything in my life. and I have done this in return. I guess it technically doesn't count as cheating, but none the less it is still a really shitty thing for me to do. what the fuck should I do with myself now. is it really even my fault?

        "Origin_reddit": "I want to start by saying that I have a doctors appointment tomorrow to address my mental health. But I have so much going on in my head, and I feel a need to unload my feelings. \n\nTL/DR: Severe depression, feeling guilty towards my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 for dragging him down with me. Don't know what to do :'(\n\n\nI am having a really tough time. I have been depressed for many years. I have always been insecure about my body (am overweight), bullied at school, not many friends, but I have been OK for the most part with a caring family for support. But after a couple of years of infertility and after a miscarriage of twins four years ago I developed a more severe depression and anxiety. I have been on SSRIs since the diagnosis witch seem to lower the anxiety but had not done much for my depression.\n\nLately I have been dealing with intense stress at work coupled with a decision to start trying to get pregnant again. This seem to have put my feelings in overdrive. I have been experiencing extreme anxiety \"attacks\" with several hours of crying without being able to stop. \n\nI was recently asked to think about when I last felt happy. I know when it was, it was when I found out I was pregnant over four years ago. \nSince after the miscarriage I can't think of a single moment that I have felt truly happy. I can't even remember how that feels like. In know that no one can be happy all the time, that's not how life works. But even when stuff goes my way, like when I proposed to my boyfriend or when I got my doctoral degree, I've not been happy. Glad, yes, but not happy if that makes any sense. \n\nI feel empty, miserable, like a waste of space and resources. I feel like people are wasting time when they are with me. I feel guilty all the time for bringing people around me down with me, especially my fianc\u00c3\u00a9.   When he asks me how I feel, I most often lie and say I'm ok. And he knows that I'm lying since he knows me all to well. When i do tell him exactly how I feel, he becomes sad and helpless. He says that he wants me to be honest, but when I am he can't handle it. He tries to fix stuff, like giving me phone numbers to helplines, websites with information, etc, when all I need is a shoulder to cry on and someone to agree worth me that life sucks. And yes, I have told him that that is what I need, and he tries. But he feels so uncomfortable when I cry and just sits there miserable while I feel guilty. \n\nI really really love him and we have been together for almost 10 years, but I feel that I'm wasting his time by being with him. He says that he loves me and I believe him, but love isn't everything. What comfort is love when every day I make him feel miserable just because I can't feel happiness? I also have zero sex drive. He wants to have sex every day, but itv happens only about once a month. Kissing and touching makes me feel really uneasy, but I pretend to enjoy it. Mostly it's OK, but sometimes I feel violated afterwards. I haven't told him this, I can't do that to him. We have discussed going to couples/sex therapy but I really don't want to tell him the truth since I know how much he will be hurt by it. \n\nI really don't know what to do. My insurance doesn't cover a psychologist/psychiatrist only a counselor. I have been to therapy with that counselor several times before and she made me feel even worse and that my misery was my own fault since I was so negative. She was one of those just-people (\"just\" get over it / if you \"just\" think positive things will change / \"just\" stop feeling depressed).\n\nI don't really know what I want to achieve with this post. Just needed to vent a bit. I hope that my doctor has something that can help me tomorrow.\n\nIf anyone had read this far, thanks for \"listening\".\nHugs",

        "Origin_reddit": "So this happened a while ago and is pretty much in the past, but I went through some sort of drug induced psychosis or something. I don't know what happened but I went from half a year or so of doing nothing with my life and having no prospects, to utter ecstasy, in 45 minutes one night, the amount of time it takes for MDMA to kick in. I felt like I was the second coming of Jesus Christ, for a week, a month after, I don't know. Some sort of headspace where I thought I was the one with the ideas to save humanity. Depression to ectsasy in under an hour. I remember I had this thought \"repression of expression turns depression into aggression\", I'll get to why.\n\nBut shortly thereafter (in the days following the \"comedown\" of the MDMA but I didn't really come down, more like drug induced psychosis) I was having panic attacks and couldn't function and thought I was going to die sometimes for whatever reason. Just paranoia or whatever... very real paranoia, but just that, nothing more. It's sort of a blur looking back on it I don't remember the exact sequence of events. But eventually after ending up in the mental hospital emergency so many times they just said \"this time, you can't leave. You have 2 choices: voluntary or involuntary patient\". So I spent a night there... and that was it I didn't know how long I was going to be there. It gives a new perspective on life and how long it takes for you to start scoping out an escape route. Let's call it real life escape from Cidna mines in skyrim. It wasn't that bad though you know, comfortable beds, nice people, decent food. But there was an irony of me sitting across a table from a man scribbling \"BUZZ LIGHTYEAR\" in crayon all over a page and me scribbling circuit schematics for voltage dividers to try and explain to the nurses I was sane so they could let me out. I didn't need to plot an escape route though because I was released the next day. But for whatever reason, when I got home, this huge wave of depression hit me.... maybe it was just the rapid change of environment.... freedom, no freedom, freedom. What the hell am I supposed to do, that was the thought that came to my head... what does society want of me? To cure my diseased mind, or to put my unique mind to creative work? I didn't eat anything and just slept and then the next morning had some sort of panic attack or whatever and next thing I know I'm outside just screaming at nothing. I was hungry and thirsty and just wanted some fucking food and here are all these houses and I knocked on a door just to see if someone was there to help me but no. What a sick fucking society we live in, me with not enough water to get up over the hill (I was down in elevation maybe 100 feet, that's a big hill when you haven't eaten or drank anything and are depressed and don't have the energy to get up the hill). Yet here are dozens or maybe hundreds of houses all with water pipes in them and I can't have any. I was screaming \"GIVE ME SOME FUCKING WATER\" but of course no response. I finally just stood in the road and forced a guy in a truck to stop and I asked for his phone, and to prove to him I wasn't a thief I threw my shoe in his truck so that I'd be disadvantaged if I were to run away with his iphone. Just the fact that he gave me his waterbottle (the spontaneous social camaraderie) and the water got me up the first 50 feet or so back home. Then I just lied in the ditch because I didn't have the energy to get back up over the hill. A few cars drove by until a woman finally stopped, but (understandably looking back at it now) she drove by slowly with the doors locked and that she was of no real help (she offered some help but from a distance, not with the metaphorical open arms of the pickup truck guy) and considered me a criminal so I just yelled at her \"go the fuck to work\" or something really nasty and she drove off. But the fact that she had stopped at all gave me the energy... social comradery or whatever at least helped me find the energy to get back home.\n\nAnyways the point of all that was that I couldn't function after that MDMA roll. I can function now, at least. But all my life I've had this anxiety of not being able to express myself in public speaking. Which is ironic because I've played music on stage in front of so many people. But I just have this fear of expressing myself, and when the fear finally burst and I spoke my mind, I lost my freedom, they put me in a mental hospital. So you can't blame me that I'm not too keen to really speak out in front of people that much... at all. I'm a smart guy, I have an engineering degree, I could design and build a computer from scratch given enough time and resources, but I just can't do the social thing. I mean in school or university they don't mind so much the creative or different ways of thinking but the mental hospital, society in general, considered me diseased. I don't relate to people that much. I haven't been on a date for almost a decade... and even back in highschool I never really connected with the girl I dated. I don't know if I did it to myself or if I'm a byproduct of the north american k-12 \"education\" system.\n\nI just need to be able to relate to people. I can't do that and it's slowly killing me. I don't know what to do. I'm happy, but depression isn't happiness or sadness and although I've been given the same result, \"mildly/not depressed\", by different doctors, there is disorder there somewhere and I don't know how to turn it into just normal people order.",
