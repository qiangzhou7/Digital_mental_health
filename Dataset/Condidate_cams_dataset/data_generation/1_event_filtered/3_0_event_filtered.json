Last night I had the worst vomit dream yet about my brother vomiting and it was so traumatic that it is really sticking with me today, I couldn't shake the horrible feelings. I found out after I woke up that he is actually sick and has been vomiting. But I have to go to an orchestra thing with him and my family tonight. I was obviously worried about it and my mom got upset about it and told me not to ruin the family's day. I really didn't know what to do because I had been on the edge of crying all day. I feel like my family thinks I am selfish for\u00c2\u00a0 expressing my anxiety about this and I feel shame. At the concert it was fine and I was coping. But after the concert, my brother said he felt sick and thaf made me really anxious. I kept walking so I was away from him, preferably ahead. We went down a bunch of stairs and my anxiety grew. We went in an open area and I was so terrified that I would see him do the thing that I started to tear up. By the time we got outside I was crying silently to myself. The whole way to the car I was behind everybody so nobody knew I was crying harder and harder thinking about what I could do to avoid getting in a car with him, but thinking that my parents would get mad and think I'm ridiculous. When we got there we were about to get in an elevator and I was hyperventilating to the point that they looked. They went up the elevator and Mystica came with me while I almost collapsed on the stairwell. I literally was gasping so much I couldn't breathe. My mom came down the stairs and asked me if this was because I thought Michael would vom. I said yes. She said I need to pull my act together, that she doesn't want me to ruin their night,\u00c2\u00a0 she wanted it to be a happy night. She told me that he hasn't vomited yet so I shouldn't be like this. She said I need to pull it together. This was all in a raised voice and I could tell she was mad. \n\nThis hurt me and invalidated me so, so much. I stared blankly the ride home and then I texted her pouring my heart out about how hurt I am. She still didn't really seem to care. \n\nI'm honestly a little bit surprised because I didn't think it was possible to feel so fucking isolated. I didn't think she would do something this bad. I left and slept at somebody else's house. I feel so horrible and worthless.\n\nAlso posted in rbn",

TMS has been the only thing to work for me, but its efficacy might be fleeting and insurance doesn't approve maintenance. I had a late response to the initial TMS series and they denied me for 10 more sessions; I wrote them a fairly scathing appeal letter and ended up winning; I used to be a writer at least in mind. I never had any accolades but I liked what I wrote and wrote a lot. So I let them have it in the letter and got the 10 extra sessions but everything is still uncertain long term.\n\nSo now my doctor drops the bomb that after this, ECT is pretty much where we go from here if the TMS doesn't hold. I'm 25, and I'm worried both about destroying my brain with treatment as well as allowing this disorder to keep me from really doing or acheiving anything in what will amount to a short, unnecessarily painful life. \n\nIs there another place people go from here? Do you just get real into Buddhism or stoicism or some shit and white-knuckle it? I always feel like there's something I have to be missing, and yet... \n\nI almost feel bad relating my story at this stage, as I'm pretty sure I'm doing all the things one is supposed to do, and yet recovery feels as remote as ever. Even with ECT it's like, what's the fucking point, probably fry my brain for a 60% chance at remission, that may not hold either. In fact, some of the studies I'm reading say that I may even be less likely to experience remission from ECT based on my absent response to medications as well as the length of my episode. \n\nI thought I didn't have much to say but I guess I did.

Wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sad, but I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happy either. Something like a zombie? Did some research...

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been competitive all my life, and nothing has been working for me these past days. Used to play video games, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty good at them, now I suck, and I do play regularly, I just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play well. I like to do BMX... I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m having troubles doing tricks I normally do... I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting very frustrated and I honestly think of jumping out of my balcony... But, sadly, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kill myself... So, again, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know! Oh man...\n\n I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been smoking cannabis these past months, tried it once and, well, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have friends, I mean, I consider them as friends but when your friends has depression, has been in a 72-hour watch, and other bunch of stuff, you should be worried right? Not them... Sad, sad, sad... (For me). But yeah, again, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the cannabis is making me go crazy just because I smoke only before going to sleep and I just take about 5 hits from a one-hitter I have, which I would say is about, maybe like, 0.2g each time I hit it? Maybe even less actually, but yeah, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the amount.\n\nOh man, this is getting really long, looks like a story haha... But yeah, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m bored, nothing seems to be fun anymore, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like doing anything, but I feel like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wasting my time, which feels bad... \n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how I feel, I think... So, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know... I guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to pay $40 to my psychiatrist to get my medicine again so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get suicidal thoughts again and I actually kill myself...

But life finds a way to hurt me anyways.\n\nWe hadn't talked in a while, and it made me feel like he was done with me. It sucked, but I knew it was going to happen eventually. Conveniently at this point, my ex hits me up. We start talking about how we're doing and politics (usually not good but we both enjoy talking about it), and then I noticed that he was getting....flirty?\n\nEventually he asked me if I wanted to be friends with benefits. Stupidly, I agreed, fully knowing that I still had strong feelings for him and never wanted him to break up with me in the first place. A couple days later (yesterday), we planned to meet up. The time came and went, and eventually I figured out that he went on first date with someone and was starting a relationship. That really hurt, and now I'm a mess. The whole year, I've been struggling with severe depression and anxiety, and now I get to know that I was so close to to getting him back but he's with someone else now.\n\nThe whole ordeal made me realize again that love is shit, and without love, life is shit. I can't move on from my ex, and even if I could, there's nobody else for me to move to. Except the guy that I hooked up with, *who also happens to be friends with my ex.* I hit him up last night anyways, because I'm so depressed that I don't even care. \n\nLife in general is terrible too.

My grades in school are terrible because I've missed weeks of it.

I want to live, and succeed, and be in a happy relationship with someone that loves me. But I don't think I can. I'm too broken.

I spent days thinking about it. How it is going to affect me. My days are precious. And I did nothing with them. I was so scared that I will lose them, I wasted them myself.\n\nI lost all my desires, dreams and interests. I had some hobbies that would make me feel fulfilled, no matter how I felt. I stopped doing them. I realized that things are not going to get better. I should stop trying.\n\nI started to hurt myself. I singed my fingertips. I whipped myself with a belt. I hit myself. I scratched myself. Because I am a bad person. I am unable to change how I feel, how my life goes, or how I think. I am powerless. I have no ability to make a difference.\n\nI am not suicidal. There is only one \u00e2\u0080\u009cthing\u00e2\u0080\u009d that can push me to it. I am prepared to do it painlessly. Unless this \u00e2\u0080\u009cthing\u00e2\u0080\u009d happens, I am not going to do it. I just hope that I will be able to do it, when the time comes.\n\nSo, it got worse this year. Its going to get even worse, I can bet on it. I failed my family. I failed at my life. I failed myself. I totally screwed up. I am responsible for everthing I did, and mostly, everything I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do.",
        "Event": "...\n\nThe main event in this passage is the individual's failure in their classes, their admission of depression and gender dysphoria, and their realization of powerlessness in changing their life circumstances. The passage also mentions the individual's lack of friends, their start of therapy, and their self-harming behaviors. These events are unambiguously bad from the individual's point of view, as they describe feelings of failure, sadness, and helplessness."
