        "Origin_reddit": "Hey everyone, I'm Jake and I'm 23 years old. I'm already started to give on my life now since September and i don't care about my life because its shitty, i have 2 speech impediments, no girls talk go me in school or anywhere, etc. I have so much anxiety and depression that Im losing my mind lately, plus I'm not eating enough and sleeping enough too because i don't feel like eating alot because i feel so upset at just everything in my life. I'm never happy anymore at all and i don't feel like living at times now too because of my problems while other peoples have fun in college, have friends and get married in a few years and have kids ,etc. My cousin just got engaged and most of my cousins are in relationships. I have a Speech Impediment called Verbal Apraxia with Stuttering which i had my whole life since i was born . i only had one relationship for almost 3 years in the past. I have been very depressed lately because i don't have a girlfriend like my twin brother and some cousins and friends that i have. i have good social skills because my nick name is the mayor Jake everywhere i go because i know and talk to everyone but i never talk to girls due to problems listed in this post.\n\nI have some social anxiety too which makes me super scared to talk to girls because of my Verbal Apraxia with the stutter and it makes me very depressed. As i type this I'm having alot of anxiety and I'm about have a panic/anxiety attack too, when i have anxiety i have irrational thoughts like people are out to get me and other things like that . i feel like no girls will like me or give me a chance because of it if i approach them in real life because i can't even say my name correctly. when i talk, it sounds like a moderate deaf person and i hate it so much all of my life. Also i used tinder which my twin brother met his girlfriend on and have no luck even after many dates with different girls, now i am getting more depressed to the point of crying and not going out of the house too at times. My family is not the greatest at times too.I live with my mom and grandmother who makes everyone crazy which includes me. Every girl i talk to on tinder stop talking to me within a few replies too so i don't have idea what to do now too like what am i doing wrong? but my friend said i suck talking to girls too so im trying to improve that right now.\n\nLately I'm thinking I'm ugly too which i kinda believe that i am ugly because no girls like me while my family and other people says I'm not ugly. also I'm in community college so I'm missing the college experience of staying on campus making friends and meeting girls like everyone else is at my age because of my grades and possibly future degree in funeral directing. I am at home doing the online program for funeral directing while  All my cousins and my brother and everyone at my age  went away to college and im home missing out on everything when you stay at college like meeting girls and parties Also i live at home too that doesn't help me in meeting girls unlike everyone at college campuses. Im too scared to approach any girls because of my speech problems because I'm afraid of them not understanding me. i just can't do it due to anxiety because of my speech impediments and afraid of getting rejected. Also some of my anxiety is from school too because I'm very behind in my classes as of today because I have no motivation to do it because of how i feel sick almost all the time from all of my anxiety and depression too. Also due to all of this, i just got a new gym membership to go with my guy friends and i used it a couple times then i stopped going with them because i feel like my speech impediments make me awkward around girls and people . all my life i felt like people say things to pretend so i think they understand me sometimes. I only have 3-10 male friends while every other guy have female friends and stuff at my age. I don't know where to start or what to do at this point in time because i tried Tinder and that didn't worked for me. Plus when i message girls on tinder, they almost never respond back. i can talk to guys easily and other people easily but not attractive girls at all , let alone approaching girl to get their numbers.i can see myself being forever alone because of my speech impediments.Also i have been in speech therapy too for a long time when i was little and I'm not in it now. So i need help and advice right now from my fellow Redditors Thanks for your help and advice everyone !\n\ntl;dr:i have Verbal Apraxia with stuttering which are speech impediments and i can't talk to girls due to the fear of not being understood and rejected of my speech impediments. Im scared of being forever alone while my friends and everyone is married and have kids in a few years while I'm not. To be honest, I'm almost 100% sure most girls will not date me because of my speech impediments and have a family. . What should i do at this point in time? Also should i try to approach and talk to girls that i like ? Because i want to over come this fear of talking to girls because i think they will not like me of my speech impediment.\n\nEdit- I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting  regular therapy weekly  now, also I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m seeing the same therapist that I saw years ago when I was younger too and im going to the gym too now. I made a  tinder account too this week but almost every girl that i talk to stops talking to me or never respond to my first message. Im not in speech class right now i had it when i was little tho.",

        "Origin_reddit": "I got out of the army last year three months before I turned twenty eight and moved back into my mom and stepdads place because my credit was still ruined and I was still in debt from eight years earlier... because of my mom and stepdad. It's a long story and I won't go into detail but they stole money from me when I was twenty and it forced me into what seems to have been a perpetual road of nonstop failure and deep, deep, *deep* self loathing.\n\nI injured myself in the army and got a nice chunk of permanent disability, making me set for the rest of my life. This is nice and all, but this wasn't my goal. I wanted to do my job in the army but no one ever elevated me. I wasn't hated either. That's the part I don't get. It seemed like everyone liked me but no one ever put even one extra second of effort to elevate me further. I watched everyone else get ahead as my physical state deteriorated and after four years, realizing I was going nowhere and was never going to get the qualifications to do my job on the inside or outside, opted for the medboard option.\n\nWhen I got out I moved back home with my mom, stepdad, stepbrother and blood brother in a five bedroom prefab home because my credit still wasn't fixed, and what I saw enraged me. \n\nMy mother had put on two hundred pounds, already weighing a sturdy four hundred. She'd sat in the same spot watching TV for the entire time I was in the army. My mom no longer abused me emotionally or physically but now she was doing this to my autistic stepbrother. She berated him daily. Even worse is that my stepdad was too wimpy to stop it and forked my mom over thousands upon thousands of dollars so she could buy fake little business licenses and crap off Amazon for the sole purpose of making sure no one else got my stepdads money... except for my brother.\n\nI love my brother. He is my most prized person and we grew up together, but my mom has simply paid for him to sit on his ass and smoke weed, turning his mediocre hobby into a job with a whopping thirty thousand dollar \"loan\". I've never been treated this way. Since I was fourteen it was \"get a job\" while my brother was allowed to sit around and smoke weed while I busted my ass during all the best years of my life.\n\nWe lived out on eighty six acres and my mom wanted the land clear cut for some sort of farming operation, one of her hair brained schemes. It takes lots of time, money and machinery to clear cut eight six acres. She expected me to do it for free, by hand and with an axe. I said no.\n\nAt some point I began buying my own tools and storing them in the shed and would use them on and off again. Slowly I noticed they'd simply disappear. One day, when my mom thought I was gone, I watched her waddle into the shed, take a handful of my tools, walk them into the woods and toss them somewhere I could never find them. She'd toss my axes into the truck with the trash pile and take them to the dumpster. Nothing had changed. She was still hell bent on destroying my property and due to my credit I couldn't even get my own place. After three or four months of drinking, I broke and went to rehab.\n\nI wound up moving in with my girlfriend. I won't badmouth her but we drifted apart during the army and she never got me on the lease, instead inviting a random girl to live with us who couldn't pay rent. Because I had no say, and things had fallen apart between us, it ended after a month and a half.\n\nI moved back to a friend's uncle's place and for three months I got my finances in order. During this time I met up with a girl I'd known since middle school and had always had a crush on. Things went great. Our first date was awesome but she made it clear she was celibate and wanted to get married before having sex. It was annoying but like I said, I'd known her since middle school.\n\nWe dated for three months. Not like we were going out as girlfriend and boyfriend but going places and having deep discussions about our future lives together. Ya know, all that sappy relationship stuff.\n\nWe finally went on our final date and she invited her friend. The date was awesome... until her friend got drunk. We went camping for three days and on day three I assume her friend saw the attention she was paying to me and cut a nice wedge between us and berated me for hours. It wasn't anything I couldn't handle but sometime around midnight I fucking exploded after she made up another story and called me out for something that I wasn't even lying about. That night I asked the girl I was dating if this was worth pursuing and she crawled out of our tent and into her friends. She later claimed she was drunk and thought I made a move on her but it was worse than that, she'd had a boyfriend the entire time and was intentionally friend zoning me and hadnt expected me to find out if this was worth my time. \n\nIt gets worse than that though, there was absolutely nothing between us, at least on her end. She hadn't been attracted to me one single bit. Even worse is that during our falling out discussion, she wouldn't even admit she had a boyfriend, I had to find out later through friends and hearsay. The last time I spoke to her she just cut me off for admitting how I felt and being upset but she never blocked or deleted me from Facebook. She just saw my messages for a month and would occasionally reply with a snippy one word answer until I blew up and forced her to block me. THIS finally seems to have broken me. A month or two earlier she talked me into getting an apartment on a year lease so we could have somewhere to hang out when she was in my neck of the woods, so now I'm fucking stuck with an apartment until August, in a part of town I moved to because I could find a free place to stay until I was able to get back on my feet, where I only know a small handful of people.\n\nI am using my GI bill to go back to college and maybe I'll find some purpose and a woman to live my life with, but everyone my age is married with two kids and a house. I missed out on the entirety of my twenties, and blew it with a girl I'd known since the sixth grade and felt totally fucking berated. I haven't bothered to find anyone or make friends or even to make eye contact with anyone lately and have relapsed multiple times.\n\nI just want to take my meager army money and buy land and be a fucking hermit and live the rest of my life wondering about what could have been if I'd been raised better by loving and hard working parents, or had opportunity, or had someone say \"you're next in line for success and great things\", but none of that happened. I don't think it's because I'm hated, because people genuinely seem to like me, but that's it. I'm just that guy with the pearly smile who's fun to talk to but nothing more. \n\nOn a final note, I will say this. I got out of the army and I remembered how social I was *before* I joined, but once I got out I saw how everyone had moved on or had burned out. I'm in purgatory. Im somewhere between success and failure. I'll never hit rock bottom because my body gave out under the strain of army life, but I'll never make more than I work for in an entrepreneurial manner. I've thought about opening a bar or something like that but I've been denied a home loan and VA business loan so many times that it's now affecting my credit despite only having one tiny and insignificant debt left.\n\nIt doesn't matter I guess. I'm boring, I'm bored and I don't know what to do and the world has moved on from when I was young.\n\n",

        "Origin_reddit": "Just a quick rant about my problems to make me feel better and get some weight off my chest. Each paragraph is sorta it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own thing.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m almost 16, in high school, getting over losing a girl I love(d) because she cheated on me a while back and was really toxic even though we were crazy for each other. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m actually doing okay though. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not my worst problem.\n\nI have it really good. My family makes really good money, super stable job, nice little cozy home, never moved, happily married parents that I have great relationships with and I get privileges like being born a tall white male in the suburbs/country in the best country in the world but yet I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not happy.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sad, I just feel numb to things. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a feeling like my brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s active and happy. Is this what depression is? I feel dry and stale. \n\nMy health is bad. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a type 1 diabetic; ever since I was 6 and ever since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been a teen it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been really out of control. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fucking with me mentally and the constant high blood sugar does physical things to mess with your mood too. \n\nBecause of my diabetes I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do the only thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever been good and passionate about, be a marine. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entirely off the table. It feels really hard having this sometimes. But I think about how I could have cancer or HIV while starving in Africa as an orphan with no education and it just makes me feel like a pussy. Pride and integrity are important to me but I really do just feel shitty all the time and feeling bad just makes me feel bad so I feel worse and so on.\n\nI feel so numb and like, hyper aware and lacking of those good chemicals in your brain. My whole life I always wanted to go hunting. The first time I ever killed a deer it was a great experience on paper, but I felt like I was acting being happy the whole time. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel much excitement and it broke my heart. I wanted to be out there with everything in me, but it was like I had played this level of the game over and over, even though it was entirely new and \u00e2\u0080\u009cexciting\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nI hate school. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where I get all of my social interaction, sure, but in reality it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a horrible attempt to teach on a massive scale, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a holocaust for young mental health. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m smart but I feel like my brain cut me off 100 steps up a 1,000 step mountain. I feel unmotivated and limited to what I know I can do. I used to be a really good student and this year I literally just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything even though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in the upper level classes.\n\nAnd even if I did great in school, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it for? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel interested in doing much else. \n\nI would never hurt myself in anyway. But I really do wonder what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m living for sometimes; even though other times I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fathom how I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d feel that way, and I force myself to be positive and like myself and feel a little better.\n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like myself. My hair is really bad and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fix it really, I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna go bald, I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like my face much, I hate complaining about this this shit and feeling bad in my situation.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in a low-key state of depression for the majority of the last 3 years. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been going to therapy now for 3 months. However, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if things are going the way they should be as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never done it before, and have nothing to compare it to. \n\n\n**Here are some \u00e2\u0080\u009cpros\u00e2\u0080\u009d  about my therapist:** \n\n\n- Specializes in my issues\n\n- Good listener\n\n- Empathetic \n\n- Takes my insurance so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty affordable \n\n- I am comfortable being vulnerable around her and telling her everything\n\n\n**Here are some things I find questionable. Please help me decide if this is normal:**\n\n\n- Only took notes during the first session (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if she takes notes after the session or not)\n\n- No homework or things to work on. When I asked if there was something more I could do about a certain thought pattern, she said I was already doing it just by going to therapy. End of story. \n\n- No direction or check-ins. I do 99% of the talking. She never directs the conversation or checks-in about stuff we have talked about. She waits for me to initiate all talk. If I spent the entire session talking about some silly tv show I saw, she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t direct it back towards anything. \n\n- Her responses to almost everything are \u00e2\u0080\u009chow do you feel as you are saying that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are a lot of layers to your pain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n\n- Not sure that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m making progress towards anything. It all just feels like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m unburdening to a third-party. I don't feel better after my sessions and I don't feel like I've gotten any better. \n\n- I have twice asked her if I should be on antidepressants. Both times, she seemed reluctant to even talk about it. We left off both times with me being no more clear about whether or not I should pursue this, how to go about getting a prescription (can she do it? Do I go to my family doctor? Either way, she never gave me my options or how to move forward)\n\n\nIf this is normal to therapy, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to continue going. What I would like to avoid is getting trapped with someone who may hold me back from actually making concrete progressions towards being healthy and whole. Should I stick it out?",

        "Origin_reddit": "HI there everyone. This is extremly long, I want to finally ~wake up~ , so, if you don't have free time, don't read. Sorry If I let my emotions to take over my writing.\n\n This is the first time I open myself like this, to a bigger community or a larger group. First of all, I'm 15, young, ain't I. I don't think age matters, anyway. My life so far was and is pretty rought. My mother died when I was 7, because of cancer. Even though I was young, I wasn't stupid. I knew what happen when I was called at my school ~office~ or whatever it is called to be told. \n\nOne of my friends mom adopted us. By us, I mean my brother and my sister. She is one of the best and most powerfull pearsons I know. She already had a daughter and was divorced. We had to move, 2 times, because of some issues with the rent. She and fought and is fighting, in a way or another for us. She is the reason why me and my sister have a roof above our heads right now. She took a part of an old building, raised it from nothing, without anyone helping her, just a women, alone. She renovated and \u00e2\u0080\u009dupgraded\u00e2\u0080\u009d the interior of the house. \n\nYears and years later, my brother left us. Just because he's ~different~ and has another sexual orientation discussion starter to occur. He left, found someone who he loves, and, lives happily, in a way or another. I'm happy that he found his way, but I could never understand why he left.\n\nI was a pretty mediocre and am, talentless and a bother. My way of being it's like, helping the others, and disappearing. After I know the pearson is good, I want to fade, but I can't, because they attach.\n\nMy stepmother family is pretty fucked up in the head. One has drinking problems, and her mother and her sister. Oh god, they are the worst. None shows their real face, only after a while, that's one leason I learned after so many years. We had our updown in family, but everything is their fault, for jabing into our lives.\n\nHere, in my country, and in my city, the salary isn't worth anything. That's why she went in another country, actually found someone, found the PERFECT job for her, but, with that the problems came.\n\nSince she is far and her job can't allow it, she can come two or three times home. I don't have a problem with it, I know how much she was struggeling with this dumb life in this country, and I'm happy she can finally start her life, it's never late.\n\nBut I'm alone, with my sister. She's an adult, she can take care of me, that's not the problem here. She had some job problems, was thrown out, and because of that, money issues came in. Money, after money, after money. That isn't such a big issue, or that's what anyone would think. Apparently it is, in this dammed family, they are all judging, throwing her, disrespecting her and ~spitting~ on her.\n\nShe was on the merge of suicide so many times, but she can't do such thing, because I'm still in her life. She still fights for me, otherwise she would be gone a long time ago. Since we went throught a lot, we aren't the type to show our affection, our love, and like all the people, make mistakes. We love our stepmother, she did what many can't do, but we feel like we are thrash, and want to die, both of us.\n\nSince my stepmother is far, and I don't know why this is happening, she can't control her life alone, not anymore. She let's other pearsons, like her mom, and the idiot that she found, but unfourtunately loves, dig in, they are making the decision for her, and that hurts. We love her, but we are being constantly ~stabbed~, because of her blindness.\n\nWhatever we say is put against us, we are being gossiped by them, thrown on the window, disrespected, literally thrashed by her family. That hurts, and I'm on the merge of totally giving up. We've been fighting, resisting, but it hurts like hell.\n\nMy sister found her love, but, because of the fact that he is a gypsy, they all judge her. She doesn't know what to do anymore, in order to reconcile both sides, she can't do anything, because nothing is enough or good for them, they are a bunch of incompetents. Judging her over and over, when that men helped us more than they did. That's just stupidity. \n\nWe've been hurt, over and over. Now I understand why our brother left, because of this family.\n\nAfter I grew up, I found myself in a depression. An extremely severe one. I can't get out, I found amazing people but, because of the doings of my own hands, I lost them. I lost a her that she helped me for an entire year, because I'm a liar and lazy pearson. I want help but I don't want them to get in, because they will feel bad, my situation will completely ruin their happiness. So I found myself sad, depressed, talentless. The only things I have left are my dogs, which I love the most on this planet. From three, I was left with two, and god knows when, with one. I feel like the power I have left is with my dogs, but, when they will be gone same I will. I want to disappear, completely. That was I will end my suffering and make this family realize what the hell they did wrong the whole time. My stepmother is great, did amazing things, but one thing she didn't gave us was love and affection.\n\nI'm spending nights playing, school isn't going that great, I have another way of thinking and I really don't bother with it. I just, can't. Playing and spending my days on PC, even though I don't want to. I want to have a talent, to grow up and save everyone that in my situation, to grow up as an artist, singer, anything. I just want a talent.\n\nI drew a long time ago, lost my talent because of the lack of motivation and depression. Started guitar alone, but don't have the motivation because I feel like I'm a failure. \n\nA long story, and I'm thanking you all who reached this part, you are amazing just by spending time reading. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I'm depressed, I'm thinking of things a 15 shouldn't, thinking of suicide nowadays, because of the situation we are in, thinking so much, being dead inside and having a huge gap in my hearth because of the things I lost so far, and because I can't do anything proper.\n\nI need help, what should I do in order to change myself, I'm just at the begging of life and thinking of ending it. I hate this world and everything around it, because I was raised with hatred and ~fights~. I want help, to cure my deep depression, to regain my happiness, to see the world colorfull again, I want to be normal, again. What can I do, nothing motivates me and nothing makes me happy anymore.

My mother told me that my father started a charity for boys without fathers, but other than that, I know very little about him. Four years ago, my mother and stepfather moved overseas, and the transition has been difficult for me. I haven't made any friends in four years, and I feel like I'm stuck in a purgatory where nothing is changing. I have dreams and goals, but it feels like I'm chipping away at a granite wall with a plastic spoon. I've been feeling alone for so long, and I wonder why this is happening to me."

After years this guy from Mexico left and  I spent years alone, literally crying until falling asleep. That left in me some serious trust issues. Years later in 2016 I started talking to a guy from Texas. He had gone through a lot of stuff and I felt like I could help him. Things were going right, we were friends and started a long distance relationship I loved. The problem is that he stated changing and we were arguing a lot. My trust issues didn't help either. I became too demanding and he kept ignoring me. One day I broke up with him and I was an idiot thinking he would try to get me back but he didn't. I found out he had someone else. Another long distance relationship. It killed me. I thought he was gone, but during all 2017 he has been typing, sending messages and telling me that he would leave her at some point and would come back because he loves me. He told me he doesn't love her and tried to break up with her (that was true, but she said she was going to kill herself if he leaves her) so he stayed with her. A week ago I got so mad at him for his decision of staying with her that I insulted him. I called him a coward, an idiot and much more. My temper doesn't help much either.\nHe replied and said he didn't care about me anymore and he blocked me everywhere. I can't sleep. I can't eat, I can't live. \n\nI think I fucked up and lost the only guy who ever showed some interest in me. I'm dumb, kind of nerd, not pretty and stupid. I don't think I'll get anyone else in probably years since I only had two relationships (both long distance ones) and I had to wait like 3 years for the next one to happen. (the last one I had) \nI think I am doomed to die alone. \nI don't know what to do, I feel so much anxiety. I want to stop feeling things, I'm a failure at these things. I'm horrible with relationships and I wish there was a way for me not to feel anything anymore.\n\nPlease help.",

I know that isn't really a HORRIBLE thing at all. But I am starting to wonder why?\n\nStory: The only guy I have attracted to a possible relationship has severe depression and general anxieties disorder. He is kind of a shut-in and plays videogames and does drugs when he is not working. That's the extent of his life that I am aware of. I have known him for a few years and at some points durng those years were very close and talked about getting into a serious relationship. At some points, he called me his girlfriend but we never have been REALLY at that point. He used to tell me that he cared about me a lot. He would go through depressive phases and disappear sometimes. When he came back it was always the same. \"I'm sorry, I'm not a good person, I'm bad at relationships, I want to die, etc\".\n\nI still try to get through to him even now. He ignores me or tries to set up a hook-up date and then pretty much just blows me off anyway.\n\nI'm starting to wonder less about him and more about me. My friends say that he is not capable of a relationship and it is not a reflection of my worth that he is not receprocating my feelings. But at the same time... if this is all I can get, is this a reflection of me? Am I depressed because I am alone... or am I alone because I am depressed?\n\nWill getting into a relationship with someone make me feel any better? I used to think that I could help him by showering him with my affection and attention. I used to think that if he did this to me, I would feel better and everything would be solved.\n\nFor some reason, I think this is foolish now. Maybe it's just growing through the attachment and coming out from the other side in hindsight. Maybe it's just getting tired of him not liking me back. I don't know.\n\nI feel like there is a connection between being alone and being depressed though. I feel like if I would have some thing or someone to support me, I would be more likely to overcome or be motivated to overcome other things. I know that's weak. I just get exhausted and lonely sometimes. Going through all my life without anyone has really been difficult but I'm not trying to whine about it, please don't think that.",

I'm also an introvert and generally cant stand to be around people other than a select few. I Went to a therapist early in highschool who said i had some form of depression, but my parents never really followed through getting any medication for me (i dont think they really believe depression is a problem). I've been in a pretty huge slump since I've been out of high school (almost 4 years) compounded by the fact that just recently my best friend decided he would check out early. I want to get some professional help before things get any worse. I have a job and insurance but not a lot of money. I am not suicidal (i guess i was up until recently and i found out how bad being on the other end feels), but now that this is no longer an option i feel like i am just trapped in a 100 foot hole with no way out. \n\nReally i am posting because i have questions i am hoping to have answered by anyone with experience on the subject.\n\n1. Is a general practice doctor usually someone who can prescribe anti depressants? Im not sure my insurance would cover any sort of mental health doctor.(i generally hate doctors and pharmaceuticals and avoid both at all costs, hopefully until now as i cant really see any other resolution)\n2. How do i know if they(drugs) would even help? Any particular  \"feelings\" they prevent? \n3. Do they help with anxiety or would that be something else? \n4. Do they affect you physically? (Weight gain/loss, energy, ect.)\n5. Generally speaking are any of the pharmaceuticals i might be prescribed expensive?\n\nThanks for any help/advice anyon can give in advance.",
