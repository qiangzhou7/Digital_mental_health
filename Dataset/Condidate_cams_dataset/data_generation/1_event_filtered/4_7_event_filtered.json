I lost a friend to suicide. I had my closest friends move away. I had physical health issues to deal with. I had some troubles at work.\n\nThe worst part of the year was that my dog got sick twice, and the second time was cancer. Like a lot of people, my dog has helped me through some really tough times. She's been the only reason I've gotten out of bed some days. I've had her for over 11 years. Six months ago she had some aggressive and expensive surgery to treat the cancer and it (seemingly) worked. She recovered well and is back to being her old high-energy self. The last couple of months I have felt so much better because she has too. \n\nLast week I found a lump on the site of her surgery. I'm waiting to see a specialist, but I'm devastated. If the cancer has returned I don't know if it will be treatable this time. I don't know if I can afford more surgery.\n\nI'm not stupid - my dog is 11, and I know realistically she will only be around another couple of years at best. But I can't imagine life without her, especially now. I don't know how to handle her being sick again and potentially suffering. I can't handle her dying. I can't handle her being gone.\n\nIf you're not a pet person, you probably don't understand this, but for 11 years I've always had at least one thing that loved me and relied on me. She's kept me going and I don't know what to do without her. Thanks for listening.\n\n**TL;DR: My dog may have cancer again, and I'm afraid of losing her.**\n",

I have been suffering with anxiety and depression since the age of 14/15 due to my upbringing and circumstances.\n\nI was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness which meant at school I always felt different to everyone else and as such have kept my personal life extremely private. Even though I decided to leave the religion at the age of 16, a large number of my family remain in this religion. I've always therefore struggled to live a 'normal' life, and my small circle of friends still have no idea of my past.\n\nDue to this, relationships with girls especially and making new friends is something I always avoid due to fear of them and everyone else finding out about me. Because of this, I've never had a girlfriend. When I keep to myself and get my head down and focus on university work I can usually put the anxiety to one side, however recently I met a girl who I like and she likes me and it's causing me great anxiety and depression again. She's always telling me about how close she is with her family and not only can I not relate, it annoys me I can't be the same.\n\nI think it has a lot to do with me caring about what people think of me too much as I'm aware of people who left the religion in similar circumstance and have normal relationships and seem to not care.\n\nI like this girl yet she's so opposite to me as she's really outgoing and how normal she is makes me scared she'll only think I'm weird when she gets to know me.\n\nAny words of advice or help would be extremely appreciated.

What keeps you going?\n\nI've had depression for awhile mainly caused by an unstable family/home and never addressing my issues or feelings. One day when I was younger everything just hit me at once, a family member I was close to just up and left, this left me feeling alone, I also met a girl which at the time I couldn't fully comprehend what I felt for her but she was messed up to from family and all I could really do was cry about my life because I never had anyone I could really talk to about what caused me pain. Needlessly to say this relationship didn't last long and damaged me more so I found myself sitting in the floor with a knife thinking if I'm alone and I can't connect to people and I can't process this pain how can I stay here, how do I keep living. Something snapped and I decided I wouldn't kill myself, that I had to live my life regardless because I risked endding my life before happyness came, before seeing what life could bring, i also told myself i was stronger then this so i made the mistake of burying everything and deciding I wouldn't take shot anymore. This worked out for awhile, I found new confidence in myself, I stood up to anyone or anything I needed to, for awhile I felt invincible untouchable. It wasn't until these last few years that everything I buried came back up. It broke me, it zapped me of all my confidence and strength. I never learned to express my feelings and I always had a sense that my problems if expressed to other people were a burden so in turn I died emotionally, I became a poison to my life and the people around me, I damaged good relationships in my life. Being emotionally dead wasn't a fix either so eventually my mind started to wake parts of me up and it made me flip out, it was like waking up from a nightmare where I saw all the damage I did but unlike a nightmare this was reality. I broke down because I saw myself losing everything that held meaning to me in life and in a fit of pain I hurt myself trying to hide from it all and further damaged my relationship. \n\nRight now I feel like I'm in between my life working out or coming crashing down. I've been dealing with my past issues and I do feel like I'm better mentally then I've been but my emotions still get the best of me. I'm forced on 1 person I want to spend my life with, trying to repair damages, trying to find a way to explain how and what I've felt. I have other points in my life that need attention, ones that if I deal with will bring me closer to this person but I can't not fouces on them, I just want them to see me, understand what I felt, understand it was hard on my too.\n\nIdk where I was going here. I just kinda needed to talk. I guess my point as to what I asked in the beginning is I'm still here living and I don't plan on stopping because I feel like I can achieve what I want but not if I take my life. Life is going to be hard, harder for some them other's but I'm still going to try for happiness and I'm still going to try to make life happy for the one I love whom I hurt emotionally without meaning to.",

I was 15 and my family moved to another country, but it wasn't what I expected which led me to stay isolated in my apartment for three years. I was too paranoid the people I met at school would see me active on social media and ask me why I haven't been in school. Which also meant I didn't contact my friends back home for a while.\n\nWhen I visited home it was during the summer and we could only afford to stay two weeks. I tried to do as much as I could in those two weeks which made everything feel rushed.\n\nIn 2016, my last year before moving back home, I was in a long distance relationship, it was going great in the beginning but towards the end I could tell something was different and it led me to become obsessive with his activity on social media. We broke up before I moved back home but I found out my friend, who introduced me to my ex, and him liked each other. It did hurt since he was my first boyfriend and I felt worthless and I didn't deserve love because this was the outcome. I also knew they hung out but she was my best friend and I trusted both of them 100%. I have never felt betrayal like that. I wanted support from my friend group but they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there for me so I lost them as well. \n\nI am friends with another girl who is separate from that friend group and she was all I had when I moved back.

        "Origin_reddit": "I experienced intimidation at school, and my story will undoubtedly be different from what you have read in the past.\n\nBecause I am psychopathic by definition - diagnosed by few psychiatrists - what I have learned from that encounter will help you see intimidation from a different perspective.\n\n\n**The story**\n\nWhen I was younger - in high school - two famous guys from the volleyball team tried to bully me.\n\nThey would laugh at anything I would do, and others followed;  most are easily influenced because of a lack of critical ability, after all.\n\nThey cursed, started rumors, and shouted insults to make sure the others and I heard them.\n\n\n**Indifference**\n\nI have learned a lot from these episodes. I have watched them go through all kind of emotions, and it was easy to see they needed to fill a void.\n\nMy utter and complete indifference made it worse.  I did not give the attention they were seeking so severely. I witnessed their behaviors toward me without any concerns; I was only interested in learning more about human interactions.\n\nYou can learn from every experience in your life, good or bad, only if you take the time - and the required energy - to interpret why the reasons the experiences happened.\n\n\n**The crowd**\n\nAt that time, I expected they would go further with their intimidation - after all, they had not gotten what they wanted; and they did not disappoint.\n\nThe larger of the two guys got physical - he had to - words were useless. From my perspective, and judging from his facial expression, it seemed like he pushed me as hard as he possibly could. Then, my back hit the wall, and I fell on the floor right after.\n\nWhat followed was phenomenal. Everyone that I could see from my vantage point stopped talking. They had that dramatic look in their eyes; they were eager to see how I would react.\n\nFantastic, because it was a real representation of how limited most humans are. What happened is unquestionably unacceptable in the eyes of the majority of people - and yet - only one person, out of almost fifty, reacted with what looked like genuine empathy.\n\nThe rest did not move an inch to help. They watched, anxiously awaiting what was going to happen next. Some out of fear, but the vast majority were just thrilled to witness a possible act of violence.\n\n\n**You are in control**\n\nWhat I have learned, and still find useful to this day, is that nearly everyone you encounter in your life is not worth your time, and even less so, your energy. Even if they're not, you need to be respectful with your entourage: it's a necessity to thrive in any society.\n\nYou are in control of who you accept in your inner circle; thus you have the courtesy of choosing wisely. From my experience, only one out of fifty should be considered investing your time with.\n\nIt was out of the question I would react the way they expected it - I had to see how they would respond if I didn't do anything. Thus, I got back on my feet and continued on my journey.\n\nThey didn't cross the line because I still had to learn. I required a code to make sure I could live socially - it is the interpretation of these experiences that would allow me to build its foundations.\n\nThat one person who stood out of the group, and who later explained everything to the authorities - made me realize she was worth investing the time.\n\n\n**You are the strong one**\n\nIf you are bullied, feel intimidated, and/or rejected: it is imperative you realize, right now and from now on, you are the strong one. The ones who intimidate you would never be able to withstand - even for a second - what you are going through. \n\nThey are weak, and unlike you, they don't have the strength to control their most elementary feelings. It is fundamental to understand that very few people have the tenacity you possess. You have an attribute that makes everything achievable: self-control.\n\nWhen you think about it, is there anything else you can control entirely besides yourself?\n\n\n**The necessity to talk to someone**\n\nIt is useless to let these bullies intimidate you one more time. Use your strength, which very few possess, but you do. Remember to talk to someone about it. Take the time to look around you - it is mathematical - there is one person out of 50 in your entourage who will be worth your time, who is willing to listen to what you have to say, and who is going to stand up for you.\nIt is your responsibility to give that opportunity to that person. Use your strength to talk to someone and share how you feel; you will be surprised how much it will help.\n\nYou also have to acknowledge you are not alone. Others feel the same and are enduring the same situation. While all situations are different, inevitably, the solutions are all alike.\n\nTo those who intimidate, you are weak, and your actions are only a representation of your lack of confidence in yourself and a clear illustration of how low your self-esteem is.\n\nOne good start for you to display real strength - let's face it, you need it - is to apologize. If you still believe that intimidating others is a display of power, try the opposite.\n\n\n**We want to hear your story**\n\nYou are all welcome, whoever and wherever you are, to share how you feel and what's on your mind with all of us, in a place where respect is fundamental.",
        "Event": "Intimidation at school\n\nThe main event in the passage is the intimidation experienced by the narrator at school, specifically from two famous volleyball players who tried to bully him. They would laugh at anything he did, start rumors, and shout insults to make sure others heard them. The narrator remained indifferent, which made their behavior worse, and they even got physical. The passage highlights the limited empathy of most people, as only one person reacted with genuine empathy, while the rest watched anxiously awaiting what would happen next. The narrator learned that nearly everyone in their life is not worth their time and energy, and they need to be respectful of their entourage. They also realized that they are the strong one and have the self-control to overcome these situations. The passage concludes by inviting readers to share their stories and experiences."

        "Origin_reddit": "Hi there. \n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a 24 yo lady newly married to my best friend. We rent a nice house, have two great dogs (and a grumpy cat), and I have a steady job that I normally find challenging and rewarding. \n\nBut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still depressed. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember a time when I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. \n\nMy father abused me as a child and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been raped as an adult (before I met my husband). Lately (as in within the last three months), I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been experiencing really weird symptoms that are hard to explain. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like my mind is disassociated from my body and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a robot. I see the world through a pane of dirty glass and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not really in control of anything. I see things that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there (but I realize isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reality), like my hands seeming smaller than usual. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve googled those symptoms and, surprisingly, depersonalization disorder popped up.\n\nI also have a lot of anxiety (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been previously diagnosed with GAD), and have panic attacks probably three or so times a week. \n\nI often (daily) have flashbacks of being abused and raped, and am easily triggered by hearing certain words or seeing certain items. I relive those horrors at least once a day. \n\nMy husband knows of my past and is very supportive. I feel so guilty when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not able to get out of bed on my days off of work to do house chores and such, even though he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make me feel that way. He says it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay, but he wants me to see a therapist because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard for him to see me like this. \n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m working on seeing a therapist, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very anxious about it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a few therapists before and I feel like they either A) didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help or B) helped, but talking about my issues brought up a lot of bad memories I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d forgotten/blocked out. Reliving those memories made me so depressed last year, I was admitted to a psychiatric ward, which was so awful. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be in a place like that again. \n\nLately, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been making huge mistakes at work because of my inability to focus. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying really hard every day, but I still end up making mistakes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very frustrating when I see all my effort and hard work isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough.\n\nI guess I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m asking. I called a therapist today (after a lot of googling to find one I think I would like) and got her voicemail, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave one. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just so scared to tell someone these symptoms I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been experiencing because they sound so crazy to me. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want anyone to think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m crazy. And I definitely don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be sent back to a psych ward. \n\n\n(I originally posted this in r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide, and one commenter suggested I post this here.)\n",

I rarely feel happy anymore, the only emotion I really feel is anger or hatred for anyone and anything. Everything annoys me. Earlier today I was talking with my mom and when she started saying things that pissed me off without even thinking I slammed the box of pills I was fiddling with onto the table, sending them everywhere and stormed off. I immediately felt regret for what I did but I can't just take it back. I don't enjoy hanging out or talking to people anymore, I very rarely have passion for anything anymore and I don't understand why or how I even became this way. This isn't how people are supposed to live, how do I fix my view on the world? I have absolutely no idea what to do, I just feel like I'm in such a dark place mentally. Relationships of any kind are difficult for me because I just don't care about people enough to maintain those relationships. Sorry this is just kind of an outpour of whatever I'm thinking at the time but I'm just genuinely pretty lost as to what I can do to improve my mental state. I don't know what I'm looking to get out of this post, I guess just some advice? Anything really. I'm 20/male &amp; unemployed, I don't know how to drive and my mom can't really teach me so I feel pretty stuck in that regard, I also owe ~$400 to my credit card company because of some debts I couldn't pay when I quit my job at a movie theater for another job (that I already had a start date for) and then something went wrong in their systems and I was out of a job, haven't been able to find one since so that's probably part of why I might feel this way, subconsciously? I also gained a lot of weight in the past few months after losing a lot, from 210lb to almost 160 and I'm pretty sure i'm back to where I started, I want to join the Air Force for a few years to help pay for college but first I need to get fit again which is pretty daunting considering all the weight I just put back on and my unhealthy eating habits. \n\nAnyway, that's about it. It feels a little better to type it all out but I would appreciate some kind of advice. Throwaway account but I'll be around for the next 2-3 days. Thanks for reading.",

I found some things - On the left, is a note my mum mailed to me at the start of my first year of Uni as she knows how homesick I was, even though it had only been about 2 weeks since I left home. \n\nOn the right, is a cute birthday card that my little brother made for me. (Spider-Dan is another nickname of mine) in it, he thanks me for being the best brother he could have and drew a picture of himself and I fighting against a monster whilst I was super saiyan.\n\nSeeing these two items instantly made me burst into tears. I just sat here crying, feeling completely broken. Guilty of the way I feel and how I want to die, knowing I have family that loves me. I don't want to be a disappointment to my mum, I want to make her proud of me. I don't want my sister and little brother to lose their big brother. I want to look out for them both and be there for them.\n\nIt can be so hard to carry on. Everyday I wake up not wanting to be alive, but I don't show it. I don't care about myself anymore. However, maybe things such as this are a reason to at least try.\n\n",

She has these times where it seems that shes just so out of it that she can't do anything and she wont talk to me about it. She just kind of shuts me and everything else off but I know shes trying her damnedest. She tells me she has an old soul and that as we are together longer it'll only get worse. (Like I'll see more and how bad it gets.) I want to make her feel so much better. I try to give her my EVERYTHING and I try to make it through the day and show her that the next day will be better but it just gets worse it seems like. I hate the place that shes in and I can't change it for the life of me. I know you can't get rid of depression and she'll always be with it. Shes told me that but I still want to try my everything in any way I can to make everyday a better one. I just need advice on how to do all of this because sometimes I feel like I'm not worthy of making her feel better. I feel like everything I do amounts to nothing. Please I need everyone's advice on how I can just make the best of what I can....\n\nThank you...",

I have some online friends who are really supportive and tell me I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m smart, when I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really feel like it. I fail in basic stuff alot.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been dealing with chronic depression since forever pretty much. My depression often manifests itself in anger.

But he never came, never said happy new year, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apologize or anything so I just flipped out on him and I never want to talk to him again.\n\n\nSometimes I think he was my only friend because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only person That is a big enough piece of shit to want to hang out with me. Like misery needs company sort of thing. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m such a depressing loser piece of shit I only attract the biggest pieces of shit.
