I'd also like to say my family knows about this and I'm currently in CBT which has helped in some ways, but not in others. I'm also on an antidepressant.\n\n\nI'm 28. My *entire* life I was always happy, laid back, protective, loved animals and especially dogs with all my soul, loved my spouse of 8 years and naturally looked past their flaws, never felt violent or unstable in the slightest. I was connected to everything I cared about. I spent a few years frustrated and depressed but I still felt love, kindness and interest.\n\n\n\n6 months ago I had a total and complete mental breakdown. I experienced a violent thought followed by 10 minutes of visceral fear, confusion and fury. I was scared I'd hurt my dog. I didn't want my spouse to come home incase I hurt them. for 2 months I had the belief I was secretly some kind of murderer and was afraid to be around either of them alone. Since then I've retained a resentment and almost hatred toward my spouse and I feel insanely uncomfortable around dogs, and my dog specifically. I harbor this belief that I am evil and I spend all day either furious, repulsed or annoyed by my spouse. I also feel completely disconnected from everything I loved: music, hiking, landscapes, art, books, sci-fi and fantasy.. it all feels distant and alien and something I shouldn't be engaging in. I spent 4 months crying every day and now cry maybe twice a week, just because I'm so keenly aware this isn't who I am and I hate it. \n\n\n\nI was known for being almost too laid back before this. No problems with anxiety or anger. I am so confused and hurt and all day my chest is tight and my mind is racing trying to find answers. I almost have a fantasy of leaving my spouse and today I had a horrible thought of 'if they died I might be way better off'. I tried to brush it off as a silly escapism thought (as in CBT) but the very existence of it made me want to kill myself. I actually felt like I wanted it. 7 months ago I couldn't imagine a life without my family, now I feel like a prisoner to them, and they're so damn supportive, because my spouse knows this isn't me. I'm just scared it is now.\n\n\nI've been told it's OCD, but I think a lot of it may be depression as well. I don't know what to do really. I mean I know I should wait and get better before making any decisions about anything, but I feel so angry and stressed and I'm starting to snap and be really snarky to my spouse. It's driving me insane.\n\n\n\nCan anyone help with some advice, or similar situations, or anything? This is kind of just a cry for help of any kind whatsoever. I'm getting better at dealing with it but it still feels like a railroad spike in my chest and a demon in my head. I feel so bad and evil, and it feels like any good thing I do is forced because I feel like doing the opposite. It's hell.",

        "Origin_reddit": " Hello everyone, \n\nFor the past year and a half, I've struggled with an intense internal conflict. According to my psychologist, I may suffer from a mild to moderate depression. To this day I am prone to loneliness, sleeping problems, feelings of worthlessness, laziness and my intrusive thoughts from my OCD that would never shut up. Earlier this year it was worse, with thoughts of suicide constantly plaguing my mind (probably due to my obsessive thoughts). \n\nThis time last year (Around the beginning of the New Year) I promised myself that I would seek help for what it was that was bothering me. This time last year, I felt hope that I would overcome this. Today though, I don't feel that way. Today, I feel like I am doomed to be alone for the rest of my life, that I am not going to amount to anything, that I will not connect with other human beings as intimiately and deeply as I want to. And that is when I am seeking help. \n\nThe most prominent feeling I have felt throughout this year and a half old depression (it's possibly older than that) is loneliness. Sometimes it feels like an invisible brick wall cuts me off from everyone else, preventing me from forming true bonds with anyone. I feel like my family and friends do not care about my mental health; my family is aware of it but barely checks up on me. My brother (who is overseas) told me that he would check up on me and asked my sister to do so regularly as well. That was five months ago, and my brother has only checked on me a couple of times and my sister has not asked me how I am doing once. Also, my mum had to get a referall to continue my sessions with the psychologist. We got the referral about a month ago and she has yet to give it to the psychologist because she says 'she keeps forgetting' and that I should be the one to remind her. That hit me hard, because it made me feel like my mental health was not her top priority. My parents also say that I can come to them with any issue, but I know that isn't true, because when I do my dad always puts on a judgemental tone which makes me feel like dirt. Also, when my brother came to my parents for help, he ended up getting kicked out of the house. \n\nAs for my 'friends', I question the validity of our friendships. Just today I tried to talk to one friend about how I felt today, and it flew right over his head, and he talked about what he was doing instead. That especially hurt me, because it made me feel that maybe no one in this world wants to hear my problems. With my other friends, I want to tell them so badly about what has happened to me (not one of them knows I have depression and OCD) but I find it so hard to bring up in casual conversation, and I think some of them might be to immature to take it seriosly. I also constantly think about what the basis of my friendships consist of, whether they are deep or superficial. I feel most of them are the latter, which makes me question if I truly even have any friends. \n\nI guess what brings me here are these questions: how do I cope with all this loneliness and anguish when I feel so alienated and estranged from everyone around me? How do I connect with anyone who I feel isn't willing to truly get to know me? Am I doomed to this depression and loneliness for the rest of my life? Will I never connect with anyone in an intimate way where I can express my inner emotions without fear of judgement, because I feel I cannot even do that with my family.",

        "Origin_reddit": "Hey guys, long story short I've had a long history of depression/anxiety and I was prescribed Effexor towards the first half of the year (around April I think). Initially it lifted my mood, but very quickly it began to take a toll on me. I found that I felt completely disconnected from my actions, like I was a stranger inside my own body, and more worryingly I lost the ability to really feel any emotion. I've had to imitate behaviours and emotions even though I am not feeling them in order to still seem like I'm functioning. The only real feelings I've had as of late have been bouts of anger and a habit of splurging on stuff I don't need and overeating which I never really did before.\n\nMy doctors have been extremely unhelpful and I made the decision two months ago to slowly taper off my dosage. I was on 75mg a day, and I began by opening the cases of the pills (there are six small capsules within a plastic shell) and removing one of the capsules, over time ramping it up to only 3 capsules a day, the equivalent of 37.5mg. One day I decided enough was enough. I cannot be held prisoner with this fucking drug anymore, it's too much for me and I long to feel SOMETHING again beyond anger. I quit cold turkey 8 days ago and it's been rough, really rough.\n\nI'm getting a TINY BIT of feeling again. Over Christmas I didn't really feel much at all, but I felt a bit happy the day after Christmas spending time with my family. My sex drive is beginning to return and my dick suddenly works again. \n\nAs for the withdrawal effects, it's been rough as fuck.  I get \"brain zaps\" which is very common for people coming off Efexxor. It's like a sudden jolt in my consciousness and happens anywhere between 20-100 times in an hour. I can handle that though. I'm lethargic and it's hard to move my hands properly. I'm experiencing a lot of hot flushes and high temperature. I'm sweating balls when I sleep and during the day.\n\nWorst of all is I'm getting bouts of extreme anger. Over time I've become a much more chilled person, but this anger I'm feeling does not feel like me at all. I'm convinced it's withdrawal effects. I get so mad I want to scream at full volume and smash everything around me. I've never consistently felt like this even in the past when I struggled with anger. The slightest thing infuriates me and I'm overreacting to everything.\n\nMy family have no idea how long I've been struggling. I made the decision a while ago not to bring it up because it only makes things worse. They made it very clear they want to help and share my issues but when I've spoken to them about how I feel in the past it has scared them and they have been over-protective. I choose not to rely on anybody else and I don't have anyone to share how I feel with so I felt like I wanted to make a post here.\n\nI have become distant with all my friends and family. I felt such a disconnect with life in general at the start of the year that nothing really feels real anymore. I don't care about anything, I don't want to make an effort with anybody and I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about how I feel. I don't feel like anyone would understand. I feel like I'm not meant to be here and that I'm defective and people can just sense it when they're with me. Everything seems to superficial and pointless and nothing gives me joy anymore. I have vivid fantasies of pushing everyone I know away and living alone in solitude and never having to contact them again, starting life over. Even though I'm close to my family and have some very good friends, it never feels like enough and I've lost a lot of close friends recently by cutting them out of my life because they were toxic people.\n\nI feel hazy, I'm sleeping bad and it's hard to focus, but I'm 8 days in and no matter how bad it gets I'm staying off these torturous drugs. Think long and hard if Effexor is really for you. It has become a prison for me and online research has shown me that it's the same for others. I am determined to beat the dependence, but I worry about how long I'm going to feel like this. I can handle a few months, but what if it never goes away? I feel incredibly alone in all of this. \n\nThis is a bit of a trainwreck of a post but it feels a little better to put how I feel into some semi-cohesive manner. Has anyone else gone cold turkey and made it? How long did it take?",
