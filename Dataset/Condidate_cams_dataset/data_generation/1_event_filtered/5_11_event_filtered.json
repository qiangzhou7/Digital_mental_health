I was randomly googling things like \"how to survive when you're depressed\" and one of the common pieces of advice is to be kind to yourself and accept that you're not operating at your normal capacity.\n\nThe problem is, if I'm operating only on 20% capacity, what do I do when my life is demanding at least 60%. I have so many things I haven't done. I missed a doctor's appointment yesterday, I ignored a friend's invitation today, my credit card is due to be paid in a week and even though I have the money to pay it, I just haven't yet. My fridge is completely empty aside from food that is two weeks bad. I haven't showered in 5 days. I have a massive laundry pile to do.\n\nNone of these things are unmanageable on their own, but there's just so much that I feel I can't do. How can I even begin to get help when I'm this bad? It feels like I've already reached my limit just refilling my water and going to bed.\n\nHow do I survive, in practice, when it's taking all my willpower to simply not kill myself?

I had an uncle that killed himself years back and my 32 year old cousin killed him self last year.

        "Origin_reddit": "We are all meaningless and worthless. Our existence as a human species has destroyed the earth to an extent so far that there is no hope for repair. With everyone being greedy, selfish, and weak no one can stand for themselves. People can not be trusted with any information. There is always a way to extract that information. In the worlds history people have been tortured until they release precious information. Some information is serious and some not as important. This means that humans do not have the ability to safely store information. We are animals. We make choices free willingly. No one can be trusted because reality proves humans are sensitive weak fucks. Humans can be broken easily. Nothing but false confidence and pride allows us to live. There is no protection, no certainty or hope that cannot be broken. Im just a spectator. I could put down myself but that would be pointless. If im not feeling any satisfaction in this world then what is the point to keep living. I do not feel any attachment or love, or care. There is no satisfaction or any position energy or feelings that i feel as i wake up. Each day is a forced challenge. The world is not free. Out minds are psychologically abused and used by massive corporations. We do not have free thought. All our actions are watched and criticized. Media skews our perception of reality in the world. There is absolutely no freedom anywhere. Everyone who i look at is just following the schedule a forced schedule and routine that they are just programmed not to think any differently. Everything can change. There is no god. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to put any energy into thinking about what is real and what is not. The only thing i seek is a satisfaction in life. Where something makes me feel comfortable and good or happy. This is not short term fake and false bullshit like drugs. Anyone with a working mind will realize those are bad for a number of reasons. But some people just go with what others say. Fuck that. Im not going to make people realize they are all programed and controlled robots. We are forced to do so many things. There is only one thing you can do if you realize everything is pointless and meaningless that is hope. You can hope for something but with out assurance that anything can disappear and be lost what is there to hope for. Your hope can be broken by everything around you. We are animals. Selfish greedy fucking animals. But we have our consciousness that separates us slightly from everything else in this world. But we are still animals. Which means physically we feel fear, sadness, pleasure, and lots of other feelings. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter where we have come from we will all die. Why does it matter what we do if we will all die. Again what stops us from doing what we want can also be caused by religion. If we believe our actions affect us in another world then we will submit and obey. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if there is a god but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care. If people understood that exact bit of words and realized that. Earth would be a complete shit show. But we have been dominated and controlled because most of us think we can not change some things about the world. Physically that is. We are fearful of physical pain and torment because those physical feelings stop us from being free. Because pain hurts. Humans are traped no one is free. This is why i want to be alone and talk to no one. Very few can understand and realize we are trapped. The way to controll humans is fear and pain but most importantly just not knowing the future and having uncertainty. No one is fearless or painless. Saying you have no feelings is a delusion of your mind. Every single living human has some sort of emotion that stops them from doing what they want. A simple example is our human physical feeling of embarrassment. Or shyness. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to tel you what shyness is but embarrassing events are hard to understand why we become embarrassed. Some people become embarrassed by presenting in front of the class. Because our human bodys and minds feel embarrassment. Our body and mind are different although our body has an incrediblly strong indescribable connection to your mind. People are very dumb. Of course usain bolt is on steroids. They say the olyimpics are tested ok great. There are ways to cheat tests. At that high of a level of compitition anyone will do anything for a short term satisfaction. This satisfaction is either from the world or the persons mind. Sometimes both. Achievements in life are only in this life. They might make your mind feel good but its not eternal. Nothing is eternal. Everlasting. Everything can be broken. Safety is a false feeling. There is no real true safety. Unless i do not feel these warm feelings that I should. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. Everything is cold, bitter, sad, depressing and i do not feel any satisfaction. Its depression or myself realizing that everything is a delusion and nothing is real. Im not crazy i just understand more than you. Unless my false sense of reality is also skewed to the point of no return. To where i feel no eternal warmth. There is no love that i feel. The only thing that separates my diluted mind is my physical body. I feel emotions like you. Pain, sad, happy, angry, depressed. These are what stops us from being free. The indescribable connection of our minds from our bodys. Our human bodys are what makes us want to live. Our human body is an animal. It controls our mind and our thoughts. We are all sick. Our body is irrational but our mind is rational. But our body will mess with our mind making humans the complex beings that we are. Again i feel no love or satisfaction. Everything i say and do is all from my body. Not my mind. My body controls my mind most of the time. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like i can control my body in a way where it will not affect my mind. Since we have a conciousness we are not gods. Since i have no satisfaction I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to live but my physical body affects my mind from ending it all. Maybe there is another realm, world, hell or heaven. Who knows. The uncertainty controlls us. We have freedom to sone dregree. Yes our free choices are the smallest most insignificant thing in this world. There is no attachment to anything. Why do i know all of this and feel that way i do. I do not know. I might be missing something. I am missing something its most likely comfort. Not physical comfort but the uncertainty in my mind. Uncertainty is why humans are fearing the future. Its cold dark and what is reality. What is a conciousness. There is no such thing as safety. Uncertainty and us as humans not knowing what the future holds alows religion to control us. Religion is based and controls you with out your thought because you are uncertain. No one knows the future thats what makes churches and religion wealthy and powerful. Because if you make someone hope for something good in the future then you can control them. Our unknowingness allows people to control us. Someone who we think is in authority can control us because of our uncertainty so they tell us what we want to hear. But this is a tool to control the masses. I know so much i have so much to share but my body stops me sometimes. Why do we follow what people say? Because the world has punishments for you. If you did not feel anything physically you would rule this fucking earth. Simple as that. People stop being so dumb. Many people are sheep they just follow. And it is not possible not to follow. Im loosing my thought process as my body physically drifts off to rest",
