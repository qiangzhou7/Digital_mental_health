I get worse whenever I see porn, since I chastise myself for not having the genetics to date and bang hot women. I asked an aesthetics forum to rate pictures of me, they said 6-7, but it means almost nothing to me if it's not 9.\n\nThe one thing that keeps me from killing myself is thinking about how I could change my life around. I'm currently selling my stuff so I can afford lasik, then braces to fix my teeth. I'd also love to get limb lengthening on my legs by 3\" to make me about 6', but I have a small head and worry that I won't look good. I've done research on how to apply for gene therapy clinical trials and other radical reconstruction. I honestly don't care what the complications would be, I'm THAT unhappy. I think about suicide already, and I would end it if it happened to not work out.\n\nI wasted a lot of time before realizing this \"my way or bust\" mindset, and I hope anyone younger than me can take away that you'll regret not solving your problems sooner if you don't start now. The depression only compounds on itself as you grow older. I'm 30, and I'm willing to put my DNA in a blender.",

Did shitty things like cruising at public toilets/groping at busses,etc.. since 2013 at various times.\nEven through all these confusions, I am quite social now with all the fellow interns. \nI never shared any of my problems because, no body gives a shit and they might take it as a way to tease me. I hate small talk/sharing of facts/any talk about movies.I usually am silent if I went for a group dinner. I find it pretty hard to talk in group,also, I do not remember such facts about which country has X resources/so on.\n\n*Career*:Finished Masters in Engineering with above avg GPA. Got a job through campus.Now, doing a research Internship and planning for PhD.\n**About current work:**In my present internship, I was given a development project which I was not interested at all.Every others were given some interesting research work.I could have finished mine earlier and switched to something else, but I am dragging the work for so longgggggg. In every weekly meeting, I just lie to the Prof. that I did something something.All the other interns have detailed slides of their past week's work, but I write it in 1 or 2 lines. So, I am the worst performing guy in the Lab(I have the potential, but the project is dull and in this period, I came to a good understanding of my behavior,sexuality,addictions and so on.Now I am on track-No hookups,no Fap,no addiction to porn).I was also addicted to chess--played for 4-5 hours straight daily while others were seriously working on their projects.\n\n**What happened:** This New Year, I was not invited for a jungle camping which every other lab mates went.Around 10+ people went.I used to talk with everyone whenever I meet.Even I asked a guy, the day before what was his plan for New year, he said he is just gonna stay in room. Few days back, they didn't invite me for a dinner too.\n\nI do not know what has caused them to ignore me. Most of them are from well-to-do family, but mine is still kind of unstable with debts.So, I never eat costlier outside food and wear same clothes again and again and never go out for watching movies/party. I am in the city for 4 years and have been to a few places every now and then alone and am not interested to go out nowadays.I went for a cycle ride 2 weeks back with one other girl intern without informing anyone.\n\n**How I felt that day?**\nI was pretty irritated. They gathered outside my room discussing with my roommate,before leaving for the party.My roommate too didn't invite me either.The next few hours, I was thinking what I did wrong? why they left me alone? Why that guy lied? and this affected my normal day-day activities.I took longer time than usual in everything. I relapsed to chatting with strangers for hookups and jerked off after 25+ days of NoFap. I spent around 9 hours watching porn/porn images/chat with strangers.\n\n**How do I feel now?**\n* I know God has different plans for me and this party/get together is not for me.\n* I am gonna stop talking with everyone except the close ones and prove my worth by achieving a level higher than all those people.\n* I started my 2018 pretty good, with some self reflection and new thoughts for my PhD admission. I am kind of between introvert and extrovert, so my room was the ideal place for me anytime.\n*I set out a few goals for 2018 and I am on track.I have read 30 pages yesterday and continuing.Target: 100 books in 2018.\n*I didn't drink or eat crazy and have a good start.\n\nThough, everything is fine with me now,I would like to know any similar experiences and how people dealt with this. I am okay with not going for the party(bcoz, I would not have enjoyed as much as staying alone),but I could not handle the lie and the fact that everybody took great efforts to conceal this from me.\n\nTl;Dr: Not invited for the New Year celebration by lab mates.How to move forward??\nSorry if this is not the right subreddit to ask about this.",

You could approach them in a non-confrontational manner and explain that their exclusion made you feel left out and hurt. It's possible that they didn't realize the impact of their actions on you.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your personal issues. They can provide you with tools and strategies to manage your addiction and improve your self-esteem.\n\nIt's also important to take care of yourself and prioritize your well-being. This may involve setting boundaries around social interactions, taking time for self-reflection and self-care, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take time for yourself and prioritize your own needs.

I would tell my mother about how upset it made me, and she would reassure me that I had nothing to worry about. She said that I was slightly darker because she drank lot's of pepsi when she was pregnant (this doesn't sound rediculous when you're 13). By this point everyone at my school thinks I've gone mad or that I'm truly in denial about my skin. I wasn't, I was telling them genuinely what I thought was true. \n\n     When i turned 14, my parents got into a pretty hairy argument that was pretty normal at the time. My mom would be upset that my dad caught one of her lies, and she would make herself seem like the victim. My dad was pissed that she could easily make everyone feel so sorry for her (even if she was in the wrong), and he looked me straight in the eye and told me \"I'm not your real father\".

She told the ENTIRE family to keep the truth from me.\n\n    While i was in school, I couldn't look anyone in the eye. Not because i was mixed, but because I spent 2 years trying to convince everyone i was white. After this whole situation, there were two different kinds of people at my school.

I'm 18 now and everything was going great since my birthday (septemeber). I was about to graduate, I had a girlfriend I adored, friends always wanting to do something, and I just generally felt happy. Until early December when my abuser came back into my life ( and I'm too much of a bitch to tell amyone other than my best friend ), one of my friends became toxic and we've slowly distanced, and then my girlfriend dumped me. I was actually dealing with everything well enough but her dumping me was the straw that broke the fragile camel's back. Short anecdote, but my first girlfriend and I broke up in April. I being a vulnerable 17 year old idiot, decided to go on tinder and just find someone, someone who could fill that void. Instead of dating though I just fucked. And not in a good \"I'm having so much sex it feels great!\" kinda way, but more in a last ditch effort for a sense of validity and feeling wanted, followed by complete resentment and disgust in myself afterwards. My current ex helped me not live like this anymore back in June, but then she ended things on the 27th. It was after a long text about all my problems that was induced by a severe overload of anxiety. I don't feel like she's not justified, I just wish I hadn't sent her that. My mind instead of talking it out or anything instead defaulted to my old habits. It's been one week and I've had a one night stand with three different people. I hate it, I never feel macho or confidence boosted after just gross and shameful.\n\nSex and I have always sorta been like that though. I mentioned my abuser, in short she molested and raped me multiple times through blackmail when I was 15. That's how I lost my virginity. I get that society places too much of an emphasis on it but my first sexual experience was while I was crying, screaming for her to stop, and being berated. I would have preferred better. So after then I just stopped caring about it or myself and just did it whenever I was with someone willing to do such. I always convince myself though, that the person I'm about to have sex with will be someone I want to be with, but that's never the case, yet I keep falling for it. I feel like a sociopath, I keep using other people for a fucked up sense of emotional relief, a way to forget about my ex-girlfriends, to forget about how much I used to care, and to convince myself I've always been this way, I just hided it.\n\nI don't even know if half of this makes sense. I'm not even fully aware of why do it to be honest I think I'm addicted but I'm too terrified to admit that. This is more me just venting about being a manipulative cunt.

I like to think I'm self-sufficient, and that I'm equipped to deal with the crap the world throws at me.  I'm not accustomed to asking for help, especially when it comes to my illness.  You see, no one in my family knows I suffer from chronic depression, because I have never been diagnosed as such.  But the truth is I've spent the majority of my entire life battling self-loathing, feelings of hopelessness, and thoughts of suicide.  And as I slog through what must certainly be a mid-life crisis, it's getting harder and harder to deal with on my own.\n\nI am very slight of build, and I was bullied mercilessly as a child and teenager.  I learned to fight back, and have spent most of my life unwilling to put up with others' crap.  That has really hurt me socially and professionally, because everyone thinks I'm an asshole.  I'm now in my 40s, and I don't have any friends anymore, and don't really have much to do with my family, other than my mother.  I love her, and she loves me, but she's a tyrant.  She has supported me financially for years, and she's not afraid to remind me of that at every opportunity.  She's approaching her 70s now, and her health is deteriorating, leaving me as the only member of the family who would even consider caring for her (everyone else in my family draws disability or welfare, even though they're each perfectly capable of working, but none of them would lift a finger to care for my mother, so that falls on me).\n\nI went to college, where I did very well.  I have a bachelors degree in music education, but after graduating I discovered fairly quickly that I can't stand children (much less their overbearing parents).  So I am now thousands of dollars in debt (student loans) that I can't afford to pay, all for a degree in which turned out to be a waste of time. I was never a particularly stellar performer, so that avenue is closed to me as well.  However, I've spent the past 20 years writing and arranging music for school bands and band instruments in a bid to validate going to college in the first place and salvage some sort of professional career, and some dignity.  Unfortunately, composing and arranging pays little to no money...certainly not enough to pay bills or better myself.  The truth is, I'm an outcast in that world, because again, I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to tell music teachers when they're not doing a good job.  So I feel that door has closed as well.\n\nSince graduating college, I've had to resort to what amounts to a string of odd jobs which I've absolutely hated.  Customer service, human resources, retail, grocery, sales....all soul-crushing, tedious jobs that have always made me feel like a complete and utter failure in life, and wishing that writing music was a sustaining career.  \n\nAbout 10 years ago, I got involved in a relationship with a woman who nearly ruined my financially.  It took me a long time to bounce back from that, but I did.  I had to move back home, though.  Unfortunately, since then, I've had an incredibly difficult time finding work at all.  I live in the rural south, where the only good paying jobs are in nursing and truck driving (neither of which I can do, nor would ever want to).  I can't even get a job flipping burgers or working in a grocery store, because I'm a man in my 40s with a degree, and am (according to employers and staffing managers) overqualified for anything short of, according to them, brain surgery.  Factories won't hire me for the same reason (and also because I cannot lift more than 40 pounds).  I'm subscribed to dozens of different job websites, and can't count the number of times I've nearly been scammed by fraudulent job listings...the sort that prey upon desperate people like me.  I've wasted thousands of dollars in gasoline driving to places of business in order to apply, only to be told \"You have to apply online\", and am then ridiculed by friends and family who assert \"You have to go meet employers face to face if you want to get hired\".  \n\nIn the past I've actually moved around the country in order to find work, but I've always been held back by 1). There's no such thing as a permanent full time job anymore, and 2). The extremely high cost of living, and anyway, as my mother gets older, that's no longer an option.  I'm stuck here, and I'm going broke.  If it weren't for my mother, I would be homeless, and just a few days ago she informed me that \"we're\" moving from a decent house in a quiet neighborhood to a mobile home next to a railroad....the last thing in the world my ego and self-esteem need right now.\n\nI don't have health insurance.  I can't even afford it.  The state I live in doesn't offer Medicaid,  the premiums are too expensive on even the cheapest plans, and the copays at my local health department are too expensive.  My student loan is on deferment until they get tired of me requesting deferments (which may very will be next month).  I've been dealing with internal and external hemorrhoids for a decade, and I can't afford even have them looked at, much less do anything about it.  And I certainly can't afford therapy, or counseling, or medication for this depression.   Coupled with the fact that I don't even want to get out of bed most days, combined with the fact that I'm not getting any younger...I'm beginning to see the writing on the wall.\n\nI'm a proud man.  I don't like to ask for help.  I don't want to apply for welfare or financial assistance, because 1). I most likely wouldn't qualify for it, and 2). to me, that's admitting total defeat, and surrendering any shred of dignity I have left.  I certainly don't like to ask for help from strangers on the internet, because frankly, I think it's a total waste of time and effort.  But I can feel a darkness creeping up on me, preparing to strangle the very life out me.  I see no hope for a future.  It just makes me so angry.  I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I've stayed out of trouble, and I don't bother anyone.  I worked very hard to better myself and, for my part, I've been a good person.  I don't care about money or wealth.  I just want a sense of purpose in life.  I want to be able to pay my bills and actually buy things I want rather than just what I need.  I want to be respected for my talents, and maybe even remembered when I'm gone.  But all of that seems totally out of reach now.  It's infuriating to see my suggested earning potential on job sites ($89,000 per year, btw), and then get a prospectus from Social Security letting me know that as of right now, when I turn 65 I'll only get $330 a month.  That makes it feel like everything, my education, my work history, my entire life...has all been for nothing.\n\nI don't know what to do.  I applied for over 20 jobs today, and I won't hear back from a single employer because I'm a forty-something with a college degree.  I'm tired of being supported financially by my ailing mother.  I want to support HER.  I want to be able to afford an apartment at the very least, and not have to move into a damn trailer less than 20 feet from railroad tracks.  I want her to be proud of me.  I want my college professors to be proud of me.  I want to be proud of myself.  \n\nBut part of me also wants off this ride.  Part of me is afraid things are not going to get better.  How can they?  I'm running out of ideas.  I'm running out of options.  And I'm running out of patience.  I just don't know what else to do.\n",

I'm awful depressed because I'm lonely and feel I'm the only guy my age (22) who hasn't dated anyone, or even had any close friends I could trust and talk to. Never really hung out with anyone. Though I wish to change that and make a few friends in college, but not only do I not know how to go about it even though it's my third year, but I just feel that nobody would care about me. In fact, everyone from high school completely forgot about me, even before graduation, and we're a small class and everyone knows everyone's name. \n\nThere's a lot of things that drift through my mind when I try to work through this, and I just get overwhelmed.  \n\nA number of things leave me feeling worthless about myself.  \n\nI happen to be mildly autistic, which honestly I don't understand much about it, but in school, word spread about it and plenty of people started talking to me as though I was retarded, even a few that knew I was just like any of them. I should be able to just get over that, but... you can only wonder if people are telling you that you're intelligent and capable out of pity so many times before you start getting paranoid.  \n\nPlus, I see tons of other people who seem to have good friends they're always hanging out with, but I never know how to introduce myself to someone, honestly I'm scared I'll make an ass of myself. Enough that I literally get paralyzed when I try to talk to someone, my jaw seizes up and everything. But I'm ok with people approaching me, which never seems to happen, it's only happened once in my life. This makes me think, is the easier problem to fix that I struggle starting conversations, or that nobody wants to talk to me? \n\nI've got pretty bad image issues, too... I know that it's almost impossible to find a guy who'll say it, but there it is. I won't say I'm a heavy guy, because I don't look particularly bulky, but I... look up gynecomastia and you got me. I look like I've got boobs, and yes I'm a man and *hell* no, I'm not trans. I've been trying to work out and loose them, but while I've been loosing some weight they're not really being affected. I'll never look good in a tee shirt like this, it seems, and that's kinda why I'm struggling to start an athletic lifestyle... again, vicious cycle I gotta break out of. \n\nLots of things to work through here...

I'm 21 and I feel like my life is already doomed, like there is no way out of this.\n\nI've been struggling with paradoxical feelings, because I met a girl who I've fallen in love with, but she has bpd and got a full time job. We rarely speak now, only in March will she be available again. She makes me feel good about myself, like the only thing that truly makes me happy. I care about her so much, so I am letting her set her life straight and not talk to her. She's rarely in the mood anyways, as she gets home too tired to talk or too depressed. She told me she loves me, but she's not ready for a relationship yet. I'd love to heal her and make her happy, regardless of being in a relationship with her or not. I just want her to be happy. That alone, would make things better.\n\nI struggle with some kind of mental illness. I can't say what it is, since I've never been diagnosed. I believe, however that I have depression and/ or avpd.\n\nAlso, she lives in another country and I'm scared that if I meet her in person, things will change. Like, she will stop liking me. I'm very awkward in real life and can't express a fourth of what I write.\n\nI'm scared of completely deliver my heart to her, although I do trust her. But, I just have a feeling that she may not want it, since she mentioned she's not ready for a relationship yet.\n\nShe's been with abusive exes and has a rough past, which is no wonder she is trying to protect herself.\n\nSo what should I do? We are both afraid, but we love each other. We are planning to eventually meet up one day. But that is what scares us. We are afraid of hurting each other and being hurt. Maybe because it may won't work out, not because we would actually hurt each other.\n\nShe's my everything. This is the first time I felt such strong feelings. I am numb on the inside, but when I am with her, all my demons fade away.\n\nIt frustrates me being so useless to her. I want to do something for her, but she's been to busy.

The only thing that keeps me from doing it is that I have family who loves me, and I have online friends who are also family to me. If I ever did it, they would not know about it, I'd just become inactive forever, and that would certainly pain them more than my family since they would not know if I was dead or not.\n\nEven so, I don't know how long I'll last.

I am a quiet, peaceful, so I was bullied harshly - like throwing lit matches at me, laughing at my acne, once whole gym with 70 people laughed, because I couldn't make a simple exercise, dog barked when we were coming back from school and they said \"Even dog doesn't like you\". To add fuel to the fire, when I came back home parents were screaming at each other, because of my alcoholic father and financial problems. I was totally alone with all the problems and it seemed like whole world is against me.\n\nAfter few months I changed school with \"normal\" people not thugs. However something changed in me. The world was dark, I had negative thoughts about myself, world and others 24/7 like \"I am worthless\", \"People are evil and want to use me\", \"People are suffering around the world\". I had nightmares everynight like I was holding injured man on apocalyptic landscape and there was an atomic alarm, on the sky there was a sign \"magnetic field can kill you\" then I woke up screaming, but the real world looked like in this nightmare. There was no escape. At start I fought with it, but after a while I accepted this dark world. I watched dark movies, listened to dark ambient etc. This lasted 6 years. I tried many SSRI's, but nothing worked. \n\nAt the end of high school I started experimenting with dissociatives like ketamine. They helped me a little, but at the end of school I tried to commit suicide and was sent again to psychiatrist. He gave me venlafaxine and it was miracle. It changed my world in 30 minutes, color started to be brighter, mental pain wasn't there, no negative thoughts, doing things started to be pleasurable again. I mixed it with dissociatives, because there are studies linking ketamine as useful with depression treatment. Now, after 3 years I don't use ketamine or SSRI's and my world looks like heaven.

I was fat most of my life, except for a few years when I was a teen. I'm 5'10 (178cm) and 285 pounds (130kg) atm, I'm really unhappy with my body and my voice. I'm not handsome by any standard and I'm poor too (and I'm getting bald).\n\nRecently I fell in love for a girl but she lives in US and she's smart and beautiful, I'm from western Europe and I don't have the money to go to US. If I had the means to go I'd surely at least try even though I know I'd probably be rejected (like, 99.9% of chance). I have a lot of responsibilities here too. I'm losing weight but it's probably going to take a few months/years to reach my ideal and even when that happens I guess I'll have loose skin. The fact is: I wouldn't want to date someone like me, how can I expect others to? Please don't come up with that acceptance thing, although I really appreciate the good intentions I just can't change what my brain finds attractive or not.\n\nI've never been with a girl I loved ( or not :P ), I've only loved 3 girls so far, one when I was 17 and I was slim and such, but I didn't have the balls to express my feelings. Then again when I was I guess 20 or something, I wasn't very obese so I was somewhat OK with my weight, but the girls was from Australia and we didn't even have the time to know each other better.\n\nPeople keep saying that's a 'crush' or something, but that's a start isn't it? I mean, I don't feel like approaching girls I don't feel something strong for and I totally don't believe 'real long-lasting love' will emerge from a forced relationship. A girl once wanted to approach me (but I was in love with that 2nd girl) so I suppose I'm not unbearably ugly but I certainly can't compete with the other guys in terms of looks.\n\nI've been working my 'bottom' off for some time now, and I hope to make some money to be financially comfortable, but I don't want a girl to like me because of that, while I surely plan to use some of the money to improve myself.\n\nI like smart girls with strong political opinions and definitely I don't like 'good' girls that are OK with everything and always trying to avoid conflicts. This girls I'm in love with really seems the perfect match, I honestly never been so sure about that, but I simply can't have her.\n\nSo, this is the situation I'm facing at the moment, my heart aches so much but I don't express it to others. I don't have anyone to talk about that only my dog and although that helps a bit it doesn't count much.\n\nI'm trying to focus on my work to forget her but I can't. Everything I see feels familiar in a way that reminds her, this is something I never felt before, even looking at this text somehow I remind her face. Maybe there's a hormonal imbalance or something. I'm certainly not discarding the possibility of a physiological effect.\n\nSo, sorry for the big text and thank you for reading it. I'd really appreciate any advice on that. Thank you very much.\n\n**EDIT** Added metric units",

I'm not sure whether I want to post here or in /r/SuicidalWatch/ as I'm having mixed feelings.\n\nI'm from the type of people who pays attention to the detail, so let me give you some background. I'm a 19-y-o boy working as a waiter, which job was wrapped up by my grandmother. Yeah, living with my parents, and grandparents. I'm living in a very advanced level of poverty... even this is a miracle considering the chances, in my country, of being employed solely on a diploma.\nThis is the job I've started off after living 4 months of unemployment. I really f|cking prefer living my whole live unemployed, rather than being employed in such a sh|tty job. \"Why don't you just change your job? Or the very least, change the workplace?\" It's not as simple as that. No one hires. This just as in, because you really do need a good certification or degree from (preferably) the... richest... places. E.g. Microsoft certification, or an Oxford degree.\nNow let me tell you about the job I'm stuck on working. Every. goddamn. day. And I'm almost wanting to cry typing this, because it only reminds me of what I'll have to face tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and et cetera. I don't like my job, because co-workers, I don't like the F&amp;B Manager (Food and Bar Manager), I don't like the boss, and the clients, towards which I force myself to have positive feelings, because I'm a waiter, and this is a positive, and a default trait.\nI'm an outsider working with not-so-intelligent co-workers, but very experienced in the field. It's because I'm new and know nothing about this genre. No one teaches me anything regarding how to work, and how to work the work. When I try to do something on my own, I usually fail, because no one offers a hand (referred as to teaching), then the staff of the whole hotel (the workplace) gather togheter, talking to each other that I'm incompetent, I'm stupid, they laugh at me, and feel a relief telling me \"You aren't good for anything. Better quit this job as soon as you can. It's the same even if you're working. You're only causing troubles, and issues.\" \nA usual worker would think, \"Well, it's not an estimation by a manager.\" But the thing is, my co-workers are very close with the manager, and always whine to him how I'm not good for anything. If I try to 'raise my voice' (figuratively), I always get a huge backlash of bullshit. I.e. there has been a problem, and I'm not in fault, but if it is in correlation with the experienced co-workers, it usually is my fault. Kind of a handicap. It got to a point where my manager cuts a lot of tasks, duties, and obligations, because I'm 'incompetent'. Today he saw me trying to carry 2 things at once, and got irritated, then told me by a very unpleased voice and body language 'Just stop trying to multi-task.' But I usually am good in multi-tasking, but the cowardice feeling (anxiety closy-by [It's really not anxiety, but I really do get VERY scared]) of having someone around me that watches what I'm doing, and probably expects the failure. And it really increases the chance of failure.\nI really do have a friend of mine in the staff, but this can't really compensate anything. I have (had) friends, with which I've lost contact long time ago, and basically what I'm doing in life currently is go home, sleep, and to work again.\n\n[#The Having Positive Feelings Towards Thoughts Of Death]\nI usually watch entertaining or educational videos, which I've watched before, but the difference is that now I don't feel anything. I just feel depression, which cannot leave me. When watching utensils, I get a little uplifting feeling, which is caused by thoughts of harming myself. I really can't do anything about it, nor can you. The premise is that I want to get A LOT of weight off of my burden.\n\nThis is the life I'm living. Handicapped. It literally feels like you're tied, and can do nothing else, but to accept hard hits. Thank you for paying attention... not even the guests of the hotel are That merciful.",

A Hunger Games type of feel.\n\nIt's a big war on who has the biggest dick.\n\nEvery minute, I compare with others about everything.\n\nHow managed to get what they wanted at a much earlier age than I do. \nHow they manage to get a hold of their own life but I ever did. \n\nHow much I keep comparing grades *(which is my greatest weakness because I focus on it too much on a daily basis but I end getting bad grades anyway because my anxiety keeps killing me ... makes me procrastinate and black out and give up)*\n\nEvery day I am shaking the minute I wake up. \n\nEvery day, I feel like I have this need, this compulsion, this must to be better than everyone else in every way ... but I am too weak. \n\n\n\n\nI am paralysed in that endless competition against others and everyone else in this world goddamned planet and at the same time, I lack the slighest motivation to even do the slightest change because I give up before I even do anything because I have an inferiority complex, one that I feel like I am an ant among giants or gods.\n\n*(or when I did make a move to be better, I pushed so much that it took over my life. An obsession that became so invasive and destructive that instead of my mind verbally and psychologically abusing me in one way, I allowed it to abuse me in a different way. When I did want to make a change, I went too far and it became dysfunctional)*\n\nIn my head, I feel like I am at war. I feel like I am in an endless bloody nightmare against my own head. Sometimes, I even lay down my arms before it starts because I am too exhausted and fed up of fighting over and over and over and over again.\n\nOn the outside, I feel frozen. I am shaking every day. Even right now, I am shaking because I am constantly being reminded on how much of a pathetic, weak and ungrateful little bastard I am because no matter how much I try, no matter how much I wanted to push myself, I never am able to do it.\n\nWhen I try to be better, I fuck up. I panic, I feel like giving up, I feel like I running through a battlezone where there are a thousand bombs exploding everywhere, terrified as hell. I feel little and weak and scared.\n\nI feel like I am walking on a thin rope but I am shaking because I am scared. \n\nI feel like a thousand voices are screaming inside my head constantly all the time. They make me shake even more and because of that, I end up falling\n\nAgain. And again and again.\n\nSometimes, I even fall on purpose because I want to hurt myself because even though I have that compulsion to be better, I give up immediately.\n\nIt's like when there is a bully who is about to beat me, I beat myself instead just to save the time and energy and because I deserve it.\n\nSo I do that over and over and over again. From the minute I wake up. Every minute, I feel like I am in a battle between myself and my self hatred and more often than not, my self hatred wins.\n\nSo I beat myself. Over and over again.\n\nAnd then I keep noticing how much I hate myself and because of that, I feel pathetic. I feel despicable.\n\nAnd when I compare myself to others, that is the perfect fuel to add to the fire that is already burning me from the inside while I am tied up with my mouth shut.\n\nI sit on my chair or stay on my bed, staring at the wall, or looking at the paper that I am supposed to write. I end up staring at it for hours, because I even lack that tiniest skills or the tiniest effort to push myself to even do it. But even if I did try, I know that I don't want to \"just try\", I want to go all out. 100%. ... No, 200%. 300%. I want to be the best. The best of the best. But I feel pathetic either way. So, I don't do much effort. \n\nSo I get bad grades or fail .... another perfect fuel to the fire. \n\nMy mind feels like it hit the gold mine. It has the perfect tools to make its bitch. It has me chained like an animal and it slaps and belittles every minute.\n\nI look at others, I don't see people, I see numbers and qualities, those who have beaten me, those who I need to beat, those who I am already better than them and those who I absolutely can never beat.\n\nAll of them, my mind will still find ways to make its bitch even more.\n\n**\"He has got better hair than you do.

I bet she is making out with him while you are too busy trying to control your anxiety\"**\n\n**\"That competition who stole the girl you liked, he is probably much more of a man than you are in every way. I bet they just love to have wild sex together, making you feel like a wimp that you already are\"**\n\n**\"Look at you. More Ds and Es. Of course you are gonna get those grades.

That constant terror.\n\nIt is so much easier to just grab the rope and end it right there. \n\nWhy would you choose to keep experiencing this day by day, night after night?\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nEven right now, as I am typing this, I am reading and re-reading what I wrote, I am constantly shaking, I cannot think clearly and my mind is keeping a sharp eye on whatever spelling mistake or grammatical error or how much I sound like a person whose language are as poor as a mentally retarded person because his anxiety is so high everyday that he cannot think clearly at all, that mind is like a bully behind me, waiting to strike when I am at my most vulnerable. When I feel ashamed for a mistake that I made. When I am reminded about a past grade that I wished I could have done better. When I lost someone who cared about to someone else.\n\nI often wish that I could grab a gun and shoot myself in the head. Maybe I will make that voice in my head shut up once and for all, but then again, it will still win anyway. Suicide is for cowards and pussies anyway ... and it calls me a coward and a pussy everyday.\n\nIf I keep breathing air in this damned planet, it will find a way to make me suffer and win anyway in the end. If I just end it, it will win either way. \n\nIt's like fate has already decided isn't it? It's as if fate has put a curse on me and I cannot do anything about it",

Honestly though, I don't think I'm at fault here.\nFast forward to middle school and high school, I was/am still alone all the time. Literally.\n\nI'm always alone during recess and I haven't smiled genuinely in 2 years now. I do get happy sometimes but never smiled genuinely.\nAll the friendships I had just crashed and burned because me and the other person(s) never interacted much in real life or not interacted enough. \n\nMost of my \"strong\" friendships have been through messaging rather than real life reactions. I have never been in trouble or on an adventure with anyone when those stuff are exactly what makes the base of a real and strong friendship.\n\nNot to mention that I have been made fun of a lot for my taste of music or the way I dress or why I never diet to lose a couple of pounds (seriously, I am fat but not obese.)\n\nAnd because I went through a lot of difficulties during childhood and early adolescence and I had no one to advice me or be there for me, I've gotten really self conscious and insecure about almost everything. And I'll be honest here, I hate myself so much because of it and I have tried to commit suicide multiple times before.\n\nGetting bullied, being underestimated and looked down upon by your classmates and teachers and also being left alone all the time does make one think \"why? Why am I the only one alone and why am I soooo hated and unwelcome everywhere? Am I such a bad person?\" And all those endless questions and the dark abyss of depression.\n\nI have a strict dad who doesn't let me do most things others my age do and a mom who doesn't want me to defy my dad. Also, financially speaking, I don't come from a rich family like my classmates do but we have enough to live and afford a couple of luxuries.\nI love my family so much but they have never understood my problems and struggles which is the main reason why I am the way I am right now. I'm pretty sure if we at least tried to understand each other, not just me but not one of my family members would suffer from a chronic depression and/or have thoughts of dying and committing suicide.\nMy family don't understand me, they love me but they don't understand me which is why I can't have a real deep conversation with any of them.\n\nRecently, I have found quite a few good people as friends but because we all have our own priorities, we barely see each other and most of the time our interactions are through texts, and that way we won't have a strong and/or real friendship and I also think a lot about it because I honestly don't know what having friends is like... I don't want to be the only one who cares a lot about the others and would go to such extents for them but then after a while the whole friendship crashes and burns.\nI want to tell them that I am here to stay but I also know that now is not the time because we have to have more real life interactions and know each other more.\n\nSpeaking of my other friendships... The friendships I considered to be real ended up with me being stabbed in the back and left alone with a broken heart.\nAnd I found out that I had no real friends but everyone were just classmates when I considered them to be friends last year when I lost a very dear uncle whom I loved more than both my parents and considered myself to be his daughter, no one had my back then... No one told me to cheer up or at least kept me company until I was strong enough to overcome it.\n\nRight now I am very exhausted of everything... I just want to relax a bit feeling respected and loved a little without worrying about who I am.\n\nI just want to stop hating myself and start loving myself, build up my self esteem.\n\nSo tell me, great people of reddit, how do I stop hating myself, deal with loneliness and depression (preferably overcome both of them) and keep these new friendships I have made going without forcing any of those whom I deeply love and care about?\n\nWith kindest regards, ",
