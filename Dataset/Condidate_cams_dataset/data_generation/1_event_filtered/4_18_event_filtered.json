Me and him had a lot in common, and while a number of us found him to be annoying, I stuck up for the guy. I told him about my past - my first love was a long distance relationship and when i went to visit her, it turned out to be nothing more than a huge joke on her end and that gave me trust issues.\n\nTime moves on, we end up becoming roommates with another mutual friend. Eventually, introduced into my life is this other girl.  She's a bit of a depressed wreck, and given my past, her being into me as much as she was, made me a bit hesitant to label the relationship.  We slept together a number of times, and eventually my friend found out, much to my dislike.  They got along a bit TOO well for my liking, to the point where i told him that if he ever slept with her, it would end our friendship.\n\nA couple weeks ago, i saw her leave his room and our apartment ever so casually without making eye contact with me. Knowing immediately what was up, I questioned him about it.  I went into his room, saw the condom, and what really, REALLY hammered in the betrayal, the breach of trust wasn't anything they did.  It wasn't the fact that something was important to me that he knew about and selectively ignored. \n\nIt was the lying.\n\nHe's been tossed out of the apartment since, but he is coming back once winter break is over. But in this process, i'm done.\nEarlier, i was an apathetical cynical wreck who no one cared about, but now I can't bring myself to trust anyone, even the other roommate.  My friend was the more outgoing of us, so of course he has more friends, but I can't involve myself with any of them, much less anyone else because I can't...trust them.  In one fell swoop, it feels like he's taken everything from me. \n\nI don't care for my job anymore. It's means to an end, and that end is a pretty pathetic life. I'm at the point where i'm done with everything, because as far as i'm concerned, I don't see anything positive anymore. ",

        "Origin_reddit": "Hey Folks,\n\nI feel that I really need a place to vent. This past September I was accepted into a program I've always dreamed of being in which was a great win for me. Unfortunately, it turned out to be bitter sweet because my grandmother passed away after a long battle with cancer shortly after starting. It really tore me up because I had to move away in August and didn't ever call her before she passed. I guess always felt I had something higher up on the list before calling her and might have been scared to call her too so just avoided it. The next time I saw her in person she was on a ventilator and heavily sedated, a shadow of her former self. \n\nThe next months I kept busy with school which kept me from dealing with this event properly. Things just got worse from there though as one of my aunts was found dead in her house (heart attack) and another underwent surgery and ended up in the ICU. I feel I buried myself in school, shutting myself out from my emotions and told myself I would work through everything when I got home for Christmas break. The first day home, however, my mom got a call saying that the aunt who had surgery took a drastic turn for the worse and was on her death bed. This takes me up to now. This aunt who meant the world to me died and I just have lost all energy to function and have shut down. I'm scared to go back to school with all of this stuff still unresolved and I just want to feel appropriately for all of these losses. I've had a few complete breakdowns this last week but the grief hangs over me still. \n\nI think this is a first step to dealing with these issues but I'd really appreciate anyone else's perspectives. \n\nThank you",

        "Origin_reddit": "Backstory: I'm 21. My dad just turned 73. I have the typical father / daughter relationship every girl wishes to have. I was spoiled growing up. Yes, he's old. Yes, I was an accident. Yes, my parents are still together. Let's continue. \n\nLast year was big for me. Was promoted as the youngest employee company wide to have my position. I moved out. Travelled a LOT. Last year I also learned my dad's cancer had spread and it was a lot more serious this time. I was on my own, living my own life, for 6 months. I realized how bad things had gotten, and I broke my lease and moved back home to help assist my parents with things around the house. In May, he stopped treatment. He was given 6-9 months. We are now at the 9 month mark and he's on his way to a hospital bed in our living room. Meanwhile, my mom is a chainsmoker who is  coming down with pneumonia. \n\nBack to the point. My father is old, and has lived a very good life. I cannot be angry that his time has come. What I am angry about, however, is the fact I am now lost. Here comes my thought process.\n\nWatching my mother take care of my dad in ways I would have never thought possible, how will she handle this when her husband is no longer on this earth?\n\nHe will without a doubt pass in my childhood home. When is the appropriate time to move out again? Will my mom be okay to take care of herself? \n\nI'm taking a lot of time off of work, and my boss is okay with it under the given circumstances. What if I'm not ready to return?\n\nMy mom lost her mother during the summer of 2015. Now she's losing her husband Spring of 2017, if he makes it that far. As far as family goes, it's just me and my brother, who has a family of his own. \n\nShe's the type of mom who will spend hundreds of dollars on presents if it means not having to keep in touch daily / be a babysitter etc.. Not because she dislikes us, but because she has always been an independent, introverted.. er, bitch. When she does connect with you, it is something to be adored. She has a very unique way of showing love and it's the only love I have ever known from her. \n\nI keep having to remind myself that I am 21 and have my whole life ahead of me, but is that selfish? I'm not looking to abandon her after this is all said and done, but I ~feel~ like I need to return to my life as soon as possible. It's taking a toll on me mentally, and as a result, I'm isolating myself from friends and social gatherings. I just have no desire to do those things anymore. Some days its hard to get out of bed because I can't do anything. It's not that I don't WANT to get up start my day, I just lay there and think, \"whats the point? I don't need plans.\" That's new. My parents are in the other room together 90% of the time, while I spend my entire day in my room trying to find things to distract me from my current life. I don't like thinking about the future because I feel exhausted trying to make those thoughts seem realistic. I'm either very irritable or so quiet that I don't think I can talk. The thought of going back to work to make money to resume the life I had seems unpalatable. \n\nI guess what I'm saying is, I'm stuck in a very large rut and I don't know what direction to go in, I just know that I need to get out of it.\n\nTLDR: My dad is dying of natural causes, I put my life on pause to spend time with him, I realized that my mom might not do too well alone, and I don't know how / when / if I will go back to my life before I moved home or how I want to resume my life to move on.",

As much as they keep saying things like how kind I am to them (\"dude... if you really just said that, then you're not paying attention\") how good I am at listening, how much I helped (with what?)... nobody comes to me anymore when things happen. Unless I ask first, but by that time the damage is already done or they are already out of it.\n\nSo this friend and I talked and we talked for hours.

I will makes things worse for you.\"\nDid I just say that? Really? Damn you, Bluerain12ya, what the hell are you doing?!?!\n\nIt hurt me.

Why am I alive?\n\nMy mum recently told me about her depression which I knew nothing about. I didn't know how to react...\nMy crush was hospitalised due to a failed suicide attempt and despite how much we talked and helped each other in the past, she went to that other friend I talked to last night. I didn't even have the chance to help her. People who know about my depression, my medication, my self harm stopped talking to me. Sure we talk when I meet them, or if I message first, but for them to come to me first?\nHell, they are probably right. I'd just let them down anyway...\n\nThe only person I do talk on a semi-daily basis is someone I've met on r/selfharmpics\nI have my doubts if I should message her any more, or rather if she should come to me and trust me with her problems.

But I promised her, that I will not leave, I won't push her away and I won't let her push me away. That I might keep my distance if she needs it, but I will always be close enough to reach me. But I'm terrified that I'm just making things worse!!!\n\nAnd I tried. I though if I try to help others, maybe I can take my mind off of things, and if they feel better, than I feel better, too. But I can't. And nobody wants to come to me. Nobody should come to me, anyway, since now I realise that I'll just be worthless... I'll just end up hurting them even more.\n\nI want to run away.

I didn't quite figure out what he was saying until the next morning.\n\nWe had gotten into an argument because he felt that I wasn't paying attention to him. I disagree. I was paying attention to him. Of course my six year old sister was going to act more excited to see him than a I do on an average day. He's a novelty to her. She thinks he's awesome. She loves when people just exist. She's six. And I made an error with the time that I went to his house, so we only got an hour and a half rather than the two hours I planned for. When we got to my house, he didn't make any effort to do Christmas dinner stuff with me or talk to me. And then he was mad at me for not spending that hour with him when he didn't try spending the hour with me. I tried. I tried to make everything fucking perfect. I was nervous. His family does Christmas differently. This was my chance to show him my traditions and we'd mix our traditions together in our future. I felt like we didn't get to be together much, so I invited him to help my sister try out her telescope. Apparently he didn't want to, but there was no communication. He didn't say anything. I sent my sister inside when we couldn't figure out how to use the telescope. He wouldn't come inside. He quiet-whisper-yelled \"no\" when I asked if he wanted to go inside. He told me that he never wanted to go outside. That I had been ignoring him all day/night. I don't remember everything that I said, but after he accusingly told me that my sister seemed more excited to see me then I have in a long time, I got angry. I told him that he could either come inside or stay outside. His choice.\n\nWhen I came back outside after composing myself a bit, he was gone. The gift from my parents were sitting on the front steps and he was gone. I was terrified. I am terrified of people just leaving and disappearing without a trace. And he did just that. I texted him to ask where he was while trying to quell the rising panic. He could get hit by a car or get sick from the cold or just completely vanish forever. He replied that he was a good distance down the road. I panicked for a moment while formulating a plan. I went inside and grabbed my keys. I was going to tell my parents and grandparents that I'd be back, but they seemed so happy. I could totally handle this on my own while everything was falling apart.\n\nI drove to the intersection and pulled into an empty parking lot nearby and got out. He was across the street and I wouldn't be able to safely cross right away, so I screamed his name. I'm not really the kind of person to scream, but I was angry and hurt and still panicking. I don't remember everything I said on the drive to his house. I did tell him that no matter how angry I was in previous arguments that I have never and would never just walk away like that. I told him that I wanted to in one, but I purposely left my purse and maybe my shoes so that I couldn't make a rash decision out of anger.\n\nWhen we parted, he said, \"Over next few days, you should think about whether we should keep fighting for us or not,\" which I responded to with, \"Are you going to?\" I guess I heard it in a condescending way or something. He said of course. He said \"I still love you\" and I told him the same. Then he went into his house and I left and went home absolutely destroyed. I cried a tiny bit, but it wasn't hitting me. Then I got home and saw that my grandparents had just left and I was just devastated. When I came inside I cried into my stepmom's lap for like, ever. When I looked at my phone to say goodnight and send my love, I saw the following...\n\n\"I'm sorry the night had to end that way.\"\n\n\"We're two totally different people and we don't seem to work well together. All we do is hurt each other anymore and it's getting to be draining. I need to get better and you need to get better and we spend too much time working against each other. I'm sorry. I tried. And you did, too. It's time to focus on ourselves.\"\n\nAnd that was sent at 9:15. I got home around 8 or 8:30. It felt like he had already decided early on. That wasn't the couple of days. It was barely an hour.\n\nHe then unfriended me and my family on Facebook. This was like, the 27th. We officially broke up on the 26th, I guess.\n\nI don't know if I forgive him. I don't think that I do. I feel like he put the entire night being fucked up on me. Like I should have done better. And I usually tell myself that. I usually tell myself that I should have done this or that. But not this time.\n\nI don't know how to move on or push through or whatever. I miss him and I still love him and I don't want him out of my life forever. I've never been so heartbroken. I feel empty and I am depressed. I've always gone to him. I trusted him. I'm telling myself that now he can go find someone who isn't stupid. Someone who isn't afraid of intimacy. I don't know, someone better. Maybe he wants to just forget about me with my fucked up brain and chemical imbalances and mood disorder like everyone else should. I don't know what to do and I'm really trying to just be happy but I can't. I barely got through New Year's Eve.

To this day I question my sanity, is this real or am I just exaggerating?\n\nIt sure as hell feels real having been dumped two days ago. When my ex tells me I'll never be happy.

She's right I guess.\n\nI feel utterly worthless and alone.\n\nIn my senior year of high school I went through my worst and only other breakup.

        "Origin_reddit": "So, my husband (25) was diagnosed with depression/anxiety and put on meds at age 11. He hardly knows life without depression. Aside from a few isolated episodes, it's been mostly under control. He's not suicidal or super moody, but he's not living life to the fullest either. He's just...there.\n\nFor the last few months, he's been unemployed, still trying to find a solid career. No degree past high school, hoping to get into bookkeeping (trying to take the learn by doing route). Luckily, we get by just fine on my income alone, but I still want him to find a career or something fulfilling to do outside of the home. \n\nI'd understand if there just weren't any jobs out there (but the job market is pretty good where we live), but we both know full well that he's not putting in sufficient effort to get a job in a timely manner. So at the very least I expect him to be helpful around the apartment, doing dishes, laundry, etc. Or at least try developing a routine so he can feel better (regular exercise, good diet, meditation, structure, etc.) But it's a struggle for him to even do that. He's just constantly drained.\n\nI understand that this comes with the depression package. But I am still conflicted. I'm trying my best to be patient and non-judgmental. But I have a hard time telling if it's his own dang fault, or if it's depression that he can't help. I don't know whether to be angry or compassionate. Is there any way to tell the difference? I fear bringing this up with him too often for fear of making him feel even worse about himself.\n\nAlso, I understand that with the current state of depression medication, there is no cure, only things to make depression bearable. We're also apprehensive about changing meds too much since that can bring on a lot of emotional turmoil in the weeks it takes for the new medication to work. But how do you know or judge what is an acceptable level of functioning and what's unacceptable (and calls for a prescription change, therapy, etc)?\n\nTLDR: At what point do you see a therapist/psychiatrist? How much depression (after meds and such) is acceptable? And how do I as his spouse strike a balance between pushing him to be better and being supportive? \n\n",

When I got back to college, I got a 3.9 GPA the first semester back.

I loved that girl so much, and she loved me too but i was too fucked up.

We still talk and she still likes me, but it doesn't help. I was too much and not enough at the same time. We broke up almost a month ago but it feels useless to try.

I used to be able to wrestle which I think would have saved me but I got an injury about a week after my breakup. I have friends that will listen but they don't hear me. All they do is give me advice on things they know nothing about and I'm sick of it. They only do that because they don't want to feel guilty.

She knows that, and for some weird reason she still talks to me and she still likes me and misses me but i know i'm not good enough. I feel like because I need her to feel happy, It means I'm not whole. I guess i'm not, like i feel really empty but even more than the empty lost lonely things is the feeling that i'm not good enough.

        "Origin_reddit": "I'm a people-pleaser. I like to fix, serve and help them, anyway possible  \n  \nThat's kind of how our relationship started. I saw a complex, interesting girl hidden underneath all the darkness surrounding her and decided to help. It was not romantic until a month into knowing each other when I realized that I have just opened up to an almost stranger in a manner I never did.  \n  \nSo, I knew it would be difficult from Day 1. There were so many things wrong with her behavior and I would spent days, weeks, months explaining some things. Sometimes it helped, sometimes it didn't, I never gave up on caring for her. The amount of times I heard from others (her family, friends, herself) about her getting so much better, that it was visible and how they believed in me helping her with day-to-day life. It made me feel that none of my sacrifices are going to waste.  \n  \nHowever, she went back to school, last year and she started to revert back to her old ways. I didn't say much at the beginning, hoping it would pass shortly, but it only got worse. She would be disrespectful, mean and cynical towards everything. Cold and cruel. You could say I was almost waiting for my turn, but instead I decided to not be too critical for the moment.  \n  \nIt got worse. To the point where I believed I was going crazy accusing her of any bad behavior. I started to believe her saying \"it's all in your head and your imaginary worlds\". I couldn't take it anymore, the amount of hurt combined with both my heart and mind being broken, it started to affect my work, my lifestyle, my want to live like I used to. I told her about everything, criticized her behavior and in the end all I got was a \"Go fuck yourself. If I'm so terrible, leave me\".  \n  \nI broke mentally at that moment. I didn't know whether i was going insane or not, I even suggested going to a therapist for both my, her and the relationship's sake and to get some help because clearly I was being overwhelmed, but in the end she said she didn't feel like fixing my problems and that she wants to end things. She grew cold, distant and apathetic in a matter of days and continued to be like that for a month until we broke up.  \n  \nThe breaking up itself... she refused to meet me in person, even after I said it was disrespectful. Again, I was told to fuck off via text and told to finally think about this relationship (like wasn't thinking about it and improving it 24/7 since Day 1...). I told her everything that I thought she could work on with her behavior and said my good-byes. Her last words were \"you finally thought all of it through\".  \n  \nNot longer three days after the break-up I found from her, now ex, old friend that she started dating another guy and has been hooking up with him for two weeks.  \n  \nAfter a few days, she had the audacity to ask me how I was doing. My first question was quite simple \"was any of that real or did you just need someone to help you get back on your feet?\". Her answer crushed the goddamn soul out of me: \"Don't mind it. I already forgot. Just forget it. But take my advice: don't jump into a new relationship instantly, you will be only pouring your old problems over\".  \n  \nI didn't even bother answering, didn't want to get cruel towards her, I told her friend about this and she cut contact with her in a matter of days saying that she couldn't believe the hypocrisy and that two-faced, disrespectful behavior.  \n  \nYou might be asking yourselves: what's the moral?  \n  \nI didn't give up on loving people, I still want to help them as much as I can, started volunteering a few days ago. I think the moral is: no matter how shitty life or others treat you, no matter who they are, don't lose love for life and people. I was close to falling back to hate, way too close, probably closer than I ever was my entire life. Never had I had my heart shattered that badly, my psyche that confused, but I also met people with same or worse sicknesses than her and they would never act the way she used to.  \n  \nI know it's a bit of a stupid story, but I just wanted to emphasize that there are people who genuinely love you for who you are, even when you might not be well or great, even when you are not too nice to others. There will be people along the way, good people, ones that will make you not feel alone ever again. Sorry for writing too much, I felt strongly about sharing.",

        "Origin_reddit": "I do not consider myself as ever having had depression, but issues of conformity vs individuality, agnosticism/skepticism and romantic love vs. unconditional love for humanity have turned me to a dark place over this winter break and today during the first day of school. \n\nMy relationship between me and my parents isn't close where we say we love each other, make physical contact, or talk a lot, and I fear it is my fault because of how difficult I was in the past possibly, and I also just don't feel love, give love, or subscribe to the idea of love much, only to helping people for the sake of helping people. I guess emotions really are a weak spot for me as an INTP. Many people upon meeting me have noted that I'm very cold and aloof. I was feeling angry at them recently for going against what I believed to be my personal and innate way of living, but now I am not sure. Today at school my teacher said \"how are you\" to me and this girl who had been bothering me for a long time, who I would get angry at but I had never talked to, who seemed to keep smiling at me and looking at me subtly as I would also look at her because I wanted to know what was going on, turned around slightly when she heard that and probably smiled. I still don't feel sure about her intentions but I think she was employing satirical techniques, which we just learned about in class today, and she is in my class, to try to prod me in the right direction, seeing how lonely and disconnected I was. (TO PUT ME OUT OF MY EGOTISM AND WEAK BUT DEEP TOXIC SENSE OF COMPETITIVENESS.) Today in psychology my class also started learning about motivation and emotion, and that was eerily attuned to my situation, because in the past few nights I didn't have motivation to do the work I needed to do, so I failed to do it. I also was going through a lot of different emotions. \n\n\nI keep getting sudden feelings that my life has just significantly changed, like today, and I feel like I am so stupid and I don't know how I was able to feel normal before, how I could be blind to it, but it is just so confusing. I find it kind of hard to look back on the past few months and remember what I was thinking. I see myself as just kind of having been a zombie in the past.\n\nSo I felt very stupid today, and I was going through my classes in an obviously different mood, which I now regret because I think I looked weird in front of one of my teachers. I kept seeing different ways how I had failed to accept love and integrate it into my life, and how I was nothing without it, how I was such a failure in so many ways. I was considering seeing a school therapist, and I talked to the few friends I had about the day's events, causing stress for them probably. I was skeptical of the idea of love for a long time though, as I wanted to study it in psychology before deciding what to do on that subject, and I kept feeling like I should only love certain people, and not really like or dislike other people but just want to help them when possible. I was always very individualistic and recently I had this silly thought Satan would visit me one night because I could relate to Lucifer. I didn't want to put my faith into anything, not some god or even unconditional love really. But we trust our intuitions all the time anyway, and I don't know what to do. It might just be a kind of unnecessary and bad thing to care so much about being skeptical of everything, and doing so could be egotistic. I have had the idea in recent times that maybe I could completely get rid of the ego and not care how I did compared to others, only focus on being the best I could be. And I don't think that was an idea I didn't accept, I think I accepted that idea.\n\nI should note I had loving feelings for a teacher I have and I was scared to ever interact with her besides just being in the class, but this was something I was holding on to and I had feelings of wanting more of it. Not being able to love makes me feel guilty all the time, and I think I was labelling my problem as not being able to make friends and being lonely but really it was not being able to get and give love with friends and people. I couldn't make friends because I didn't have the right view of people.",

        "Origin_reddit": "Earlier during dinner, my parents were discussing an acquaintance whose son was recently diagnosed with cancer and is currently undergoing treatment. Due to my (secret) lack of willingness to live, I said something to the effect of: \"If I was diagnosed with something horrible like that or even a terminal illness, I wouldn't do anything about it. I'd refuse treatment.\"\n\nOf course, like most good parents, they didn't like the idea of their son choosing to die in a situation like that, so we began arguing back and forth about it.\n\nIt got pretty heated. I was trying to express that everyone should be allowed to make that decision for themselves and have that decision be respected. I still stand by this, of course, but I've always done much better with written words than spoken ones, and so I wasn't able to express my point very clearly. My emotions easily get the best of me, and it's really hard for me *not* to argue, even if I simultaneously believe that arguing usually hurts more than it helps.\n\nAnd then, despite the argument getting a little more than heated, my dad calmly said something to the effect of \"I understand why you'd make a decision like that, but as your dad, I'd try my hardest to change your mind anyway. I'd never just let you kill yourself. I'd do whatever I had to do to keep you around. I don't know what I'd do if you were dead.\"\n\nI got blindsided by that, and I was almost in tears. I could see it on his face. He was truly, deeply terrified of the idea of me not being around. He wants me to live and be happy. For the first time in a long time, I was able to differentiate selfishness from somebody actually caring about me.\n\nAfter dinner I spent the next half-hour alone, crying in my bed. My parents have no idea about the depression and anxiety I've suffered from the past six or seven years and how I think about killing myself every day, and how much it meant to me to hear that someone actually cared about my well-being.\n\nI've said some bad things about my parents behind their back, and I feel bad about that. Really bad. None of this is their fault, and I need to do better not to blame them for it.\n\nRealistically, I'm not sure if this changes my situation much. It was a simple reminder that there *are* people who care about me, people that are going to be really hurt if I commit suicide. Up until now, this never mattered to me. I was entirely selfish about it. I can't explain it, but hearing and seeing the concern my parents had for my well-being just *made* it matter, I guess. Maybe I do have a heart after all.\n\nFor all the time I've been on this board, I don't think I've ever made a positive post, and I just really wanted to share this with somebody. I actually feel a little better, a little more stable after today's events. Thank you for reading.\n\nEDIT: Thank you everybody for responding. I'm glad this resonated with all of you. I'm going to push myself to be more open with my parents from now on.\n",

I have nothing against them, nor can I fault them for this however when I hear things like \"getting girls is easy\" or \"I can't believe you're never with a girl\" like it should be easy for me. I feel I'm a social guy, I go to parties, drink at the bars, and hang out with my friends every weekend, but at then end of the night I go home alone. It's not for a lack of trying, I try to dance with and talk to girls but being short and asian almost always leads to immediate disqualification in their eyes. I get a lot of \"I have a boyfriend\", \"you're not my type\", even \"I'm a lesbian\" i've heard it all. I'm constantly described as a nice guy, and I genuinely believe myself to be as such but the constant rejection night after night crushes me. It feels like I'm playing my life on extreme difficulty, and its constantly weighing on me.\n(-as a side note I have dated a girl, and we did have sex a few times but it ended rather quickly and wasn't anything serious)\n\nrecently I got some real shit news, there was a problem with my transfer of major some 2 years ago. So I found out at the end of my second semester senior year that my transfer into the neuroscience program never went through and since then the required GPA has risen from a 3.0 to a 3.3. As a senior my current GPA sits at a 3.04 so it would be impossible for me to raise it to a 3.3 with the amount of credit hours I have left. As such my only option would be to settle for a psych degree, and I would have to take additional classes. I would not describe myself as a naturally smart person, so I have only survived as a neuroscience student through effort and hard work, something I have always forced myself to do. My entire life I have believed that if you work hard enough things will go your way, however now that I'm faced with this situation I have found out that all the hard work that I've put in for the past 8 years (since start of highschool) has been for nothing. I have all the required classes for a neuroscience degree but administration has told me theres nothing I can do so tough luck. So now the only thing that I have any real pride in has been taken from me and I don't know what to do. \n\nDepression has always been something that I've battled with for the reasons stated before, but it has never felt heavier or more destructive than it does now. one of the most memorable quotes that I have ever heard is \"Suicide doesn't make the pain go away, it just gives it to someone else\". This has always resonated with me, and has always kept those thoughts at bay, but lately they have become more and more real. I don't think I could ever do it purely based on how it would destroy my family but I'm wake up every day hating myself. \n\nHonestly thank you to anyone who listened, this is something I have never told anyone, but I needed to tell someone about this monster I'm fighting. \n\n ",

        "Origin_reddit": "I created a throwaway just to tell my story. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure what else to do at this point. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so upset I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sleep, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything productive, and have nowhere to vent my frustration and no one to vent it to. \n\nStart with a little about me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a 38 year old female. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been suffering from clinical depression and anxiety for many years now. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried treatment, but that only makes me more listless and tired, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really trying to self medicate with vitamins and exercise, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always do the trick. My first thought every morning when I wake up is to put a bullet through my brain. Thankfully, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t own a gun, and probably don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the balls to do it, but nonetheless, that is my first thought every single morning. But every day I drag out of bed and continue to live, except for on my days off, in which I rarely make it out of bed, and if I do, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just to drink for awhile.\n\nNow a little back story with what I am dealing with tonight. I fell in love at first sight about 25 years ago. Many things happened that made a relationship impossible, and we never acted on our feelings until about 8 years ago. At that time, he had a girlfriend. He left her for me, but due to sticky circumstances we never officially got together (aka living together, etc.) We did spend a really great few years spending almost every day together, travelling a lot and falling in love, or so I thought. Things came to a head after a while, it was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cforbidden\u00e2\u0080\u009d relationship from the start due to the aforementioned sticky circumstances. \n\nAbout 5 years ago, he met someone else and fell in love with her. She is a very possessive, controlling, manipulative type. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gotten his head so twisted up, there have been times he has wanted to commit suicide, and comes to me. He went almost a year in the relationship without telling me at all. Once I found out, he continued to break up with her (or her with him) every few months for a week or so and would spend it with me, just to go back to her and drop me like I was nothing. She is a horrible person. From the very beginning I tried to be cordial with her, because I never blame \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe other woman\u00e2\u0080\u009d when a man cheats. But she treated me like \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe other woman\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the start, even though we were together first.  As a matter of fact, her first words to me ever were to taunt me saying she \u00e2\u0080\u009chas my man all the time\u00e2\u0080\u009d. At one point during one of his suicidal episodes, I sat right next to him as he texted her saying he wanted to kill himself, and her response to him was \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo it\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nThe last year or so, the break ups have waned, and we honestly have not seen or talked much at all. Our split broke my heart, and I was really just starting to get over it, starting to \u00e2\u0080\u009clearn to live half a life\u00e2\u0080\u009d like the song goes.  \nTwo months ago, he called me and asked me to take some time off over the holidays because she was going out of town and he wanted to spend a few days together. At first I was reluctant, because in the past we only ever did this when they were broken up. But I agreed because I just miss him so much, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even describe it. I knew I had to end it, but my plan was to spend a last few days in happiness with him then to tell him to let me go. Let things end on that note, give me some closure at least. \n\nSo I took some time off. He called me a few weeks later to tell me he had the dates wrong, and I even went so far as to change my vacation time (even though my boss is not open at all to that sort of thing). I got new tires, got the car serviced so we could take a trip. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really been the only thing keeping me going the last few weeks, knowing that I was going to be happy for a few days. \n\nWell, the time comes to take the trip. He calls me the night before, telling me he will call me when he wakes up and we can leave. The next morning, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m packed, just waiting for his call, could not even sleep the night before because I was so excited. \n\nThat was yesterday morning. I still have not heard a word from him. I finally called his phone tonight and another man answered, saying he was him. Of course I recognized the voice and knew it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t him. The man asked me who I was and when I told him my name he said I have the wrong number and hung up. I have sent him a couple of messages with no reply.\n\nSo here I sit now wondering how I let myself fall for this, how I let myself go so far out of my way and get my hopes up so much just to be crushed. Again. I wonder if he did all this intentionally just to hurt me, or if something came up, maybe she came home early. I know I have no right to be upset because it was I who was planning on running away with another woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man, but I am still upset. Devastated. So let down I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to do with myself.\n\nI know whatever the outcome, a day from now I will be in the same situation I would have been anyways. I would have ended it for good, and still will, but I guess I had in my mind how that was going to go, and this is not what I had planned. \n\nI just need to know how to get this weight off my chest, this lump out of my throat, how to force myself to eat or even get out of bed (except to drink which makes it worse). I thought about using the rest of my vacation doing something productive, but I seriously cannot even. I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand why he would do this to me. I never asked for this, he planned it all, just to let me down again. And for what? And I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even yell at him, because he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak to me. Half of me just wants to tell her everything just to get revenge, just to hurt him too. But I know that will only make me feel worse. \n\nI wonder what I ever did to be treated like this. I wonder how I can keep living. I was in a very bad mental state before this, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid this might just put me over the edge. I guess I just needed someone to hear my story.

Why was I born this way? Why am I hated so? Fine. I give up. I wanted to go into more detail but i've wasted enough time and I don't wanna type no more. Sorry......",
