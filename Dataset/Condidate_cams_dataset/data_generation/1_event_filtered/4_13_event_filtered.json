Or like things that were supposed to excite you made you anxious/embarrassed? \n\nFor instance, I hated going on vacations with my family. I did not find them fun at all. I hated going to amusement parks and field trips because everyone around me would be having so much fun and I just couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I rarely got excited on any holiday except a little bit on Christmas because it was the only time of year when everything around me seemed to calm down and people seemed to be genuinely nice to each other. I never thought my birthday was a big deal and never wanted parties, even though I had a good amount of friends. I just feel like this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t normal for a kid and maybe I am actually clinically depressed, BUT I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A DIAGNOSIS. ",

I've never been depressed, never been in a relationship. After she broke up with me, I realized how pointless my life now is. I was working 10 hours days 6 days a week so I could support us. I was working for us, we were talking about getting married. It was a bit early but we were set on having kids. The thought of having a kid and family to take care of motivated me so much. And now that I don't have that I feel so pointless. It caused a lot of philosophical questioning in my head about life, and I don't even wanna be alive at most times. Some days I feel so positive, some days I think about jumping off of a bridge. It's been 6 lonely months, without a job, now living at my dad's while he's constantly pestering me about getting a job. I've posted on here so many times and people keep telling me just to move on and hangout with friends but it's not that fuckin easy. I have 0 motivation to do anything and I feel so pathetic.

While doing that she would sing along to a song, calling me a coward and a weakling. \n\nShe also saw me develop my eating disorder but never said anything untill it was too late. I've lost a lot of weight since then and come a long way but she never fails to rub it in my face. Even if I eat an apple as a snack, she would tell me to \"Watch the line\". \n\nThese are just mere fragments of how she is towards me. Recently, I was talking to her about life partners. She flat out told me that, if anyone were to love me, they'd have to choose it very profoundly because I make everyone have a hard time.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I did have a rebellious teen period. I just don't know why she can't get a new image of me? Does anyone have tips on how to survive this passive agressive fiesta my mother has?

        "Origin_reddit": "Hey all, sorry for the upcoming long-winded post but yeah, I'm feeling so down the past few months.\n\nAll started when my elder brother moved in, but before that, a brief background. I remember I used to have dreams of a particular job; well-adjusted, motivated. All of that ended when my eldest brother turned tail on me and accused me of selling secrets to a third-party, which I never did, but knowing that I might have wronged him, I apologized in a semi-self justifying way. That was my mistake, and of course he never accepted it. He was also backed by his wife and his wife's family over his decision to accuse me.\n\nI looked up at him like a son would to his father, and his betrayal wrenched my heart so much it still hurts inside.\n\nMoving forwards, not even my elder brother believed me, and kept telling me to admit my fault, in which case I never did anything. I also felt betrayed, but until the fateful day he was kicked out of living with my eldest brother, he didn't believe me and I rather liked living a pointless, solitary life with depressed me and my aunt. I didn't feel alive, but neither did I feel so utterly dead.\n\nNow, when he moved, he's kinda bossy; the type to demand respect and not earn it. He forced me to find a job which created pressure and friction to my ego, because while I knew I was getting nowhere, I also needed the job, but he kept berating at me and my uselessness. It further spiraled my depression. This was the 'first' phase. Knowing full well nothing would go well with our permanent arrangement, I found a job at a colorless call center, which while greatly paying, stole all life I had on dreaming and hoping, and painted me an utter cynic. I only looked for the high of getting pay, feeding myself, and of course, pretending I was well while I was abused by customers. This of course continued until it was bearable to a point, but I was transferred between accounts. This shift in the playground furthered my lifelessness and having been moved to Comcast, because fuck Comcast, I handed my resignation and left the company. I found a job in sales, but the accumulated cynicism in the last 6-8 months killed whatever ability I had to close a sale. This was my fault, and no sooner than 2 months they kicked me out. I felt... free and semi-happy after that, ironically. It was shortlived, because I am fretting at the lack of funds I have (rather I built up some savings but I don't have income; that's distressingly worrying).\n\nThe call-center depression was over and I initially steeled myself to finding day-shift jobs. But, whatever happened, I wasn't able to find a job; due to circumstances, I can't *not* declare my 2 month stint because it would reflect on my taxes and I could get kicked for that. So I had to justify myself to companies who weren't really biting it. I don't want to go back to a call-center, but I guess I would still have easy entry over there.\n\nThis brings us to now. My elder brother is berating me for a lack of jobs, and when I ask him for advice, he basically tells me the obvious 'just get over it, be positive, yadda.' If I knew how to do that, I wouldn't want to stay being depressed. Then he throws me the bomb that I should shut up because my negativity was affecting him, and he wants to stay positive.\n\nI feel massively betrayed and not too long ago I wanted to scream but it's the early mornings; I'd rather not. So I now feel incredibly useless, because I can't find a job I can tolerate, I feel non-functioning, all I do is worry other people and emit negativity, and I can't really help myself in any substantial way. Not even faith is helping me; it's even preventing me from dying because I'm too scared.\n\nI feel so utterly useless and defeated, and I keep wondering why, if there's a protector watching above, why would they allow this? And I am so stretched apart I feel pained all over. Hell, basically all I do is mull over important decisions without deciding on one.\n\nI feel so useless; and while I would want to visit a psychiatrist, I don't have the funds to maintain it.\n\nI just wish I knew how to help myself. I'm still attached to the shadows of my past I can't move on to find better things.\n\nI wish I didn't exist to trouble other people. So, apologies for having you listen to my rant; I have no idea what I was hoping to achieve here, looking back.",

Since high school, however there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a lingering perpetual sadness and loneliness.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been the person that connects well with other people. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had small groups of friends and a lot of times I have trouble finding a deeper feeling of a strong relationship with those people, like they are surface level. \n\nThen there was a girl...\nI met her freshman year of college and quickly we were together and happy. Whenever I think of times where my sadness and anxiety was completely irrelevant to me, it was times with her. Our third year of college, though she went abroad and broke it off. She tells me how she felt codependent with me and needed her independence, but loves me. This was the first of multiple times this has happened, and I fell into a very dark place. \n\nShe came back, though for senior year, and we quickly got back together, the way things were.\n\nWhen we graduated she wanted to move to a new city she fell in love with when interning for a summer. I had opportunity in the city we were in, and so we went separate ways. We stayed in touch for a few months until, for the second time, I got a call with the same speech I got when she went abroad. I thought that was it and I would move on. Sad, but I needed to try. I dragged through my life bitter at the place I was living and the thin to non-existent relationships I had with people. I even dated someone a few months later, but I was never happy with her, yet I stuck with it and got broken up with again. There I was, hurt by someone I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care too much about but at the fact I was alone and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find a relationship quite like before. \n\nNow to a few months ago. A friend of both me and my college ex catches up with her unexpectedly when she was in town for a few days. She tells them she thinks about me sometimes and what could have been...and that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be happy if I got in touch. I pounced on this opportunity. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go into this expecting anything to come of it other than companionship, but as before, it fell back into how we always were together.\n\nA month ago she calls me upset. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another guy where she is living and is torn between me and him. She tells me to \u00e2\u0080\u009cclaim what is mine\u00e2\u0080\u009d and if I moved closer to her she could promise me we could try again. I tell her how I feel and what comes out of it is a trip to see her for New Years. I go to see her and I have never felt less depressed in my life. Being with her made me want to actively try to live happier, healthier, and work harder. \n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to leave to come home though and both of us are anxious about what will happen. The day came when we had to talk about it and basically I felt like I needed to make a big play. It was either going to work, or I would go down knowing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d try. I told her how I felt when I was with her and that I was willing to move there and work everything out. I told her I loved her and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I want to take a chance for......all I received, was for the third time, was indecisiveness and doubt. She said she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willing up everything she built from scratch in her new City and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to fall in her old feeling of codependency. I felt defeated and lost.\n\nI know this was a long post, and I appreciate anyone who made it this far. The conclusion is I have never felt more alone and isolated in both the lack of relationships I have and the place I live. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m at a point where I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where I belong or the purpose I serve, and the girl I loved I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t good enough for, which feels like it transcends to everyone I put an effort into. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking guidance or just anyone to listen, but all in all, thanks for reading. \n\n",

I've been 'unhappy' for roughly 3 years (I've refrained from calling myself depressed since I haven't actually been professionally diagnosed with anything since I'm too afraid to get help). I don't feel like waking up anymore. I wake up briefly, then sleep until 3 in the afternoon. I haven't been going to sleep until 4:00 AM at the earliest, because I lie there and dwell on the dumb things that I've done in the past, think about the the things I'm afraid of for my future, struggle with my crippling loneliness-- I just can't fall asleep instantly.\nI don't feel like eating. I have no appetite. I'm losing weight when I'm already too thin. Because of my social anxiety, I've isolated myself from everyone I used to know-- and now I have nobody. I'm too emotionally attached to a group of people that will never even know that I exist, so much so that the thought of them being gone someday completely breaks me. My feelings have only gotten worse, especially over the last two months. I've cried so many times over the past few days. I haven't taken care of myself at all.\nI don't think I'd ever bring myself to take my own life, but the thought of randomly being put out of my misery seems so refreshing.\nBut I'm too afraid to speak up about it to anybody.

I'm posting this on am account I've just created because if I get through this, I won't want other people to know I've written the post.\n\nI've spent this evening preparing the place where I would hang myself. It's a storage room, at the top of our building. I've made a mess in order to leave space around the hanger in which I used to hang my bike because it's the only place where I think I can accomplish my purpose of ending my life. I've cried whole oceans of tears while doing, however, I was willing to do it. I swear I was, I was extremely afraid of what I would feel while hanging, but then I thought again about my life and came to the conclusion that it was worth it. However, I went down to my house in order to go to the toilet, eat, etc. (maybe those were just excuses set by the survival instinct?), saw my mother and cried again. I ended up having dinner with my family, doing some house chores and I can't hold my tears anymore (Actually, I've had to go out a few times so they didn't notice). I might be alive tomorrow night or might not; if I am (because I'm unable to hang myself), they will discover my hanging set-up because we will be putting away the Christmas stuff in the storage room. \n\n(sorry, now I can't think clearly, I can't share with you everything I'd like to, so I'll jump to the end right now)\n\nWhat would happen if I told my mother? I know it might be the help I need to continue living but life we'll never be the same. I hope she doesn't freak out in the moment, but even if she wasn't, I don't want her to be worrying about whether I would try to commit suicide again, searching on the internet  \"how to help my teenager suicidal son\", if I would try to hurt myself with a new knife that she has bought or , if I would jump off a high building when I get the chance. Also, there might be some times in my life in which a psychological test is needed to access a new job or opportunity. What if due to my mother they find out that I've been/am suicidal?

I've been terribly depressed before due to my other break-ups, but more than one year ago, I met this beautiful girl (let's call her Sara) who changed my life.

That she has made new decisions for 2018, that she completely changed. She explained how her love for me is simply leaving, and that's it.

Literally convinced me I had imagined seeing his name pop up on her phone, I suppose to cover up the fact she was doing something not very nice to the person she was supposed to marry.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just so tired of feeling like this. ",

I haven't had a good steady job in months.\n\nMy step dad that claims he loves and cares about me hasn't taken any time out for me at all since before my divorce. I lived in that house, alone, for six months. Not a single person came to visit me. Not one.\n\nRight now I don't really see anyone. No one ever takes the time to really spend any with me. I had a girlfriend but her and I just broke up. I was told that I wasn't sexually attractive to her and that because I had to no car and no job she wasn't as attractive to me. *sigh*\n\nI just don't want to live. I've lost so much in my life and feel like I've gained nothing. I really really wish I had a car and some help, but no one cares.\n\n",
