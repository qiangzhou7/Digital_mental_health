I'm just feeling really shitty at how I seem to have spent the majority of my time recently lying around not doing anything, letting my room and shit get into a mess and just been consumed by negative thoughts.

I'm 17 and wasting my fucking life being lazy and doing nothing, the new year has made me realise. I want to make resolutions but I know I can't keep them so I'm not bothering.\n\nAny help/advice??

It all started with me crying imagining what would happen to me if my parents died on public transport. My mum instantly comforted me and told me that wouldn't happen (I'm 13). I continued on to yesterday which as you all know is New year's. I started getting even more panicky thinking about what happens after life and that if I die is that it? I solved that by reading some theories on after life and forming my opinion that we go into a sort of lounge with the spirits who wait for us. After that I've lost all ambition to become an entrepreneur and just thinking of what point is there to life. I've been able to get myself out of the panicky state only when watching youtube or playing video games. Any other time I end up being highly stressed for some unknown reason.  Please reddit help me  ",

Last night though at first I was fine and everything was cool but it got to just after midnight and I got this overwhelming feeling that I should leave.\n\nI have been feeling low for the past couple days and just felt really anxious and upset on the day of NYE. My mood had slightly picked up before we went out but once we were there I just couldn't escape what I was feeling. My girlfriend was naturally really upset and couldn't understand why I wanted to leave. After having a bit of a row I just yelled \"It's because I'm fucking depressed!\" and left by myself. \n\nI have feelings of guilt - obviously I know she wanted me there but I let this mood I'm having control what I do. It must have looked strange to everyone and I feel like I wasted the night and an opportunity to have fun. Having said that the feeling I had making me want to leave was so overwhelming I wouldn't have enjoyed myself at all.\n\nThis scares me - this hasn't happened before, I am usually a sociable person and enjoy having fun with my friends. For the past couple of weeks though I've had this feeling that I just want to stay in bed and do nothing - finally last night I acted on it.\n\nIs this depression? I really can't tell if I am or not and it worries me that this behaviour might be the start of it.",

I don't like doing a lot of things, when i start a new project i either fail or i lose my interest after a couple of weeks and i just give up.
