The fact that I was stuck at number 28 online and when I called the 800 number I was put in a queue somehow helped me. It was ridiculous that I sit here with a gun in hand, desperate and looking for a reason not to shoot myself. I was hoping for someone to talk to, but when I get stuck in a queue and start thinking more about what I'm doing, it did actually help me. So, once again I help myself. For this moment, I haven't actually pulled a trigger, but I still think about it every single day. I would like someone to talk about that to, but as it is, I'll take a brief internet vent. I choose to post rather than shoot....for today........",
