When I do go for periods without drinking, I think I feel better. So I guess I just wanted to maybe hear from some people who successfully either cut back or cut down altogether, and how this has affected them. Also, if you have any tips, it'd be greatly appreciated. I almost feel like I'm addicted at this point.

I can't remember the last time I was truly happy, and most days I think that I will never be happy again. Hating my life has become a usual thing for me and thoughts of killing myself are very frequently occurring now. Just want to vent a little and see if anyone has any advice at all for me. \n\nSocial anxiety/generalized anxiety has affected my life for as long as I can remember. Self-confidence has always been an issue and has been a barrier in making friends/maintaining the few friendships I do manage to make. I have had periods in my life where I have had a close group of friends to spend time with but I never seem to be able to make lasting friendships. Most of those friends have gone on to make other meaningful relationships in their lives and I was not able to continue being a part of it with them.  On top of this, my family is currently pressuring me to find a girlfriend and get married but since I have not had any relationship with a woman in the past, I have no idea what to do and this is now adding to my anxiety (they tried to introduce me to some girls but I blew all of the chances from lack of experience). I constantly worry about the fact that I am a virgin and no woman is ever going to want me because of it and I also have issues with self-image (hate looking in the mirror sometimes). The loneliness turned me on to porn a long time ago and now I think I have an addiction; I am ashamed of this and feel hopeless because I can never talk to anyone about it out of embarrassment.  \nEven for the less embarrassing problems, the 2 members of my immediate family are dealing with a lot of stressful problems of their own and I don't want to continue burdening them with my issues. \n\nAlso, I am currently enrolled in a university program that requires a lot of social interaction when the only thing I feel like doing most days is isolating myself and staying in bed. I feel like the weird guy in my class because I just don't have the energy to socialize and make small talk and even when I do, my anxiety makes it so that I babble on like a fool. It is getting to the point where I am making excuses to explain my absences and I am afraid I am going to fail out of the program or succumb to the immense pressure by doing something irreversible. \n\nBasically, I hate myself and I just wish I could escape from being me for a while. Getting out of bed is becoming more and more of a chore everyday and I feel sad, ashamed, hopeless, and tired. I am pretty sure I am depressed but with my intense school program I just don't have the time to address my issues. Anyway, if anyone read my rant and has any advice it would be greatly appreciated.

        "Origin_reddit": "Hello everyone.\n\nI've never actually reached out about my wellbeing before and don't really know how to, so I guess I'm just going to lay it all out on the table.\n\nI'm 24 and I graduated college about three weeks ago, and I think there may be some thing or things wrong with me that I was ignoring as I gritted my teeth through my generally painful and unrewarding five-and-a-half year college experience. To keep things abbreviated, all I'll say here is that during that short time I had three major medical catastrophes (one of which will persist for the rest of my life), I was stalked for 7 months at one point, lived with an abusive couple, and had several family deaths. All of these negative stimuli gave me the opportunity to hand-wave my mental health difficulties as par for the course. It almost goes without saying, but my GPA was decimated by these experiences (my college has a terrible medical withdrawal system and as a result I have never taken any medical leave).\n\nI would say I was \"doing well\" during my last two semesters (although my definition of doing well still involves a constant fog of anxiety and sleep issues); I was pursuing my interests relatively aggressively, making probably a B+ average in my classes, exercising 3x/week (this stopped a couple months ago), etc. During my final semester I was even working two part time jobs while taking classes. I still had these constant discomforts that I chalked up to school and proximity to recent hardship, but now after a few weeks of unemployment and no school I'm starting to think I'm incapable of enjoying myself in a healthy way (or at all really).\n\nI have diagnosed ADHD and have always struggled in school, but in the last three years have really had to teach myself how to learn and devote myself to my studies. As a result I have learned a lot, but I also have lost a lot of my sense of identity. I haven't had a girlfriend since I was 17, and have only been on one date in the intervening time. Additionally I have dropped essentially all of my hobbies, and my latent avoidant behaviors that have always subverted all of my efforts have become more and more disruptive. For instance, just tonight (it's 3:30AM where I live for context) I spent two and a half hours in my room while uncomfortably hungry in order to avoid interacting with my room mates (with whom I have no problems or stresses). After two hours of waiting, I compromised by grabbing a protein shaker and just walking to the kitchen while nobody was looking, rinsing it out, then making a protein shake with milk from my mini fridge in my room. It may seem like a silly example, but this kind of thing is reflected in every aspect of my life and I can't keep living this way.\n\nFor the last seven years (at least), I have also been bothered by a weird intrusive tick that I'm deeply ashamed of. I call it a tick, because it's not really a thought. It makes me cringe to even write it out, but for the longest time as I go about my daily forgettable tasks whenever I'm alone (or I'm at work and think I'm alone) I'll just mutter to myself some variation of \"I'm going to kill myself\", \"I'm going to get out of here\", or \"I'm going to wake up.\" It's a lot like a hiccup; it comes out quickly and unexpectedly to the point where I can't even stop it until halfway through the sentence, and even then it's like cutting off a stream of piss (it basically requires me to hold my breath in the middle of a sentence). One of my deepest fears is that someone I know will hear me saying these things one day, although at this point it seems almost impossible that nobody has yet. I've only told two people in my life about these things, and I consider both of those conversations a major life event; they were about four years apart.\n\nAll of these problems seem to worsen when my sleep is bad, and my sleep is always bad. I have utterly given up on being a well rested person and am a hostage to the vicious whims of my body clock. Now that I am not forced to wake up early, it's gotten even worse. I can't bring myself to even start projects that I'd been telling myself I was only putting off for school. I am hanging out with friends, but still constantly wonder why I am not doing more with my time, or at the very least actually enjoying myself in my leisure. School and work were hell, but free time is suffocating. I don't really understand why my life has come to be this way, but this seems to be the way that it is.\n\nI'm worried that I might be about to enter (or maybe already in the midst of) a shame induced downward spiral. I'm not normally the type to do hard drugs, but in the last two and a half weeks I've dropped acid five times. This doesn't seem to be part of the problem however; I'm weirdly unaffected by these trips and am not having negative experiences from them (although I think I'm done for now). Simultaneously, my family is falling apart and my parents are talking about divorce over my sister's out of control decisions. Among my family and friends (most of whom also struggle with mild to serious mental instability), I am usually considered the one who \"has it together.\" This is part of the reason that I have never sought professional help, along with a strong, quiet kind of discouragement of that sort of thing from my family and society as a whole.\n\nFrom the day I finished my last exam I've felt this indescribable, seeping apathy. I don't know how it's possible to feel apathetic and panicked at the same time, but I seem to have pulled it off. Maybe it's more like paralysis. In any case, I can't seem to do anything constructive, I haven't been exercising, I haven't been looking for work (I applied for hundreds of jobs over the last semester), I have neither done anything stressful nor for even one minute felt relaxed. I'm always surprised when I am hungry, but if I really scrutinize my day will often find that I haven't eaten for 18+ hours. The worst thing is the underlying truth that nothing has changed and I was always like this. I can't believe I graduated at all.\n\nI have enough money to last three months in my current living situation. In two weeks, I'm going to start applying to food service jobs. Although I have a BS in computer science, I feel that at this time in my life I am not cut out for a real job or really capable of contributing to anything, but I'm such a leech that I'll continue pursuing a career-type job while working in food service anyway.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nI guess I'll wrap up by saying what I meant to say in the first place: I'm worried about my life. I can't remember the last time I really enjoyed something, and I am incapable of pursuing things that will make my life better. I'm afraid that my poor self esteem and self hatred will lead me to start making actively self-destructive decisions, and I don't really know where that path will end because I can't tell the difference between misery and happiness anymore. I don't know what to do about any of these things and honestly I can't see how posting this will help either, but I feel like I need to do something and I guess this is something.",

It was deppressing, my supervisor used to call me worried about my situation I was all the time the last one delivering work assingments, was changed of department becauase of my low productivity. etc\n\nAfter that nightmare ended, I came here to Europe to study, a new begining, no it was not like that, I still have the same problems, and discovered MANY MORE, i am not organized, (nor do I know how to be organized) I do not know how to manage my time, I do not understand the more practical assignments such as econometrics, I do not know how to write a fucking paper, everybody does, everybody understands, I am socially arkward, I dissapear into the people talking, I am not handsome, I hate my body.\n\nI want to end my life, I reallly want to end it all right here, but if it were not because of my parents, my 2 friends and my SO i would not be here. I am affraid of cause pain to them. But I cannot stand it, I hate being the shitty stupid good for nothing kid, during this master I have left classes, got bad grades, and as usual, the last in the class in terms of perfomance or reliability.\n\nwhy? Why does it happen to me? I really struggle to be better at what I do (I must admit I do not like my career) but no results? I really struggle to understand concepts, theory, processes, but no avail. I do not get better, and it hurts, it hurts to try it one more time, I am affraid to be dissapointed of myself again, I am affraid of feeling that sensation of not being to do something. I dont want to feel like a failure anymore I just want to stop existing. \n\nTL DR: I want to kill myself but wont do it, I am not good at anything or anything and has never been. ",

        "Origin_reddit": "I was diagnosed with mild depression which then got worse and I've been on sertraline since August 02 of 2016 (50mg) and recently switched up to 100mg. I really thought this would help with my depression, but so far I feel like shit. I've been depressed since March of 2014, I'm not sure what triggered it but it slowly crept up in a few months into 2014. On March 19th, my computer was caught by malicious software and I don't know why but it sent me over the edge - I couldn't function, I stared into space and I felt so dead inside. I spent months meticulously removing myself from everything from the internet, keeping core programs and user accounts fro some things, but over those years I cried and my family got sick of me quickly. For context, before my trigger, I had friends that I had met online and became good friends with. We spent days chatting and telling jokes, and I didn't care what anyone else thought of me. I was quick to retort if someone angered me...but now I just feel so empty inside. And I just left them. I removed all trace of myself from our chats, I upset them and I upset myself. I spent months processing what was happening to me. \n\nIn fact, I spent my birthday removing my old skype account and removing people from it. Since then, I've over compensated for what my brain considered 'a failure in social ability' and now I try so damn hard to try and fit in. My anxiety sky rocketed - if I think something rude or harmful about someone? I have to literally walk backwards and tell myself that this wasn't going to happen and that I needed to shut the fuck up. And then I kept walking on.\n\n\nI used to love videogames too. I recently purchased Battlefield 1 (50% off, hoo boy) and I was always fascinated by war, and they dids a good job. But I'm always examining things..for example, I feel like very business is out to get your money (which in fairness, they are) but I feel like it is malicious attempt to undermine me.\nI always look at things and people and go 'Oh! I wonder what their next attempt to screw me over will be?'\nI have one friend at the moment. All my other friends bailed on me as soon as we went our separate educational ways - I went to college, they didn't. And they talked about me behind my back, even those who did attend college with me did this, and I was so fed up with these to faced spiteful shitlords that I called friends.\nBut now nothing makes me happy - I shrugged at Overwatch (its cool, and something I try to play, but I just feel like I'm not good enough, and that this games is meaningless in real life.) And I just can't play games. I haven't got the attention for it - I can spend 20 minutes watching a youtube video before I have to move on. I have the Skyrim Special Edition on PC, and I really want to play it, but I feel so alone when I do try. I can't immerse myself, I feel way to aware of the real world, and that I should be doing something productive with myself rather than waste my time on a 'videogame', but then I hate everything outside. I hate businessmen, I hate self entitled people, I hate false people, and I don't know what to do!\n\n\nI like buying stuff. And this is nearly self destructive as I find myself broke all the time, and I buy stuff I don't necessarily need, but randomly crave. I really want to save for a movie authentic Stormtrooper helmet from EFX though. (They are very cool.)\n\nSometimes I think to myself 'ignorance is bliss' and I want to be someone who doesn't have to be so aware, and I know it sounds super snotty, but I feel like sometimes I'm too smart to be happy; I'm shitty at Mathematics, but I did well in English literature and I like to tinker with electronics. But sometimes I think about things that I don't believe most people my age (16 by the way) will do anytime soon - I like thinking about philosophers and I've been meaning to reads Sun Zhu's 'Art of War' but I know I won't actually do it.\nSometimes I feel like the things I do (act smart, own a bible because it looks cool, act grumpy and mysterious) is because I want to impress. I want people to feel sympathy for me because I'm a 'broken figure' with a 'dark past' and a hidden vulnerability that I am all to careless to talk about.\n\n\nI've never had a girlfriend. I've been close and I've been close to people, but I don't think I could stick it out - opening myself up to another person, show how weak and vile I really am. This affects me in my daily life too - I have a thing for Daisy Ridley (as do 99.9998% of men on planet earth) and I'm sat there like 'man, how cool would it be if me and Daisy were a thing! Y'know, long walks on the beach!) and stuff like that. I know its a tad creepy but I'm 16 and my hormones are wack out of shape.\n\n\nI've had suicidual thoughts, but not really enough to make me want to go further. I overdosed on sertraline once, (however, I wouldn't call 200mg of meds as opposed to one 50mg anm 'overdose'.) But everyone was so angry at me.\nI was once kicked out of my house in May (29th) 2016. I took a sleeping bag and a warm jumper and ran to the church near my house, and I stood on a wall and watched people walk by. I phoned a friend (who recently bailed on me) and he invited me to stay for the night. (No one has ever done this for me, and maybe never will again, and I tried so hard to make this friendship work but ultimately failed.)\nI also argue with my family so much that sometimes I feel like a sociopath has taken over my body - a snarling beast of a man whose intent is to exert power and rule this small house. And I snarl and laugh at the people I live with. And I don't hate it. I feel justified sometimes, and I've been called a 'sociopath and psychopath + countless more by own mother.. But I don't blame her, we are very alike and I would do the same. My siblings have told me to kill myself multiple times between them and called me a 'monster'.\n\n\nFor exercise context, everyone says 'aww yeah, do some exercise, you'll feel better.' (Yes I know about endorphins) and for more context, I am a certified 1st degree Black Belt Taekwondo Martial Artist from April of 2015. (Nearly 2 years now, jeez...) I used to love running, but now I'm a little more porky.\nMy dad has never lived with us. He left just after I was born, but I see him sometimes. He bought me my first motorbike in 2016. It was consequently stolen. And I wasn't angry. I felt nothing.\nIn my family, my great uncle (lets call him Uncle Bob) killed himself. it's not something I should talk about, but when its something I consider on the daily, I don't think an old memory is a large price to pay (yes I'm an asshat.) I know this is pretentious of me, but I've felt like jumping out of my window so many times. Thats it. Done. Game over.\n\nI also have a problem with meaning, or should I say I have a problem with believing in one - I'm a self called nihilist, and can't help but believe the world was created as a freak accident, and we are just a byproduct, that there is no God, that we all die and are forgotten. It is pretty cliche, but I identify quite easily with Rick from Rick and Morty and Greg House from House M.D. (Everyone says they do too, I know.) Also, I really want a cane. For walking. At 16. My mum says it would be embarrassing, but my legs are usually terrible and a cane wouldn't be merely cosmetic for me, I think it would help (Should I get one? :/)\nI just feel like shit all the time. And suicide wouldn't be difficult for me to do, it's just I don't really want to. I'm in limbo.\nHelp me please.",

I've been on a variety of antidepressants over the years, and it seems that when my medication is not fully working I get this unwell feeling in my stomach. I'm not sad or unhappy, and it isn't emotionally triggered, there is just this awful feeling my stomach. It's not an upset stomach, it just feels unwell, and it changes my mood because it's all I can focus on.\n\n I was on Brintellix for a year and was a miracle drug for me after a year of finding a medication that worked. Symptoms then began about 3 months ago in the form of this unwell feeling in my stomach. We increased the dosage and symptoms went way with the change, and that lasted about 3 months until now. I'm now on Effexor wth mixed results after a month and a half. I take 75MG in the morning but the symptoms arise around the early afternoon.

I have been since medicated with prozac, and it helps. I don't feel nearly as hopeless, I don't feel worthless, I feel like me, before all this stress.\n\nWell last night, about 11pm, I had an intrusive thought, that I should just die, and I should just get it over with. Now to be fair, I had a plan IF I failed second semester, which I did not do. I even just came home from the area I would do it in. I commonly have thoughts that wonder what my eulogy would be, but honestly I attributed that to my natural curiosity. \n\nThis thought, it felt different, it felt real, and it scared me. I felt odd, my BP shot up, my pulse plunged, I felt short of breath but my o2 saturation was normal. I monitored it every 15 min, for an hour, and when it wasn't changing I took myself to the hospital. It was there that I realized what had just happened. \n\nYou see, I am a migraine sufferer with a rare condition, my migraines are rarely painful, most just a headache, but the auras, they fucking SUCK. My first one ever mirrored a stroke, my second one I went partly blind for an hour, with all of them I had a change in how I talk. \n\nWhen I opened my mouth to talk, for the first time since feeling this way, I realized it was a migraine, but I was scared. I had a thought that I have had once before in my life, and it was terrifying to me. My voice sounded robotic, like something you would expect someone having severe asthma would talk like. My tremors were exacerbated where it was difficult to sign my name. They take me back, and all my symptoms are still there, and I am put on suicide watch while they page the psychologist. Here I am, 30 years old, some people consider me the most stable person they know, when I told them that I started antidepressants the general comments were along the lines of: no surprised you would be willing to reach out for help.  \n\nSo I sit like the fraud I am. Wanting to make sure I am medically OK, and mentally OK. I knew as soon as I had the invasive thought that I would not act on it, but it felt so real, and scary. Well turns out auras from migraines in depressed people can cause these thoughts. Fuck. Me. \n\nSo about 4am they discharge me when I tell them that I am not going to act on my impulse, and that I don't have a plan, and I will see outpatient. I feel like a sham, I am embarrassed, It felt like that wasn't me there. \n\nThank you for reading, and I hope we all can overcome this.",

The only logical thing I can come up with is placebo effect because you should maybe start to feel better after 4-6 weeks but I only seem to get better for 48-72 hours and then go back to feeling the same as before that. But if it was placebo, why has it only done that with those 2 medications?\n\nThe only other thing I can think of is that I have a different underlying condition that keeps counter acting the meds, but I feel like I'm just grasping at straws, but I'm sick of trying medications and the only relief I get is not wanting to die 24/7.

Not bi-polar, no clear \"type\". Probably would need a second opinion, which I can't afford right now (and not sure it'd be helpful- psychiatrists spend so much less time with patients than therapists- whom I prefer), and haven't found a free therapist/sliding scale one that I like. Only one I really trusted/got along with is way out of budget.\n\n-I cry at the drop of a hat. Certain things people say can trigger me (even if I know they had no idea it was a sensitive topic). Sometimes I emotionally and physically feel nothing about a topic and think I've gotten past it, and feel no physical reaction or feelings when it's brought up, but can still end up in tears. People's tones of voice can make me cry, even if I'm in the superior position (I.e. a high student today who I know has emotional issues and trouble at home yelled at me...It wasn't personal, he's just an asshole or takes out his issues on others...But I almost ended up crying as soon as the students left the room. I laughed to keep from crying in that instance but it upset the student and obviously was not the best coping mechanism- I did not consciously choose to do this by the way. I should have yelled back, but trouble is, when I feel angry/anger...I fucking cry).\n\n-I know this is a dopamine or seratonin issue in part because the SSRI I was on cut my crying to 1/5 of how often I cry right now (off meds almost 6 months now), and I only cried when I actually felt sad (I.e. a super sad movie, a relative in the hospital, I really hurt myself by stubbing my toe really hard).\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nPlease provide any resources that you can if possible. Or advice on meditative practices, or ways to trick my brain off of focusing on something that may trigger tears. I can't afford this affecting my professional life, as it's already affected my personal life (I hardly have made any new friends in the past year, all of my friends are from before I left school, and they were understanding because grad school is super stressful...But it's not normal to be like this now).\n\nThank you in advance.

Best 6 weeks ever. \n\nWhen she gave it to me she told me to stop taking it if the new med messes with my stomach too much.\n\nWell it did, to the point where any pressure on my stomach caused me pain and I would have to just lay down until the upset stomach subsided. I toughed it out for awhile because i felt so good but it just got to be too much so I stopped taking it about a week ago when it started making me vomit.\n\nI only have until next Monday until I see her again but everything is just awful. I feel like I'm worse off then before I took it and I don't know how I'm going to make it. Time is just dragging and every day is just awful. I find myself snapping at people and I just wanna cry all the time. It feels like when I wasn't taking anything.\n\nI haven't stopped taking my other meds just the new one.\n\nI just need a hug ;(",

        "Origin_reddit": "So I feel like it's sorta stupid to be making a Reddit about what I feel but to be honest no one else really listens to me it feels like, so without further delay here's my bullshit day in a nutshell. So before I give you a rundown on my shitty days I should let you know that I am in high school and have Touretts, not where I curse or anything like that but where I make weird movements, over my life I have been able to control these in most situations in front of people but lately it's been much harder. Every day I wake up and feel a lomming ball of sadness and stress as I get dressed and go to the buss. Sometimes I try to talk to some people but I find it hard because it's almost as if they only want to really talk on Snapchat and not in person. Most days I just pretend to be happy and try to remember all the random bullshit we need to learn in school (even though I don't understand why it's taught I still remember it). I used to get straight As in middle school but lately I've been getting Cs Bs and As (which I'm fine with for some reason). Anyway my parents usually scream at me about my grades even if there not that bad. they ended up sending me to a therapist because they said I was acting different And wasn't making enough friends. For some reason I kept lieing to the theripist  because I found it hard to describe my sadness in words. He ended up telling me that he was only a adult therapist and blew me off. I felt like I should have told him the truth but to be honest if he couldn't see that I wasn't telling it he was a shitty therapist. Ever scince then I've been going down a dark void that I can't escape (metaphorically of course) I still wake up every day depressed and my Tourette's is out of control even in happy moments I am sad and feel like I can't find happiness no matter what happens. I don't want to kill my self btw but I'm not afraid of dieing if you know what I mean. I also found this hard to right because there's so many more details I left out and sill couldn't describe my sadness I hope I did good enough to get you a idea of what I'm going through. ",

I have so little self esteem that I haven't even tried to find someone to go out with, mainly because I know that I need to be held so badly that I know I would just come across as creepy and needy. Just being diagnosed as having Asperger's doesn't help at all either. I have a very hard time reading emotions and connecting with people in the first place. Maybe I should just kill myself cause I will never find someone that can put up with my difficulties.",

        "Origin_reddit": "This is the most incredibly frustrating and scary time of my life. I have no clue what to think. I'm about to start my second semester at college. I barely made it through the first one. I had been on Zoloft 50mg and even got down to 25 mg for anxiety and depression. But during the later months of the semester of college. I got hit like a truck. I thought I was doing fine and adapting. But I guess not. I woke up feeling \"off\" and had acute anxious feelings about my well being and mental health. I've never really felt better. I feel empty. Lonely. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist  at school, and we upped my Zoloft to 150 mg with not much change in my mood. So now I'm on 100 mg of pristiq and have yet to witness any change. It's like this huge jumbled mess of what I call brain fog, anxiety, existential worry ( I just took two philosophy courses and have always been worried about life and death and religion), and depression. I'm so scared and sad. I'm trying to get better. It's like I'm trapped in my own mind. I dont want to drop college because I know it will hurt my future. I don't know why all of this happened so suddenly. It's like everything is contributing to everything else. I just want to feel better. ",
