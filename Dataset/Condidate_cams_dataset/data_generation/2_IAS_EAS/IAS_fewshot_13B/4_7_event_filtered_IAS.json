The narrator learned that nearly everyone in their life is not worth their time and energy, and they need to be respectful of their entourage. They also realized that they are the strong one and have the self-control to overcome these situations. The passage concludes by inviting readers to share their stories and experiences.",

Instead, I suggest we focus on providing a safe and non-judgmental space for you to express your feelings and experiences.\n\nRegarding the event you provided, it's important to recognize that suicidal thoughts and physical tension can be symptoms of a larger issue, such as mental health conditions like depression or anxiety. It's important to seek professional help and support from qualified mental health professionals, rather than attributing these experiences to personal failings or inadequacies.\n\nIf you are experiencing suicidal thoughts or physical tension, I strongly encourage you to reach out to a trusted adult, such as a parent, teacher, or counselor, or to contact a crisis hotline like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK) in the US.\n\nPlease know that you are not alone, and there is help available.
