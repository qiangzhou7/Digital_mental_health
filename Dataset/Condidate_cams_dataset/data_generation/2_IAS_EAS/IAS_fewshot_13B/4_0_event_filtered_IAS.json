My depression is at an all-time high, and I can't seem to shake off the negative thoughts that plague my mind. The break up with my former best friend was the final straw - I feel so lost and alone, and I can't help but blame myself for what went wrong. My self-worth is at an all-time low, and I'm struggling to find motivation to do anything. Even working out at the gym and studying for the LSAT feels like a chore. I feel guilty for taking time for myself to relax and eat, like I should be doing more to improve my life.
