I\\'m confident in so many areas of my life, but anxiety targets me and I become immovable. This is one of those times.\"\n",

There\\'s never a moment where it is completely silent and I know it\\'s anxiety and sensory overload, but gosh does it make me angry. My roommates talk CONSTANTLY and they keep me from being able to sleep because all I can concentrate on is their voices. Another example, in one of my classes today, my professor talked non-stop and she\\'s one of those extremely hyper, fast talking, off topic teachers who go off on tangents about things that aren\\'t related to the lesson at all. It was so hard to stay in that class without storming out because I couldn\\'t handle listening to her loud voice any longer.\"\n",

The police came and did all the investigation he could and I came to my hotel I'm currently staying at (I'm traveling right now-yes female solo travel can be dangerous lol), slightly scraped and shaken but no major injuries. The police weren't hopeful that they will get to find my phone with all of my not-backed up travel photos but at least I survived the day and I can get a new phone! Money doesn't concern me, I'm just really bugged that I won't have all of my photos from two-week travel. The thing is, I was scrolling through youtube to find phone reviews (so that I can get a new one and not regret it lol) and clicked on a video with a black male person showed up.\"\n",

I was given sleeping pills as I had not had the rest to let my brain consider recovery, and I was given lorazepam for the holidays so I could get out of the house to have Christmas with the family.
