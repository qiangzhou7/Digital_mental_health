It is possible that both internal and external factors may contribute to the event or experience you are describing.\n\nFor example, if you were let go from work despite your best efforts, it could be due to a combination of internal factors such as lack of motivation or skill, as well as external factors such as changes in the market or company restructuring. Similarly, if your painting failed to sell, it could be due to both internal factors such as lack of artistic talent, as well as external factors such as changes in the art market or lack of exposure.\n\nIn both cases, it is important to consider multiple perspectives and factors before attributing the outcome to a single cause.
