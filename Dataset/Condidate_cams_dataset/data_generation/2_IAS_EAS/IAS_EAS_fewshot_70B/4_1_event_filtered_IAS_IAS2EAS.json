This is an example of internal attributional style, where the individual blames themselves for their difficulties.\n\nIn the transferred post, the focus is shifted from the individual's personal failures to the external factors that have contributed to their struggles. The phrase \"despite my best efforts\" is removed, and the emphasis is placed on the impact of depression, isolation, and low self-esteem on the individual's life. The post also mentions seeking advice from a professional, which implies that the individual is looking for external help to overcome their challenges. This new post reflects an external attributional style, where the individual recognizes that their struggles are not solely their own fault and that there are other factors at play."
