The constant muscle spasms and abnormal posture, dystonia, make it hard to even walk. I'm trapped in a never-ending cycle of hallucinations, perceiving things that aren't there. My headaches are relentless, and the homicidal ideation that haunts my thoughts only adds to the pain. My body temperature fluctuates wildly, sometimes leaving me feeling cold and clammy, hyperthermia, while other times I feel like I'm on fire, hypothermia. Sleep is a luxury I can no longer afford, insomnia, and my mania, excessive enthusiasm or desire, only seems to make things worse. The paralysis that grips my body, leaving me unable to move, only adds to the sense of hopelessness. My mind races with thoughts of persecution, paranoia, and phobias, irrational fears that haunt my every waking moment. Even the simplest tasks feel like a monumental challenge, pyrexia, and the sciatica that shoots down my back and leg only serves to remind me of my fragility. Somnolence, a state of feeling drowsy or ready to fall asleep, is my constant companion, and the tics, involuntary movements or muscle twitching, that plague my body only serve to make me feel like a prisoner in my own skin. The tremors, involuntary quivering movements, that wrack my frame are a constant reminder of my fragility, and the weight gain/loss, increase or decrease in body weight, only serves to further destabilize my sense of self.
