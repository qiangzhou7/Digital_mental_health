Instead of letting feelings sweep you away, practice approaching them pragmatically.\n\n~Dushka Zapata\n\n.............................................................................................\n\nHow can you begin to live my life in a more pragmatic way?\n\nBasically deal with things in a sensible and realistic manner.**Be organised.** It is a simple thing to do and will have the most effective results in every aspect of your life, be it at home, in highschool,college, in your place of work.  A tidy life, will lead to a tidy mind which in turn will lead to you making better decisions when you need to be sharp, alert and on the 'button' when it comes to problem solving and taking action.\n\n**A confession:**\n\nYou cry and suffer alone. Nobody is there to help you. There is this form of helplessness that goes from you crying nearly every day, till you realize that nobody is there to hear you. Crying then becomes pointless.\n\nCrying is a distress signal, if the signal isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t answered, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s useless. So what happens? Well, your brain tries to find other ways to deal with suffering. As a result of nobody answering your distress calls, your brain learns over time that every single problem that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll EVER suffer from for the rest of your life, you must solve alone. Period.\n\nThe world has given us the middle finger and said \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoodluck dumbass, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on your own!\u00e2\u0080\u009d You learn that because nobody was there for you, you become 99.99% reliant on YOURSELF. You are now the only person you can trust. Everyone else means nothing to you. Why care about someone if:\n\n1. They weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever there for you, and\n\n2. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already learned how to be reliant on yourself, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need people anymore.\n\nYou develop this zenn state where you feel as if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a bit of an odd trance, like nothing really matters as much as you think it does and you stop putting emotions into just about anything.\n\nAs a result of your abuse, your problems stop feeling like problems. I hypothesize that the reason behind this is because when you were having problems, nobody was there to help you. There was no empathy for you and you were always left solving problems yourself.Eventually you just learn to cope with it by looking for solutions instead of self-loathing and whining about it because whenever they showed signs of distress, nobody was there to pick them up.\n\n~Jone Whistler",

        "Origin_reddit": "I feel like a hypocrite posting here, because I've only now started actually realizing I might have depression and I might've been fighting it for some time without realizing it, but today was a horrible fucking day and it got better just now. \n\n\nSo. I charged my iPad today. And found this account. I got into my post history, and surprise surprise, I find a thread from last year. I barely even remember making this post. But if you don't want to read it, generally I complained about having no friends and a girlfriend, I felt like I'm doomed to never have friends, I said I \"overcame\" social anxiety which I never did, and I felt like everyone was better than me. I wanted to quit my job back then, after only 2 weeks, because I couldn't handle the anxiety of working with others there (an anxiety I wasn't even aware of, by the way). \n\n\nI didn't quit. I kept working there. And you know what? Everything I wished for back then have come true. I made tons of friends at work. Everyone loves me there. To this day I hang around with people I'm only going to meet 8 months after making this post! That's crazy. My confidence has boosted. My self esteem has boosted. And the funniest part? I have a girlfriend. Back when I made that post, I had already met that girlfriend, I just didn't know how things are going to unfold. \n\n\nSo yeah, everything I wanted was solved. And with the solutions came new problems. Life isn't always fun or good, problems just keep coming our way. I wanted friends? Good luck learning how to handle and keep friendships. I wanted a girlfriend? Oh buddy. You're going to have to tackle your worst insecurities, fears and ugly sides of yourself because you're sharing life with another person now. I wanted more confidence? That just means I'm going to get out of my comfort zone more times, and believe me, the same fear is still here.\n\n\n\nWhat I'm saying is, to all of you sad mothercukers out there, the world sucks. Life sucks. I'm sad right now, the most I've ever been sad. I'm on anti depressant, go to therapy, and shit, there no solution in sight. I can't remember crying as much as I did today, ever. \n\nBut just know. All of you sad brothers and sisters. Know that it gets better. Wether you want it or not. Wether it happens in a month, year, or 10 years. Things change for the better. If the world can turn against you, it can also turn in your favor. You just have to give it the opportunity to do so. Non of us want to get out of bed, to work out, to socialize. I know the pain my dudes. But you gotta keep doing it, because the potential for things to get better is there if you only give the world the opportunity to do so. So give yourself the opportunity to feel better. Please. It's a new year. You don't have to be happy, you don't have to feel good. Both of those are the world's job. Your job is to stay hopeful. So stay hopeful, and let life do its thing. It will definitely give back one day. I feel like fucking shit today , but  the moment I press \"submit\" I'm going to brush my teeth, drink a cup of water, and meditate for 5 minutes. Because I don't have to feel good to tell depression \"fuck you!\" in the face. So fuck you depression! ",
