Seven years ago (seven?!?!) I realized that I wasn't mentally healthy. At the same time I was going through other stuff, was self medicating with weed, and had no direction in life. I had a massive breakdown/depression. Barely got out of bed, wasn't going to classes, couldn't even hold a conversation. I sort of pulled out of it but not much has gotten better.\n\nEver since then, i've been fighting the good fight but with little to no results. I've basically lost all of my friends or don't talk to them much. Even when I do i can't get past the fact that i went/still am crazy and can't just relax around them. Pretty much the same with family. They're more or less supportive but holidays and get togethers are fucking painful. I usually try to drink myself into being social with varying effects. \n\nI forced my way to getting a degree, even in that depressed state, because I didn't know what else to do. No idea how I can use that degree. I'm working a shitty job at a bank now and seem on the verge of being fired. I don't have the energy to grin and bear it. Depression is not great for customer service. I don't want to work at a bank. But i don't know what else I can or want to do. \n\nI'm so fucking lonely. I have no idea what to do with my life. Every day is a seesaw between extreme lows of depression and extreme highs of serious anxiety. \n\nI was against antidepressants but at this point it feels like I need to try something drastic. I tried Lexapro a while back for a few months and didn't notice anything change.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts? all this time and it still feels like I'm at square one.

        "Origin_reddit": "Two years and some change ago, I left the Marines to attend college and move my life forward. Even before separating, I had severe depression and anxiety issues that helped me make the decision to leave. Soon after I separated and began my coursework, my depression exploded to the point where I couldn't do anything and my anxiety to the point where I was terrified of leaving the house. I want from straight As in one semester to Cs the next because I could never make myself go to class, either because \"it wasn't worth it, I'm going to fail anyway because I'm awful\" or because I was terrified of being around people.\n\nI tried therapy. First, I want to a private practice where I was told that nothing is wrong, everyone who leaves the service faces this and gets over it eventually. She had no answer when I brought up the 22 movement, which infuriated me even more and showed me that I wasn't going to get help there.\n\nNext I tried the VA, which only made it worse. After trying to get me to wait for months (it took the therapist (or what I thought was a therapist at the time) calling to get me in her currently empty schedule), I go through months of weekly visits that go along these lines: I walk in, she asks how my week was, I answer and give her my journals she has me write, she asks for any clarifications needed (what does this word mean? who is this?) and then sends me home to write for another week. Nothing changed, nothing helped, she was basically just a living journal I recited my life to. Once I found out that she wasn't actually a therapist but a temp holding the position until they got an actual therapist (she admitted she didn't actually have the ability within the VA to do more than prescribe me low-level medications, which incidentally didn't include anti-depressants), I stopped going. She had noted that she believed I had PTSD but due to her temp position could not diagnose me as such within the VA.\n\nSo I tried for a few months to handle things myself and spiraled downward even more. Moving towards divorce with my wife (I wanted it because I finally realized she is a large part of my depression), I tried the VA again now that they had an actual therapist in office. Got checked in to the psychiatric system (didn't happen last time), so got a whole therapist/nurse practitioner/psychiatrist team to help me. Went great until I left to visit family for a month, things got worse with my wife and I isolated myself in my house again. Where they had me once diagnosed with PTSD, and thus my care and medication was free, I was sent a letter informing me I owed the VA for all my medication since I was no longer service-connected (they went back and now denied that my service had anything to do with my mental state).\n\nAdding to that, I panicked and dropped out of my courses for a semester and now owe $3000 to my university, effectively ending my courses and thus my GI bill benefits, which I was using for housing. With no money, I now had to get a job. That was August.\n\nSince then, I've applied everywhere from McDonalds to senior IT positions as long as I met the qualifications. No part time work has come through (only response has been Best Buy that told me four months later I was not getting the job), entry-level IT positions are worried that I am over-qualified and will leave when another company offers me a better position (every HR that has given me a reason for not hiring me has cited this) and higher positions won't hire me because I don't have my degree, even when it is listed as preferred in the job description.\n\nThe worst part was the holidays. Stuck alone with my soon to be ex wife and listening to what few friends I have left tell me how great their christmas was. I'm not about to have them stop, even though it just rubs in that I sat home alone over the holidays, because over the past year I've lost almost everyone I'd considered a close friend and I'm terrified of losing the two I have left.\n\nI have no idea what to do. Two months and I'll be homeless. And that kills me because I have a dog that I don't think I can live without (the only creature left that I feel truly gives a damn about me) but I'm not willing to take her to the streets with me. No job, wife's job isn't enough to pay for everything... I'm at a loss and every day something new gets dumped on me.",

I do fine with women generally, never had a serious girlfriend because I always lose interest in people and I prefer being alone when I'm not working because I find people to be exhausting.\n\nI have a cool apartment in the downtown area, I have a \"great job\" which people are jealous of, old friends hit me up asking for interview advice and references. I'm 23 and on my way to making 6 figures relatively soon.\n\nI did everything right, my parents are proud of me, everyone treats me well, and even more so when they know you're successful and have money, but that can be an entirely different post. All this doesn't even matter because I'm more depressed today than I ever have been.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with me. I have no true for ambition for corporate life, I find everything to be pointless and stupid, I'm really fucking good at pretending to be ambitious, and telling people what they want to here which is why interviewing has always been easy for me. But at my core, I don't give a fuck about anything, I feel like a zombie working from 9-7 every weekday to finally reach the weekend, have it fly by and then rinse and repeat. I really just want to do NOTHING, maybe read something I enjoy, play some video games, or find a new hobby or whatever but working makes me want to kill myself more and more everyday. \n\nDoes that make me lazy as fuck? Probably, I don't know, that's what I get told whenever I express discontent with the work life. I don't care about material things beyond a few necessities and some hobbies. If I had enough money to pay my rent and a little extra for the rest of my life I would quit immediately.\n\nMy only goal in life is to have enough money so I don't need to have anymore goals. Goals are bullshit, \"oh if I work really hard I can be the financial MANAGER in a few years and make more money, then I can get a cooler apartment or a nice house and continue slaving away until I'm an old man die.\" It's all just bullshit, who gives a fuck. Why would I want a job with more responsibilities which gives me more money I don't use, it all feels like a giant joke.\n\nThe only hope that keeps me going is somehow finding a way out and having enough money/passive income to retire, but the thought that it may take 15 years or more makes it seem useless. I feel like my youth is slipping away, I'm tired everyday, I have trouble sleeping, even my hair is starting to fall out which is fucking depressing.\n\nI have a few thousand in savings after sending money home to support my parents, with barely any free time or energy to find something I can invest in. I'm stuck working and watching time fly by week after week. It feels like a hopeless cycle with no escape, like no matter what I do I'm destined to working some zombie office job until I'm an old man until I can finally retire and die. I want to throw all my money in a business idea or something but with my current energy and time and mental state, I would probably fail miserably and lose all my money and go back to square one.\n\nEverything is depressing, I just want to disappear.\n",

I a'm a very quiet person, don't get much attention, and I spend all my time at home or at school.I'm 17 years old and tonight is my last day of Christmas break, and my last day of childhood since tomorrow is my 18th birthday (technically today since my birthday January 4th and it's already 1:50AM).I have spent my night drinking, smoking, and crying. The only thing I've been able to think about tonight is how dull and boring my 18 years have been leading up to this point. I haven't accomplished very much at all in 18 years and everyday i feel worse about it. Well I've made a firm decision to change my life tonight.\nTomorrow morning is my first day back at school, and my first day as an adult,after two long and lonely weeks of Christmas break. I've been ignoring my depression for a long time now, and I'm just now starting to acknowledge the reality of it. I'm already trying to get myself on the right path and basically this post is some sort of icebreaker to try and get involved in the community and to get some tips on staying positive, and some positive and insightful perspective on my life. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this. I will be replying to comments tomorrow after school, good night to everyone and I hope you all have as great of a day as I will tomorrow.\n\n",

They are the best people Ive met in my life so far and i would protect them with my life. i care for them a lot and would do anything for them.\n\nThat was 3 years ago, and of course, im still a depressed kid with friends. However, i think about killing myself on a weekly basis, and openly say that i hate myself to a lot of people. it has become common practice to say these things, like a shield to desensitize me and other people from mortality and the worse of the world. I also secretly hope that this softens the blow if i ever decide to jump off that overpass in my area. \n\nI want my friends, family, and everyone im connected with to remain happy and normal, so i put on that fake smile and pretend that nothing is wrong aside from the therapy that doesnt work. i value other people's happiness more than mine (for reasons that would make this post too long) so i keep on smiling and repress emotions until i walk into my room and shut the door. everyone i am connected with doesnt know im suicidal, i dont want them to worry about me, just to remain happy. and if i kill myself they would worry and get sad too, like me right now. i am living for other people because i dont want them to know the truth. i am a prisoner of other people. \n\ni just want to know what the hell am i supposed to do, and that im not alone in this world\n\ntl,dr: i made friends in high school and started to care about people in my life. but im depressed and dont want anyone to know that im mentally ill and suicidal because i want them to stay happy and not worry about me. so i live with a false smile on my face, and keep my emotions to myself. what the heck am i supposed to do?",

Everything is so seemingly random and purposeless.  Whenever I think about my life, I always feel so out of control.  I had no choice in my existence.  Everyday life without my distractions of fantasy..through games and TV shows..is meaningless and awful, yet I must participate to keep consuming the media that I truly live for.  I work and get education in an exhausting cycle every day..for an uncertain future in a VERY  fucked up and disgusting world in light of recent events.  How do I cope with the feelings of dread that wash over me?  I guess I'll try to answer for myself.  I just keep distracting, keep consuming media that gives my life interest and purpose.  Yet, as of late even that hasn't been enough.  I need the bigger distraction of other people I guess.  I want to socialize and build relationships to strengthen my life's meaning, but this is really, REALLY fucking hard.  Reaching out to people in today's American society is like jumping off a bridge in which you'll land on your feet or face first.  As an American, superficial and acquaintance relationships dominate.  The real struggle is to create something more.  I'm really afraid that my exhaustion will soon outweigh my desire to consume more media and the relationships I have by the time I have my BA degree.  I can just end the suffering, the pain, the world, MY world, at any time.\n\nThanks for reading, this has been the 3:30am ramblings of a high school senior with a part time job that has little free time and strong relationships in his life",

        "Origin_reddit": "Im sitting in my bathroom 1/5th deep with a belt wrapped around my neck just trying to get something out. I am generally a relatively passive depressed person. I feel like I am hyper-aware of my situation but I don't feel emotion like I should although I feel it welling up in me. \n\nWhy can't I cry? I feel like if I could ball my eyes out I would be fine after but I just can't do it. I am usually content with my emotions but probably once a week I get this feeling that I need to coax them out to get some sort of release. It's like there is this immense pressure inside me and all I need to do is turn a valve but I can't find the right one.\n\nI want to die. I am very close with my family which stops me, but only because I can't stand the idea of putting them through that. I understand that I am lucky to have people who love me so much but more often than not it feels more like a burden than a blessing. \n\nIm not super emotional that I want to die, rather i'm pretty passive about it. In my mind this seems a completely logical solution to my problems. I still love my ex girlfriend, I have self-esteem issues etc but at this point none of that really seems a factor to me. I have felt this way for a long time, much longer than my present problems are responsible for.\n\nI have friends who are enlightened as to my situation and they try to help but everything they say goes in one ear and out the other. I don't think I'm actually going to do it tonight. My mother always jokingly said that you should always keep your house clean in case you died tomorrow. I feel that way now. There are loose ends to be tied up before I did anything definite.\n\nIt would be so much easier. It frustrates me, no it pisses me off sometimes that suicide is considered such a selfish thing. What about me? What about what I feel? Is a life lived for other's comfort really worth living?\n\nI guess what scares me at this point is that the idea of suicide doesn't scare me anymore. I have my ideas about what might come after and I think it's eternal peace. Afterlife or not (veering towards not) I have the opportunity of eternal rest in front of me so why not?\n\nI don't know why I am posting this.
