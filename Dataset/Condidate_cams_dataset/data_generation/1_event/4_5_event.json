As for me, I just got divorced, my ex-wife is an incredibly manipulative narcissist, and we have a young child together. She's accused me of horrible things that I would never do in a failed attempt at full custody. I'm constantly battling her over our child. In the past she has successfully isolated and controlled me through guilt and accusations. She almost succeeded in manipulating the courts. The legal fees appear to be leaving me bankrupt. My thoughts are full of her, her constant false accusations and how to defend against them. I'm on a tenure track at a university, but that job is f-ed now because I can't concentrate on my research for longer than 5 minutes. So yeah, I'm kind of feeling down. My ex is abusive and is so good at it that the legal system and even women's abuse counselors will back her and protect her. I'm in therapy. Started going to church. Prayer helps me get back to sleep now. Trying to cut down on drinking. Exercising a lot. Still can't focus on work, so I'm now focusing on how to change careers and stay in the same area (close to our child.) What should I do? Am I suffering from depression? When this abuse and false accusations first started a few years ago, I thought about wanting to die. My career is f-ed now because of this. That makes me worry about future custody battles. In the meantime should I ask my therapist about depression medication? What's going on with me? Please help.",

But most of them either don't have time for me, or don't care for me as much as I care for them, are bored with me or are boring to me. I won't to make new friends, meet new people. But it's not just hard, it seems next to impossible. I know a few places where I can meet people that I find interesting, but there are several but's. One of those places is a sort of a board game parlour. But that's one place. And I'm afraid that if I screw that up I won't be able to come there no more, or I'll have to avoid certain people. I feel like I might lose those opportunities and be left with no opportunities. And that scares me. I'm scared of being hopeless again. Because it's awful to have no hope and know you'll never have any glimmer of hope again. If only I had a group of best friends I could rely on, sort of a safe net, someone that's always there. But there are no people like that in my life. Let's say friends are coffee mugs and my life is a table. Most of the coffee mugs are near the edge, some are even halfway over the edge, always in danger of falling over, all it takes is one false move. Talking to someone new is like putting a new mug right on the edge, half on the table, half over the edge. It's fucking nuts. I can't take those risks, I suck, I know, but I can't. I'm not very interesting (at first at least) or articulate and a lot of people find that annoying. Even talking to people on social networks is scary. I just hate that sound of a ceramic mug  breaking on the hard floor. Most people do I think. When something beautiful full of possibilities breaks. I feel like every meaningful and real conversation that I've ever had happened by mistake, by accident, with little involvement from me. And now I'm all out of happy accidents, and haven't learnt how to make those conversation happen on my own. I'm 24, virgin, never been kissed. I feel alone with no direction at life.",

I am a broken man who couldn't fix myself, even a little bit. I lost the person I love, and I have nothing else. All I want right now is people to talk to, people I can pretend are friends. All I want is to die or have my love back, and I can't have either. Don't be like me.\n\n\nThis is a direct continuation of the last part. My therapist and I were still getting to know one another and were communicating primarily through messages, as I wasn't really comfortable with more. Once we began having actual sessions, there will be bits and pieces missing that I really can't account for too well.\n\n\n\n&gt;  Hello ///// - Thank you for openly sharing your views about yourself, your beliefs and the relational history and status with your siblings. This could not have been easy, yet you did it. I wonder if the traumatic experiences you had made survival possible only if you were able to believe that you didn't matter. It's interesting because the very thing that you want to be able to give your partner is locked away even from you. I also wonder if doing things for the benefit of others is protective for you because it keeps you from expecting anything, thus never again being let down.\n\n&gt; ///// - I know that you talked about not having faith in yourself or believing in yourself, because if you did you would have done \"more than you have\". Your honesty and the truth as you see it is welcomed and valued in this space. Have you ever had the experience of losing something, beginning to look for it and then finding something else that was previously lost? Perhaps this is what will occur for you on this journey. It doesn't matter WHY you are here , only that YOU ARE and that you are WILLING to consider multiple perspectives on what may be going on inside of you that is impacting your symptoms, relationships and view of self. I have a suspicion that you are actually willing , you just need a good, sturdy, yet flexible and toxic free bridge to hope. This IS your time /////. This may be what you have been waiting for all of your life. Remember, the journey of a thousand miles, begins with ONE step.\n\n*Hello, //////.*\n\n*I don't know about it not being easy. For the people I actually trust, it is easy to divulge basically every thing. For those I don't, they will never know me. But I understand that it is vital to this particular relationship to forgo any subterfuge. If I had mattered to those who wronged me, they would not have done so. If I had mattered to myself, I would not have let those things happen. To say I was a child and knew no better stopped being a legitimate excuse when I turned 18. After that point, it's just been me fucking up without excuse. I know better, and I still keep fucking up. I don't know how to break myself from the cycle.*\n\n*I don't know if I agree with that last bit, because, even though my interest or intent may not be for my own benefit, I do expect to occasionally result in theirs. To make them happier, to make their life better, to earn a place in it. I have never been successful in the end. That is a crippling kind of failure, feeling let down is an understatement. I am, each and every time. When it comes to my partners, there's nothing I don't try to give, nothing I'm not willing to do. And yet it always seems that I don't actually commit to that, I always let THEM down. And then myself when that relationship crumbles. It is no less devastating each time it happens.*\n\n*I... Don't really know if I'd had that particular experience, no. I don't think I've ever really been 'looking' for anything, besides a relationship I can count on. I have stumbled blindly into and out of every relationship, every hobby or interest, every place I've ever been. I have never had a plan. I have always just winged it and saw how it turned out. The answer is, never really any good.*\n\n*I believe that to say you want something is fine, but to not follow up is proof that you do not actually want that thing. To say, \"I wanna go there\" and then NOT go there makes you a liar. If you really wanted it, wouldn't you have done it? If I really wanted to be in better shape, wouldn't I have done it by now? No, I just don't want to do it badly enough. This is the first and only time I've tried to follow through, and even then, I do not think it may actually benefit my current reason to do so. I think I may have damaged my relationship to the point it cannot be fixed.*\n\n*I'm more than open to other perspectives. For what it's worth, I know you're not wrong. I know the things you're saying are true. At least, the locked away part. The believing in myself, waiting for my time. I know you're not wrong in those things. I just can't believe in them, myself. I wish I could, but something keeps me from doing it. All that cliche crap about \"where there's a will there's a way\" and never giving up, some part of me really wants to believe it because I know it's a way out of this. I just don't know how to do that.*\n\n*I tend to ramble, by the way.*\n",

Even so, lately I have felt terribly depressed for the reasons I will make known a little later. Before, I used to be a very happy person, I had a girlfriend with whom we were about to be 3 years together. She was also my best friend, we did everything together and she did not need anyone else (besides, i did not have anyone else, but that did not matter to me, while she stands with me, i didn't need any friends). The thing is that at one point we broke, at first I was very affectionate, but I \"got over it\" quickly and I felt pretty good. The problems came when I realized that I did not know how to relate to almost anyone, I did not know who to turn to constantly as a friend, not as an acquaintance whom I only see at some parties. At first I did not take much importance, because despite not having friends, I used to go out at night quite often with different people. I went from group to group, everything was super intermittent, I did not stay with anyone constantly because I was not sure how to do it. Then, I reached a point where I started to get depressed slightly from time to time, like when I was alone in my house or went out to do everyday tasks, the fact of being alone and realizing it depressed me . Although I felt bad, it was not something that happened to me often (About 3 days a week more or less), but with time it became constant, I began to despair because I did not have anyone by my side. I tryed to make friends , but they all went away in the passing of days. So, I also began to feel as if people hated me, as if nobody wanted me and preferred to get away from me, as if I were a bloodthirsty. At this moment I do not know what to do, I have many suicidal thoughts, I do not want to get up in the mornings, I do not even go out, I stay in my house locked up doing nothing. The thing is that I do not know how to make friends, and that's killing me, loneliness is getting worse. I've really tried a lot of ways to make friends, but they all end up leaving me and that only makes things worse as I said before. I want to ask for your help, I want to know how you can make friends (Because i really have no idea how to), how to avoid this loneliness, how I want to go out and stop thinking about committing suicide, but most importatly, how to make friends, i feel like that's all i need.

        "Origin_reddit": "Prepare for a long read: \n\nIm only 15 years old so in comparison to most of you i probably have had it easy but i just need to tell my story for some advice because ive been feeling like shit. So lets start off with my past; my parents got divorced when i was 4 years old than my mother got married to another woman and my father also got married again. I went to my fathers house every weekend so i didnt really miss him but when the years went on that changed into 3 hours a week and i really hated the fact i couldnt really be around him. Then in the following 5 years my grandparents died which ofcourse sucked but i never really cried and just put all the emotions aside. When i was 10 my mother woke me up, she was crying and told me that my father killed himself lastnight. He called the day before but i didnt get to speak to him because i was playing in the garden with a friend and whatever i would go to him 2 days later. I cried for probably 5 minutes and then again i put aside my emotions. Also at his funeral i barely cried and it felt terrible but i just wasnt able to cry. Since that day everything went downhill and ive never really been happy. My mother told us that she felt like a man and she got an operation and now looks like a man as well. She and my stepmother than used a spermdonor to get my stepmom pregnant and i got a little sister at the age of 12. I never really talk with anyone about my situation so everyone just assumes that my mother is my dad and my stepmom my mother and ofcourse i cant blame them. Im a very shy, anxious and introvert person. I also aint that good looking but im very smart (i skipped a year and follow the highest possible level of education) and a lot of people say im funny so thats the only thing im confident about. I used to have some really good friends and as a group we were pretty close but then i skipped the year and went to a different class and the contact just stopped and i was alone. Looking back i think skipping the year was one of the things that fucked me up big time because i went from multiple good friends to no friends at all. I never got out of the house and never really talked with anyone. Then i went to high school(idk what its called but you go there when youre +-12 y/o) and one guy of my old class went to that school aswell so we kinda became friends but that died of really fast aswell. Since im pretty ugly and shy there has never really been a girl in my live that really talked to me or cared about me. But 1.5 years ago this girl from school randomly started to text me and it didnt take long till i got feelings for her we went on texting and talking for months and got really close. But eventhough a lot of people told me she liked me i couldnt believe that anyone would ever love me especially since and i never asked her out ot told her how i felt. She isnt really the best looking girl so i didnt really have any competition but she is still far out of my range. I dont want to talk about her too much so i just will sumarise it; went to her sweet 16 where i got drunk, knocked the fuck out and left out of shame in the night. We got close again months later i (unplanned )told her that i always liked her on fucking snapchat and she said she had to think about it. She never answered and im trying to move on and focus on school and work. But i just cant i miss the one friend i always talked to about how i felt and that was always there for me now she just ignored me and broke my heart in pieces. With the stress of school i was already feeling like shit and im really lacking sleep which is making it even worse. Not being able to talk about my emotions with her or anyone else really makes everything worse and my marks and mood are going downwards very fast. I would tell my mother but she has her own problems which she already barleycan handle so that aint an option and i really hate my stepmother so not even gonna bother trying. Especially the last weeks have been tough with last grandmother dying aswell. I didnt even cry when i heard it again i put the emotions aside and now its becoming too much. Christmas and new years eve were terrible and lonely for me since i didnt get invited to anything. Ive really been considering suicide that last few years but those thoughts became more serious last months. Im gonna break sooner or later and then everything will come out and i know it can be the end of me. The last days ive been wondering why i am alive and what my purpose is on this world and if anyone would really miss me when im gone. Any advice on who i can talk about? or how i maybe will feel better? or let the emotions out?",

What helped a lot was looking forward to watching sports, videogames, nice food and time with close friends. It helped, it always helped, but it was fleeting.\n\nToday at 33, I'm married to a gorgeous and wonderful woman. She really is a beauty, and everyone assumes she's a  trophy wife, except for that fact she's an engineer and has a very popular blog.  We have a wonderful flat, envy of many of our friends.

My wife and I together earn just over \u00c2\u00a3150K/year before taxes.\n\nWe travel a lot, workout a lot, eat healthily, socialize, sleep fairly well (at least 7 hours most nights)..........but that crippling sadness still lingers in me.\n\nI find myself sad and withdrawn a lot for no specific reason. \n\nIt's especially bad when I come back to my home country for Christmas and I see everyone I used to be close to seeming so happy and content without a care about me.\n\nRight now, I'm particularly down about how one of my friends has been toward me. I got him a one of kind (took some effort to find it too, had to get in contact with the band's tour manager) amazing item from his favorite band. We weren't able to meet before Christmas, but today I saw him and he opened the gift and showed little to know appreciation, barely looked at it and then was on his phone 90% of the time, barely asked anything about me or my life. Then left in a hurry saying one his friends wanted to catch a movie with him and he didn't wanna be late.\n\nNow that's a specific reason to be sad, but I've been very down recently and maybe it is my self esteem that's low too, but seeing how not just him, but so many people that I thought were important to me, have just ignored me. It hurts.\n\nI didn't mean to rant, it's just my lingering sadness is getting worse.\n\nI'm afraid to tell my wife, she's had mental health issues and is finally getting better and I don't want to set her back or burden her.\n\nMy best friend, the one who opened up to me about her depression, is my confidant right now and she is helping tremendously.

Neither time did I believe they were genuinely attracted to me and I am still not sure they were. I missed those opportunities to lose my virginity many years ago. Since then I have become uglier, fatter, and bald. I am so bitter and negative there is no way I will seem attractive to anyone, least of all myself.\n\n\nI could blame with the conservative and severely orthodox Catholicism that taught me to hate myself and my own sexual urges.

I've gotten drunk almost everyday the past few weeks (although I am sober writing this and have no plans to drink tonight,) I've been overeating, and I've cut back on my workouts which has caused me to put on a little weight (although I guess that's pretty normal for people around the hollidays.) \n\nI've also been overagrresive and snap on the littlest dumb things. I've been destroying my house, putting holes in the wall and kicking doors and cabinets. I've also been waking up in my sleep pissed off from a dream and hitting the wall. I even woke up and headbutted the wall two times in a row which makes me feel like an absolute crazy person.\n\nThis kind of behavior is absolutely not fair to my best friend who is always there for me, my dog. It scares the shit out of him, and he doesn't know how to react. It really makes me feel like shit.\n\nThe forefront of my depression I think is due to the fact that I'm lonely. I have a good close group of friends, but most of them live hours away, so were just not able to hangout too often. It just sucks having no one to hangout with in my off time. Im also longing for companionship, a relationship, just someone to be with in a romantic manor. Ideally I'd like something serious with a girl. I do get to hangout with a girl every blue moon, and I'm usually elated afterwards and feel happy, but then it goes nowhere which makes me come down pretty hard.\n\nWhich as I'm writing this I'm realizing that may be why I'm in this slump. I met this cool girl, we hungout and had a good time, and I let my hopes get up because I thought I might actually have a chance of something happening with her. But in the end it was obvious that she just wasn't that into me. Which is ok, I'm over it, looking back and getting to know her a bit more I realize that we wouldn't have been a good match. I just wish I could find girls to go out with more than once every 6 months.\n\nI'm just really lonely, I want someone to be with so bad. Someone that I can come home to and spend time with, and cuddle, and have sex of course, but all the other stuff is so much better for me. Of course, I know I have deeper seated issues than just loneliness. I also wish I would have accomplished more in life in general by now, being 27 yrs old, but I'm not gonna get into all that.\n\nI'm not suicidal, although I do think about it everyday, and do wonder if it would be easier to just end it all. But there's no way I could go through with it right now. I love my friends, family, and my dog too much and know it would destroy them if I was gone. I do talk about this stuff with my friends and I'm pretty open with them as far as everything I've written here. So I do have a decent support system, but there's only so much they can do.\n\nThat being said, I'm not really asking for advice, I know what I need to do to get better and I recognize my problems.

However, based on the context and the language used, the main Event that can be extracted is:\n\n\"Hating winter\"\n\nThis Event is unambiguously expressed in the sentence as the writer conveys their intense dislike for the season, using strong language such as \"malicious,\" \"sad,\" \"inconceivably difficult,\" and \"painful ordeals.\" The Event is further emphasized by the writer's desire to avoid leaving their room, talking to anyone, or doing anything that requires effort during winter."

I have wanted to kms since then, but never did it because I couldn't bear hurting people who care about me, even though at that point I didn't have many deep connections (cop out?), Now I'm 20, am needed to help my partner's mom make rent, working an internship that was specially made for me, and have been in a relationship for 2.5 years who \"didn't sign up\" for me being depressed but at least knows that I am in a dark place. I want so badly to kill myself. I am so depressed. I feel empty and hopeless and now I can't kill myself because people are actually relying on me now. \n\nI'm kind of just babbling but this is the only place I feel safe to be honest because I don't want people to treat me like a ticking time bomb. \n\nLast night (NYE) I got too drunk at a work party and made an ass of myself. I feel like a different person takes over sometimes and makes me feel suicidal and just generally puts me in bad situations in which I make messes upon messes. I look at myself in the mirror and don't even recognize the reflection as my own. I have to consciously fight to remember that I'm real. I get in my head a lot about how everything is subjective and nothing is real and it makes me feel so overwhelmed I could just drop dead.\n\nI feel like I live in a sarcophagus; my face and body is the fancy lid, but inside there's this entire other existence trapped and unable to control anything that happens on the outside. \n\nI spend so much energy just keeping myself from killing myself that I don't have enough juice to have any sort of discipline. Then when I act without discipline, I feel so guilty and ashamed and it makes me want to kill myself more. \n\nI've tried to talk to therapists and all of that but no one seems to get it. They just nod their head and tell me it will get better. It hasn't. And it probably won't. I think I am just destined to be sad and eventually kill myself. My depression is so enmeshed in my identity (remember it's been around for most of my emotional development) that I don't even know anything about myself outside of it. It's strange to me that most people to whom I speak about it aren't depressed. It's so normal to me that I am actually shocked by people who don't live in constant despair and darkness. Hmm.
