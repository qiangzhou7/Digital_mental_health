What if it is impossible? \n\nMy reasoning for thinking this is that what if my brain, on an evolutionary level, was simply not made to cope with all this stuff? Of course many centuries ago it really was survival of the fittest. If you were weak (mentally or physically) - you died. Nowadays with all these therapies and medications, I feel as if it is messing with my brain as it doesn't know how to cope with everything that happens and the medications that affect it.\n\nI know that brains have the ability to evolve and change its mind paths through neuroplasticity I just feel as if it is impossible in this case.\n\nCan anyone relate to this as I am feeling really down about this whole thing..

I know they are going to tell me I will have cavities if I don't improve, and that I ought to floss and use mouthwash and brush twice a day, but I don't have the energy to do that. Now my parents are going to have to remind me to do all that and it will embarrass me that I need to be babied as a teenager. I also have braces, so brushing and all that is already hard when I'm not down, so it's impossible when I am. This stinks.",
