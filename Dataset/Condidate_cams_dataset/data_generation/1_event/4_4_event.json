I can be supportive but aside from that, I can't say or do anything to change his mind. And I mean it's stressing me out mate. \n\nAnyways idk why I'm saying this or what I hope to achieve by it.

        "Origin_reddit": "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s currently 4 in the morning and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m feeling very stuck. I feel like nothing has changed since I can remember. For some background, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had depression since about middle school. I guess I still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if I want to call it depression since I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been diagnosed yet but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always just had trouble finding any positivity in my life. In school I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been popular but I could be considered as well liked. From what I know most opinions of me are positive but as I said that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s from what I know. My response to being sad has always been to try and focus on other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problems and try and help them. The problem with this is that all this has done is made me worse off. I feel like no one puts in as much effort into relationships as I do. Friends always seem to be eager to take my advice and then when I ask for help they run. The person I considered to be my best friend did this to me over the course of last year and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still sad about it. We stopped talking for a few months and today they invited me to hang out with them on New Year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Eve but, while I still care about them, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to put myself back  into a relationship where I put my all into it and then I ask for help and end up getting hurt. They tried to help me in the first 2 months that they knew about my depression (I feel like they actually did help me for the duration of the 2 months but for some reason that is hard to admit) and then after that he just gave up on me. That hurt more than anything else because I know I would never give up on him. In the absence of him for the last few months I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried to go to counseling at my school. That worked for a week and then after some work I realized I should get a therapist to help. The counselor had to call one of my parents because, being a minor, I have to get parental consent to get a therapist. She never did. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been about there weeks since she said she would do it. That really helps. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m stuck trying to solve my situation alone because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in it for so long that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve isolated myself from others. The point where I held a gun to my head and almost killed myself is when I think I finally realized something was very wrong with me mentality and I needed to do something about it. That was 6 months ago. Help feels like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so hard to find. My counselor hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t helped, my parents haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, and my past best friend hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I also have other \u00e2\u0080\u009cfriends\u00e2\u0080\u009d that I found security in and then I realized that they talk about me behind my back and make fun of my depression. They also make fun of the same thing with another friend of mine who is in that group and that pisses me off more then them talking about me. 2017 has been the worst year of my life. At least I learned that I need help but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been so hard to find. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made my depression worse and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m starting to lose hope again. In 2018 at the least I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to look at things more positively this year. All that I know is that 2017 has taught me that good help is hard to find. That is why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sitting here at 4am on a reddit account I just created venting to the void.\nThanks for reading my huge wall of text. I hope something in all of my rambling possibly related to you and helped a little bit. Good luck in 2018 and I hope this year works out for you. I know I need it to work out for me. Thanks again and have a happy New Year. ",

But I'm a very shy person, and never really liked the social scene. It makes it really hard to meet new people, but by a stroke of luck i met the most amazing girl back on September 30 2001(i was 18). We quickly fell in love, had a daughter, and got married. I thought we were a match made in heaven. I loved my life, i had everything i ever wanted. She made me want to be the best person i could be. I love this woman with every fiber of my being, but in early 2007 we hit our first road bump. She said she was unhappy and wanted a divorce. I tried everything to repair our marriage. I spent thousands of dollars on couples counseling, therapy, and spent every waking moment trying to resolve our issues. I found out 6 months into or troubles that she was sneaking around behind my back and sleeping with an old friend of hers from school(while we were still married). Even with that being the case, i still tried to fix our relationship because all i ever wanted was a complete family and for her to be happy. I guess her mind was made up though, because right after new years 2008 she gave me divorce papers. I love her and didn't want to fight it and cause her anymore stress so i signed the divorce papers bawling like a baby. The divorce was pretty much a 50/50 split but i let her take everything but our daughter and my PC, again because all i wanted was for her to be happy. Hell, i didn't even ask for child support even though i did everything for our daughter. I still tried to talk to her and let her know she was still very much loved, but soon after the divorce she remarried to the guy she cheated on me with. So, for the last 10 years i have been alone with just me and my daughter. I've tried to meet new women but i can't seem to find anyone that wants to be with me for more than a couple dates. I think it's because my depression, but i don't know. I haven't even had sex since 2007. I've tried apps and going to bars, but i don't drink alcohol so i feel awkward. I'm tired of being alone. I was raised by my grandparents and they have since passed on. I have NOBODY in my life that loves me besides my daughter. I want to find someone that can love me and my little girl as much as i could love them, but @ 35 years old it's beginning to feel impossible. Why won't anyone love me back? What is wrong with me? How can i find someone to love? I'm scared of dying alone. I'm worried my heart will remain broken till my death. I'm not a bad guy. I work very hard to make sure my daughter is happy, but without a proper mother figure i fear her life will mirror mine, and honestly if it wasn't for her i would've bitten the bullet years ago. She is all i have left. No siblings, no parents, no cousins or in-laws.

Just an interaction with another human being would warm my heart.\n\n\nTo cut a long story short, I've had this crush on a girl for well over a year now. Not a day goes by when I don't think about her and checking her social media accounts has became part of my daily routine. She lives overseas and there is a significant age difference, I'm 15 and she's 20. \n\n\nFor a few hours after I wake up, she's all I think about and it causes a nauseating feeling in my stomach. (Also, has anyone else been through this or know what it is?)\n\nUnlike most crushes, I recognise her flaws. She's passive aggressive, a humble bragger, a control freak, a spoilt girl who grew up in a mansion. But she's not an awful person, far from. I relate to her in so many ways. That's how I can see through her little act. She's insecure about her appearance and how people perceive her and has admitted to being depressed in the past. \n\n\nI only know her through her social media presence. But I'm certain I would make her so happy if I were her boyfriend. I'd take care of her, let her cry in my arms and vent about her problems all night. I'd take care of her.\n\n\nI suppose some things aren't meant to be, we live in different countries, we're different ages and she doesn't even fucking know me. Despite this, I can't just get over her and move on. I can't even distract myself, all I think about is her. Like I've said, I've been this way for years. Is this fate trying to tell me there is a chance or just my depression trying to beat me down and get me to get my hopes up?\n\n\nAnyone been through anything like this or know how to move forward? Also, sorry about the cringe-worthy \"I'd be good the best boyfriend\" speech I typed out earlier. I know it's so clich\u00c3\u00a9, but I think it needed to be said. \n\n\nOh, and happy New Years!",

        "Origin_reddit": "I started to think recently on how toxic my parent's behavior has been over the years, but since every time I tried to call them out they dismissed me I struggled with seeing those things as emotionally abusive, just a clash of personalities with them being overly harsh and me being overly sensitive, and I feel guilty since I know they love me and have always provided for me and that there are people that have much worse parents. I started to list out the things my father done, since they started earlier(around when I was 7-ish) than my mother's and I believe have been much more impactful:\n\n* Made fun of me to the ladies working at a clothing store's changing area because I didn't know how to tie my shoelaces\n\n* Yelled at me for spilling a soft drink on my shirt\n\n* Yelled at me whenever I got the answer wrong when helping me with math one time\n\n* Broke a game's cd rom in front of me because he could not figure out the puzzle\n\n* Yelled at me for throwing a soft drink can on the garbage at school because I struggled to open it and was too shy to ask for help\n\n* Yelled at me for letting kids at class use my empty water bottle to mix things different drinks in\n\n* Grounded me on summer vacation because my cousin was bossing me around but didn't say a word to my cousin or my uncle\n\n* Yelled at me in front of extended family in christmas and told me to go to bed early because one of the kids was bossing me around\n\n* Never tried to hide that he puts his siblings over us, said christmas without them is not christmas, and once we didn't even celebrated it because my mother wanted just the four of us at home and he got angry about it. Always antagonizes us when he's around his family and makes us feel like burdens and annoyances to them.\n\n* Told me I have shit on my head because I forgot to bring a coat when spending a whole day at my friend's house, never mind the fact that it was just two blocks away from mine and my father would drive me back.\n\n* Once me and my brother were bickering and I accidentally hit his glasses, he shouted so my father entered the room, yelled and made us sleep early.\n\n* When I came out I asked for a gender therapist or just someone with experience with trans patients, he got me a therapist who never had a trans patient before and was obsessed with having me remember the event in my childhood that triggered by dysphoria and dismissed my body issues because \"women have body hair too\" instead of actually helping me.\n\n* I found a gender therapist so I gave him her contact info and said I wanted to see her instead, he said he'd call her. Months after I asked him about it, he just tells me she's \"biased\"\n\n* Up until I was 18 he'd always force me to get a haircut once my hair was long enough to partially cover my ears, my hair was always thick and hard to manage and he always gave me shit about it. One time he thought I asked the hairdresser to just trim the absolute minimum and went on a fit about how if I wanted to cut my dick off that's fine but he was not going to be a part of it.\n\n* To this day he acts like me coming out never happened, the last he commented on it was years ago saying that I should study, find a job and then I can do anything I want to. I opened up despite how painful it was in the time I need his help the most and he just removed himself from that responsibility.\n\n* Mocked the way I speak by mimicking me in a tone of voice as if he was imitating a disabled person more than once\n\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf* He knows I'm scared of elevators since I'm 5 but always dismissed it, one day as a teen we were on one and the door kept opening and closing, it was fairly crowded with a baby stroller no less, I begged him to let us leave because I was terrified, he then yelled at me in front of everyone and told me he'd never take me out again.\n\n* Around the same time we were on a mall's bookstore, he showed me a book but I wasn't interested, partially because of being severely depressed, he flipped at me and ran to the parking area to leave, with the rest of us having to follow him. Then went on a rant all the way back home.\n\n* I lost count of how many mornings I woke up during a weekend to him washing the dishes while complaining at how much of a failure I am\n\n* Dismissed and belittled my concerns, fears and problems over the years always saying something like \"what are you going to do about it\".\n\n* Belittles my interests for being childish according to him.\n\n* Get's angry at me for being scared of bugs and other \"feminine\" attitudes.\n\n* Always makes me into the unreasonable one whenever I got visibly upset or angry at his behavior that he never apologizes for\n\n* Always acts like he knows me better than I know myself, always sees malice in my thoughts and actions because \"he was once my age\". He never believes I'm genuine with the things I want or do, I'm always doing things because everyone is doing it.\n\n* Constantly lies about things like pretending he took the dog to the vet, that he could not find something we asked him to buy, etc.\n\n* Always use us as his emotional and verbal punching bags when he's frustrated at something or someone\n\n* I always have to compromise, like not transitioning or always having my hair up now that it's long, but he never makes an effort to change or police himself on the things I've said that bother me over the years.\n\n* To this day whenever he raises his voice or get angry even if I have nothing to do with it I get panicky.\n\n* I feel like I have to walk on eggshells with him, if I say the wrong thing (speak my mind) or react the wrong way(react naturally) he's going to flip on me.\n\nI was close to my father when I was very very young but the behaviors I listed started happening around when I was 6-7 so it's pretty much since then that I started to become distant, he feels like a stranger to me since I was about 14. With my mother we were pretty close and got along very well up until I was about 14. She's always been an anxious and jealous person but the bad things that happened in her past plus a lot of stress over the years made her insufferable. On top of anxious and jealous she's controlling, critical and judgemental. If I don't do things her way she won't stop criticizing me, if I call her out she starts pointing out my flaws. She's always looking for a opportunity to turn anything into a fight and then play victim and make everything about herself. If I get angry at her she just says I'm crazy and need to go to a mental asylum. She told me so many hurtful things over the years since I came out, that I'm retarded, that I'm a curse in her life, that she should have been a whore instead of a proper woman, etc. I can tell she regrets it after as she tries to hug and kiss me but she never apologizes. \n\nI know deep down they both love me and want the best for me, they had always provided and praised me and done what they could but when it comes to the emotional side of things I think they managed to break me completely while being completely oblivious to it, always suggesting I'm \"tired\" and \"moody\" due to a poor diet and lack of exercise and wondering why I'm like this or why I feel so uncomfortable next to them. I'm severely depressed, have social and some general anxiety to the point I'm practically a shut in right now with no will to live, I get that there are things I could do do make my life better, I just don't see the point anymore.",

Recently it seems like I'm slowly going back down, and there's no incline in sight. If everything keeps going the way it is, I'll be farther down than I've ever been. When I was at my lowest, I was pretty ready to take my life. I felt almost a sensation of peace over myself knowing that soon enough I'll never have to feel this way again. I ended up not going through with it, and I talked myself away from those feelings for a good while, and I was feeling good. \n\nNow I have a kid on the way, almost halfway to the due date, and I'm going back down in the rut. It makes me feel like a complete piece of shit, but knowing that I can't just end it anymore is making it harder to deal with. In the past I've always had suicide as a plan if all else failed, and it made me feel a bit better knowing, if anything, it could all end. But with a kid on the way, I don't dare even think about it. I wouldn't want to have her resent me, or feel guilty in anyway, and now I can't seem to get over this feeling. \n\nOn top of it all, my wife knows of my depression, but overall it feels like it's just a burden to her.
