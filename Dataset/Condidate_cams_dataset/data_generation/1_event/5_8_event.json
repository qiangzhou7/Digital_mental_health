I have no one. Even that backup friend I never really liked in the first place, gone. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure how it happened. It was like one day everyone turned on me. Each situation and bridge burned is more baffling than the next. I feel like the universe is fucking with me.\n\nFor example: Last night my landlord and his wife called me together, bc I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay my rent. In California we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to pay rent until the following day if it falls on a bank holiday. When I tried to politely explain that a bank holiday meant I cOuld not go inside a bank, I received a twenty minute lecture from them both, (because everyone talks to me like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an incompetent female), about how everyone has to pay rent. \nThis resulted in my driving around to various stores to get \u00e2\u0080\u009ccash back\u00e2\u0080\u009d following a transaction bc due to daily atm withdrawal limits being$400 and the bank being closed, I had no other way to access the money in my account. So even though I went out of my way to do that series of inconvenient errands, my landlord was still had this to say: \n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have to say this is not how it should be and I will refrain from saying more.\nSo, it is very late.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTo which I replied : \n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI agree so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll refrain as well because this is also incredibly inconvenient for me. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why there is a law for this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrom this followed an incredibly uncomfortable in person exchange of cash. Now this where the baffling part comes in. This is what every day of my life had been like for the last six months. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one giant shit on Natasha fest where this dumb incompetent girl can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possible be right. ...\n\nAs soon as I arrive home from the exchange of cash, I receive a very agitated phone call from my landlord and his wife saying that I did not hand them the correct amount of money. Lucky for me, I had some downtime in the car before the handoff, so I had counted it so many times I remembered that there were 38 twenties 4 tens and one hundred dollar bill. So in the middle of the screaming I try to interject that maybe they could tell me what bills were there so I could see if maybe one dropped in my car. As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m asking reportedly for him to count the number of twenties, over the screams of his wife saying not to count it again because they did and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not there, he finally begins to count and shockingly, all the twenties are there. Then shit gets real weird. I start having to argue basic math. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m on the phone and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m speechless bc as most people with a calculator or third grade math know, 20 X 38 = 760. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m fucked. I am speechless. If they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to believe math, something essentially black and white, i might as well start speaking a different language bc nothing I say matters. \n\nEventually I could hear the husband starting to realize that maybe the cash did add up correctly so I gave them an out by saying maybe they wanted to call me back in a few minutes. Later I received a text saying, \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all here. Goodnight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNo apology. \nAnd so is my trash heap of a life. Empty. No human relationships. No money. No passion. No desire to get out of bed. And frustrated to tears. \n\nI hate crying. I spend everyday frustrated to tears.\n\nI wish I was dead.\n\nAnyways. This is my first post to an Internet forum. I wonder if anyone actually reads this through to this part. I know I would have skimmed and skipped a long time ago. Jesus even I bore myself.

When I was a young boy, gaming was my passion. I miss those days; no responsibilities and no meddlesome relationships to distract me from my pasttime. Now I'm much older and the depression hasn't waned a bit. Depression and responsibilities both grew. I got engaged a while back and, as happy as my partner makes me, I still have my personal fits of depression. This may seem cynical, but one person can only do so much for another. I wish I didn't, but I have accepted that painful truth. What really hurts me the most about my state now is that I can no longer truly enjoy playing video games anymore. As I said before, gaming was my passion. Now that I don't have any motivation to play as many games anymore, it makes me feel like I'm throwing my wonderful past with gaming away. I'm really sad. I just keep pouring my thoughts out and going on tangents. Sorry for this long rant. Thank you for reading this far.",
