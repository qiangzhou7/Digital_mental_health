She no longer talks to me. After continued (useless) therapy and meds, sobering up, and staying away from the knife, I was unable to prove to her that I had gotten any better. And I haven't. I cut off all my friends without saying a word because I knew that I would rely on them and that there was a good chance of another bad attack, and because I felt unwanted, excluded, and hated. After several weeks, I tried to reconnect with some of them, but they definitely want nothing to do with me. I feel ashamed that I've let my depression get this far.\n\nEven if they were to give me another chance, I'm not even sure how to be happy at this point. I know that I will unintentionally make them feel worse, manipulate, and push them away. I don't want to, but I become a really shitty person when I get close to people.

We were really close friends after we broke up and even made out once after, but after that she kind of ghosted me on everything because she didnt want to get back together with me. Its been a while since then and I kinda lashed out at her, which pushed me out of her close friend circle and into some ambiguous territory where she can talk to me from time to time (Nowhere as frequent as before) about random shit, none of it personal and deep like it used to be. She doesnt trust me anymore. I know Im supposed to move on from my ex after Im dumped, especially if Im still in love with her, but I dont have any close friends and my ex was my best friend when we dated too. I tried to go on without her for a while when she ghosted me, but I was in the darkest place I had ever been in, I literally was so close to attempting, since then I've reached back out to her and I've reached a state where unlike before, I can live life, but I have a very strong urge I will never be happy because she will never be with me again. \n\nSo we've been talking again for a day or two, a month ago, if she was active she would literally be texting me, she would tell me anything and everything, and that brought so much joy to my life. But now she'll talk to me about some random shit every few hours, seening my all the time like she doesnt really wanna let me in. But honestly, its better this way for my mental health than not talking to her at all. She often expresses how \"I still mean a lot to her\".\n\nI know through some sources that shes started to click with some other guy like we used when we first started dating and Im honestly so close to a fucking mental break down. Just the idea of her moving on already is like a fucking dagger through the heart, but if I stop talking to this girl I lose myself entirely right now. I dont know what to do, one of my friends died last night and that has put me in an even worse place than before. I would usually talk to my ex about it but shes pointed out (and its true) that I had a phase where I would go to her and seek attention and support and shes tired of it.

I don't know where to turn so I'm posting here.\n\nEver since my break up a month ago, it's been very hard to feel happiness.\n\nWe were together for more than two years and it was one of those relationships where we were very close. We depended on each other very much and were each other's best friends. I have a very hard time meeting people and making friends but I was totally happy to just spend time with her all the time. Literally my \"me time\" that I relished in before the relationship became \"us time\" and it felt good and right for me. We told each other we were in love before the relationship officially started and while I think the feelings of love morphed and changed and were periodically lost over the course of the relationship, she was always my best friend in the world. I trusted her completely and her company was all I needed.\n\nWe traveled all around together. Last summer we worked seasonal jobs in Alaska and then headed to the Grand Canyon after that to work through the winter. We had all these plans that I was so excited for and I was so happy to be able to have that experience with someone I was so close to. Nothing seemed off about the relationship and I trusted her so much I didn't think to question a new \"friendship\" with a guy she worked with.\n\nFast forward to a month ago and she wakes up one morning and tells me she hasn't been very happy being with me for a few months now and that she's developed feelings for this dude. I was totally shocked and blindsided. My entire world was turned upside down. Everything I enjoyed about life was suddenly gone and I was completely alone. She moved on without so much as a second guess like it was nothing. I found myself in a very shitty situation and I ran back home to my parent's house.\n\nMy self esteem is completely gone. I feel worthless, replaceable, unimportant, unattractive, and used. All the plans we made together are now hers and she's carrying them out with her new fuck buddy, like I was never even there. Everything I wanted for this winter is completely gone. I feel as if my life was stolen from me. These plans meant so much to me and they were suddenly hijacked. I feel like I'm stuck back where I started. My life has changed so much since I met her and I have no idea how to continue that without that type of relationship with someone. I want to get back out there and get a new job somewhere and travel again but I'm terrified to do it alone. Happiness is only real when shared after all.\n\nThe result is I've been severely depressed. I barely eat. I only get up to smoke cigarettes. Nothing at all that I used to enjoy gives me any pleasure. Conversations with old friends and family do not stimulate me at all. I cannot feel a single modicum of happiness. I feel either depressed, angry, insecure, or anxious at all times. I literally have not felt a single positive emotion since we broke up. It's been a month now. There are no \"good days\" along with the bad ones, there are only and always bad days. I strongly fantasize about suicide on a daily basis. I don't want to, and I doubt I will, but the thought of all my problems disappearing and not existing anymore is one of the few gratifications I can derive in this state of mind.\n\nAll I do is obsess over her and what she's doing and think about our old times and what should have been and go over every reason I hate her in my head over and over and over and over again. Today I sent her a million nasty texts to try to get under her skin and make her fight me. She just told me to go fuck myself and to stop texting her and that was that. I hyperventilated and got in the shower and punched the wall over and over and cried and screamed.\n\nI feel I am unwell and I do not know what to do.\n\nSorry for the long post.",

Diagnosed HIQ ( 144, with a IQ verbal/IQ perf rate = ~1,3 ) at the age of 10 and dealing with ego problems, i've been depressed the two last years because of hyper-empathy ( a fucked up word to explain that my exgirlfriend's rape's story traumatized me. ) and social awkwardness. ( I've got few friends that i've known since elementary school which i love, but furthermore, i have never been a sociable person. )\nSo, after those two years of moderate to severe depression, I've been going better the last three months, since i've definitely broke up with my toxic ex-girlfriend, but i'm recently going worse since i met this other girl.

Friends are great but it's more shooting the shit and screwing around than having sessions where i can just open up and cry. Even female friends of mine in the past seemed weirded out when i just needed to vent and share and break down a little. I have built boundaries that keep my self propped up on a bed of twigs to where i am solitary in what ever i am feeling. And when the weight is there those twigs snap and i have nowhere to turn. It's created i very unhealthy situation where it's all or nothing. If i open up i gush, and if i don't then you will never see that side of me. I'm sick of \"maning up\", sick of having to accommodate some bullshit notion that i can't feel. I was always a sensitive kid and i am a sensitive adult but perpetually hiding behind a mask of indifference which creates a cognitive dissonance on the basic story of who the hell i even am. When im \"stable\" im just living a lie i've been trained to live. And when im broken all the feelings i've suppressed come out and bite me right in the ass and boom i can't function anymore. \n\nHow can you create balance?  I feel like most people are able to ride both conforming with the world and expressing themselves in some kind of way that doesn't have to be at total odds with each other. Where when something triggers them, they don't fall into a state where they can't even take care of themselves. Obviously there is a lot to do with the fact they have a more balanced brain chemistry, and their threshold for pain is far higher but i still think there is something to this lack of balance that contributes heavily to depression in general. \n\nAlso, sidenote, as a man how in the hell can i find someone to open up to?

He would do the most random crazy shit he would punch a flat screen tv countless times for no reason, beat his girlfriend and bruise her, head butt her mom and scream and yell. One time he forced us to leave with his girlfriend at 12pm in the rain and we had to walk down the road until the cops came and  asked if we were okay. Things like this happened all the time. My bedroom was right under there's and I was forced to listen to them scream at each other and his girlfriend crying and screaming ,things getting thrown, her being thrown around and then having sex. I lived with them for 3 years and the final year I noticed a difference in myself. My room was kept constantly dark I would sleep all night get up and go to school and then come home and go right back to sleep when I was up all I could do is read for hours or watch tv blankly. I started to be rude to my mom and my family members. Whenever they would come in my room I would yell at them to get out (I'm pretty sure they just think I'm a cunt) before all this happend I got into a relationship with someone I didn't want to be with because I was being reckless. the last year I broke up with her (I don't even like woman either but I still dated her) I started to eat way to much and I started to stop talking. I missed a lot of school to the point where my mom was almost brought to court. I don't know if this matters but my style started to change and the music I listened to. I had no energy or motivation. At the time I didn't know I was depressed I just knew I was unhappy. \n\nRight now I have to share a room with my brother since we are staying with someone until we find our own place.
