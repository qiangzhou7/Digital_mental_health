I don't see any point in doing anything. \nI have hobbies; I like video games, I play the piano, I make videos, I do some photography. I have interest in politics. \nI go to a school where I do things I like; photography, video game design (yes, Norway is weird and privileged), video editing etc.\n\nI just lose motivation so quickly. \"Oh, I'll play this game.\" Ten minutes go by. \"Uh, this is boring/unrewarding/I could be doing something better/etc.\" \nOr; \"Oooh, I'll make this video game.\" I work on it for 2 days. \"I could just go back to not doing anything, and not have to do this.\"\nI've been trying different things. I don't know why this happens, really. Do I think long-term before I think short-term?\n\nOne good (recent) example of this is New Year's Eve; everyone is emotional and screaming \"Happy New Year\" like it's some sort of rebirth. No. \nThe number in the calendar is different, and there's gonna be another Christmas in 12 months. That's all there is to it in my opinion.\n\nI don't know, is there some secret to life? Am I just gonna one day wake up, feel completely different, and have endless energy to do everything?\n\n(P.S. I don't know if this qualifies as \"depression\".
