Crying, freaking out, insomnia, and the feeling of staring into a black hole of hopeless nothingness.\n\nWell I did my self-care and took an emergency xanax, I've been drinking chamomile and letting the crying come when it comes. I've talked to family and they know what's going on but like...\n\nWhen I'm not actually crying I don't feel a god damn thing.\nI feel dead and hopeless. Nothing feels good. I look at the future and think, what's the point?\n\nI've been trying to do cheerup things, self-care things, and all they do is make me cry in frustration.\n\nHow can I feel alive again?\n",

I've been dealing with some deep seeded issues involving music, my self image and creative-side. The last few months of 2016, I've nearly stopped most recording and writing cause the anxiety of trying to present it online or in person overwhelms me. \n\nLooking towards the new year, I've decided to do things I wouldn't normally do, an open mic last night with a friend and I felt so out of place. And tonight I tried to record a vocal at home and just couldn't get my head into it. I almost sent my microphone through my computer screen. And the kicker, I had a conversation with an industry friend and he is like 'follow your passion', keep writing and recording and I keep texting. \n\nI doesn't make me feel good, why should I follow it if it makes me crazy. I have a great job and it's given me time to think on life and money and where I wanna end up and I feel that at 26 I've been force-fed this crap about following your passion and it will lead to happiness when all it's led to social anxiety, perfectionism, lack of trust, depression and envy. Why can't everyone just let everyone figure out everything in their own time, why is it the modern way to make everyone rush and feel guilty that we have nothing or not doing enough.\n\nI'm mentally exhausted from trying to figure out the whole thing and I don't think it's worth it anymore. The best part is that I keep asking for help and nobody seems to have any ideas or wants to help. Maybe I'm naive about that. Too many bad things about it all.",

I'm on three fucking anti-depressant (citalopram 40mg, wellbutrin 150mg and elavil 30mg) and can't even function normally. \n\nI've been procrastinating most of my christmas break and don't see how I'll be able to go back to work in this shape. \n\nI have absolutely no motivation, I sleep or nap or am zoning out all the time. I'm having bad thoughts sometimes and I'm scared of my own brain. I think I should see my dr. about that.\n\nI'm at a new low point in my life and can't see shit turning around anytime soon.\n\nI feel like staying in bed and just giving up on being happy.

First of all, I hated both schools generally. I had always wanted to go off to college but couldn't afford it. Anyway, I have taken only a couple classes each semester because my depression started almost immediately when I first began school. Now it's two years later, I have nothing but general courses, I thought I'd try computer science and hated it...So I'm back where I started. And everyone I went to high school with are graduating now which makes me feel so much worse. I still don't even know what I want to major in. And I really don't want to stay here for two or three more years to finish a degree. Can anyone relate?",
