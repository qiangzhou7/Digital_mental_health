I dwell on the negative all the time and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get over the break up I had with a girl that was my best friend for 5 years. I would never want to with her again but I just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but feel remorseful for what I said to her when I broke up with her. It still haunts me everyday. She basically wrecked my life and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been trying to rebuild it ever since. \nI have everything that you would think would make someone happy. I have a job that pays nearly 6 figures, my own apartment, my own dog, friends I see almost every day, I try to go to the gym 5 times a week but I simply feel empty inside. So far for the past 2 months all I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done is work, go to the gym, and then study for the LSAT. I have no idea what makes me happy anymore and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to relax because it makes me god awfully guilty. I can barely eat and sleep. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been a mess for a few months and I just needed to vent a little. ",

        "Origin_reddit": "This is quite a lot, but I really hope at least one person will read through. This means the world to me.\n\nHe's a great person. He constantly puts others over himself and he treats me amazingly. This is the man I can see a future with, and he does too. But his depression and anxiety causes him to act in ways he didn't intend, and it affects the relationship negatively. For example, sometimes he doesn't seem enthusiastic to do many things, he has a negative attitude on just about everything, and loses motivation to do anything except stay home. He constantly has anxiety attacks, and often misses classes because it is so bad and he can't get out of bed. It's been like this since the beginning, and I've tried everything to support him. I stay with him through the attacks, I try to give him motivation to get out of bed, and I constantly shower him with love and appreciation.\n\nIt started to affect me as well. I started having panic attacks and feeling quite depressed all the time. It's caused me to break up with him about 2 months ago, as I decided that maybe this isn't in my best interest since it's been affecting me so negatively. I didn't want to constantly be brought down, and knew that I would have to deal with this for the rest of my life if I wanted to stay with him.\n\nAfter a week of talking it out after the breakup, we decided to just take a 2 month break and work on ourselves and problems in our relationship. I had self image problems, wasn't very patient, and could be quite stubborn sometimes, and it certainly affected how I treated him and the problems in our relationship. Taking care of him also made me forget about self-care. I'm better than ever, have improved on myself, made friends and stopped being so reliant on him, and I feel ready to go back in with a more positive outlook on myself and the relationship. However, it is still very hard for him, and although I feel like I've improved and changed tremendously over the course of 2 months, he's still struggling to be more positive and achieve his goals (eat healthier, lose weight, etc). I don't want to be the only person who has reached a great place, only to find that he's still stuck in such a negative place.\n\nHe was on antidepressants, but they made it so much worse and made him suicidal. I've tried to get him to go to therapy, he says he hates therapists and that they don't help/make it worse. He's had bad experiences and I've tried to ask him if we could go together, if we could at least try once, but he won't budge. I've gifted him a self-help book about depression, I've tried to give him little advices about things he could do that have helped other people, but he gets very upset and tells me \"it doesn't work like that\" and doesn't want me to help. I've tried to do the things he wants to accomplish with him, such as asking him if we wants to go for a walk with me, or I'll ask if he wants to go workout with me. The only thing I can do now is let him handle it on his own (as that's what he's asked me to do), and although he at least now has hope for himself, he doesn't seem to want to do much or believe many things will help. He hates when I bring things up like \"science has shown that...\" and gets upset. How do I get him to at least try things?\n\nI know that hidden underneath the mental health problems is an energetic and amazing person, as it shows through all the time. He's told me that when he was younger, he used to be extremely hyper and the complete opposite, but as he got older and his mental illness got worse, he started becoming more mellow and less enthusiastic about things.\n\nThere has to be something I'm missing to be able to communicate with him more effectively. I know that you can't love someone's depression away. I'm not asking how I can get rid of it, I just want advice on how I can help him take steps to help it at least. There's countless people who have found a way to cope with their depression, and I want him to be able to too. I know it won't happen right away, but I think with small steps it could be manageable.\n\nThank you so much.\n\ntl;dr: My boyfriend's depression is ruining our relationship and causing many problems. I've been on a journey of self-improvement myself, and have learned a lot that I believe can help him. What can I do to help, and how can I get him to actually try to better himself when he doesn't want to do anything to help himself?",

Well, there was car issues, pipes froze in my house (because I was dumb), more stuff went and then yesterday I lost a friend because saying that I was lonely  and I mentioned she hasn't visited my new place yet = \"I want to fuck you big time\". We were in the same depression mental health group for 5 weeks together, so she should have understood what I was meant rather than this girl logic and then blocking me without appeal.\n\nAnyways! That isn't the end of it. This one is a totally isolated case from the last but I lost ANOTHER friend. Back to back days. The house is falling down and it decides to drop the toilet on my head for good measure when it's crumbling around me (and it's filled with crap). Anyways! I'll give the quick version. We met on Tinder. Talked for 2 months, had sex a few times a month ago. She was busy with work for the last couple of weeks coming up on Xmas. I wished her a merry Christmas and she replied on the 25th. We talked about meeting up when she was back in town and she said she would let me know with a smiley emoticon.. Normal fare right? Not with passive aggression in play... We didn't chat these entire 5 days until she messaged me in the morning today... I was completely blown away by how fucking dumb this was. I'll just copy paste it...\n\n\"Hey XXXXXX, I've had some time to think and, I'll be honest, I don't think I want to see you again. The first time we met I told you that I'm an egalitarian, and so far you have somehow managed to be racist, sexist, homophobic, and xenophobic and I just can't see past that. Whatever this was was fun for a bit, but it was ruined for me by all the hateful shit you say. Maybe take some time and figure out why you see the world the way you do.\"\n\nOut of ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE. I looked back over my entire SMS history to find absolutely anything off key and I couldn't find a single thing. It gets even more stupid and this is how I knew I was dealing with a completely fucked person and it wasn't anything I did.\n\nI replied to her \"I hope one day you develop a mental disease so I can come chop you down at your knees\" (referring to her cutting me apart over my severe depression altering how positively I see the world and hoping that what goes around comes aroubd) and this fucking nut responds to me \"a normal person wouldn't blah blah blah, you *albeist* fuck\". She COMPLETELY loses the plot and insinuates that I hate disabled people because I hoped that she got her just desserts with someone shitting on her when she's vulnerable like I am... Like.. I can't make this stuff up guys.. \n\nThat's where the ball stops with me and I just let her have it. So much BS packed into this and continually tell her \"what is your deal, I don't get it\" and \"you know you're busting down a sweet guy for no reason right?\"\n\nThis is an open and shut case. We have here a nut case. Rhyme time. She's one of those people that takes everything way too seriously and makes life a real misery for people that don't conform to her exact wording/lifestyle.\n\nTHIS was the most fucked up thing though.... We talked for 2 entire months and there was absolutely no scent of crazy fucker to be smelt. She snuck right up on me and suckerpunched me with this nonsense. This is a lesson that everyone should learn. People are really fucking awesome at faking being a nice person that's there for you and if you so happen to have higher stakes such as a child or a joint bank account with one of these sleeper cells, that is some really scary shit and it could hurt a lot of us..\n\nAnyways, I'm just kind of numb to all of this bad news lately.. It hasn't really hurt me like a break up with a loved one would. But it makes me look inward and wonder if I'm a bad person? We only ever shared happy times and laughs and I tried to convey that I'm a sweet person (her car was vandalized and I was offering to come down and assist her and I only knew her for 2 weeks. Stuff like that) but then this almost conspiracy like fog comes back around me and fucks yet another relationship up. What does everyone think of this one?\n\n(I have to add that this is a person whom conversed with me for many months and did me several times. She had no problem fucking a bigot because I'm not one and I don't think if anyone who had that big of a problem with those types of people, would have sex with someone like that.

I also do a rather specific thing so my skill set is not easily translatable to other jobs - IOW I can't even make a lateral move. At this point, I can't go up, I cant go sideways, and the only way to go is down (which is possible because sometimes budget cuts have cut positions like mine - though uncommon, still a real possibility). Otherwise I could retire out of the position, but by then, the amount of retirement won't really be significant nor enough to live off.\n\nI feel trapped.\n\nThis is going to sound horrible, but my spouse has become an anchor that's dragging me down. They have health issues, and my job's benefits cover those. But they also have a number of other problems. I don't want to blame my problems on someone else but here's the problem: I've come to the conclusion that people only change if they want to change. My spouse needs to change. But I can't make them do that. I can't ask or suggest it. If I do I'm met with resistance. My only option is to get away from them, or put up with their shit - which I've been doing for 20+ years. But here's the thing - we have children now and one exhibits most of the same behaviors my spouse does - and I've come to realize over the years that my spouse had a parent who also exhibited the same issues. Now though, our child is amplifying these issues - to the point where I see it as my spouse's fault that my child is this way. My spouse hasn't been diagnosed, but I'd say they are a hoarder. So is the child. My spouse refuses to listen to reason, or advice, or will not take any suggestions or recommendations - essentially is stubborn. So is the child. I could go on and on but the basic deal is that I could put up with it to some degree with the spouse, but now that the child is doing it too, it's too much to bear.\n\nIt may be my fault for being an \"enabler\" and letting them walk all over me - maybe I'm too weak, I don't know, but I don't feel it's right to force someone else to do something. But I also have given up on trying to convince them of the right thing to do.\n\nIt doesn't help that my spouse has become less and less interested in physical love over the years.\n\nI think you have to have grounds for a divorce. I don't want to get a divorce - I don't want to be that person - I want it to work out - and it makes me feel like I'm giving up, and running away, which is not what I'm supposed to do. But again, I'm not strong enough to face this issue.\n\nMy spouse's issues have also put us in a financial mess. We're barely making it. So I couldn't' get a divorce if I wanted one, because I can't afford a lawyer.\n\nAnd it seems like EVERYTHING is like that - I can't make more money without spending money I don't have to get a higher degree - which doesn't even guarantee a job. I can't get a divorce without spending money I don't have to do so. I can't afford a therapist because it's going to cost me money.\n\nIOW, everything is a significant investment with no promise of any return on that investment - I'll only wind up deeper in the hole.\n\nI'm not suicidal, and I don't want to make light of depression, but I am at the point where really, there's nothing to look forward to anymore. Sure, seeing the kids graduate, having grandkids would be cool, and so on. But it's like, the only way I'll ever get the house clean is if my spouse passes away and I can finally get rid of all of their trash. But what little income they do make will be gone (no life insurance) so the house we've fought so hard to keep will also be gone (becuase we had to refinance and now we'll be paying until we're 90, or dead). If I go, well, I guess it won't be my problem anymore.\n\nSo I'm trapped again.\n\nGetting out of the marriage - well, even if I could, there'd be child support that I couldn't afford.\n\nSo it's either stay here and put up with and accept the blistering mediocrity that is my life, while things just continue to deteriorate and deteriorate, or just go away. Which is not really something I'm considering, so really, I'm trapped in a life of mediocrity in a downward spiral. My spouse won't change. My child will probably become even worse with age. I'm just going to get more and more distant.\n\nI've considered having an affair - but you know what - I'm not the type of person others are attracted to - I don't have any money so the shallow people aren't attracted to me, and I'd have to pay for a service like an affair site - which I know most aren't really legit and even the somewhat legit ones aren't going to have people who are attracted to me becuase I'm the person they married, not the person they want to have a fling with. Plus, it costs money I don't have.\n\nBut you know, I'm not really interested in having an affair. At best it would just be something different to do. And I don't want to treat someone else like that. And I don't want to do that to my spouse. The only thing would be, it would at least be grounds for a divorce.\n\nI mean, it's almost - almost mind you - and this would make a good movie plot maybe - it's almost like my spouse has engineered this entire scenario of getting me into a job and family situation where they keep me poor enough to not be able to get out, but just stable enough where they can lay in bed all day and read books, while not helping around the house or with the kids in any meaningful way, on the premise that while they might not be contributing to the finances this month, or for 6 months, in one month they may make a significant enough amount of money to bring us up to just barely behind and keep me trapped in this position.\n\nKind of like how America treats the majority of its citizens, but I digress. But yeah, the current national climate doesn't help with hope really.\n\nMy job does offer 4 free sessions with a therapist. But I see that turning into a money making scam for them ultimately - get you hooked and then...\n\nAnd I can hear the advice now - that's not going to help.\n\nBasically, my spouse needs to change and if they don't I need to get out. I know they're not going to change. I don't think it's right to give someone ultimatums - I think they need to come to the decision on their own. But it's pretty clear that's not going to happen. And at this point, I've done enough by myself without any support from my spouse I'm don't have the energy or strength to try to help them change, becuase they're not going to accept that there's even anything wrong with what they're doing. I believe it would take me leaving and being gone for them to finally realize it (which, because they have issues with depression, might set me up for guilt for the rest of my life...).\n\nI'm trapped.",

I'm open with my brothers and my parents and socially it's a great environment But now that I'm back in my student house I remember how I felt before.

The rest of my life is going well, I have a nice job, family is great and I'm starting to lose weight.

I could feel something special. We had a connection, a way of talking about anything that felt so genuine. So unique. Needless to say I loved K., more than I ever thought possible it was to love someone at all. I would to anything for her. I wanted to do **everything** for her.

I had started in 2013, and told myself that I would bust my butt off and turn my life around. I wanted to make a change, and get out of the depressing rut I was in (as many of us here can probably relate). I remember coming across so many articles about depression, and basically came to the conclusion that the only way out was to fill my life with \"positive things\" and have some aspiration. And for 3 years straight, that's exactly what I did. I know this might not sound like a very big deal, since its just community college, but I did manage to Ace every class, always studying like their was no tomorrow, and remaining completely goal orientated. The dean herself actually sent me a letter congratulating me as being among the the top 3% in the entire school (its a fairly big campus). Even one of my professors suggested that I become a math tutor, and one year later that's exactly what I did. Not only did I now have a job and was doing well in school, but I was also well on my way to a top research university in my field of study. In my school, math tutors were assigned to the math lab, walk-in basis for free tutoring. One day a girl walked in and asked for some help with her homework. Naturally, I became completely head over heels for this girl. I don't want to bore you with the over-sentimental details, but I think I may be deeply in love with her. I can never stop thinking about her. It's gotten to the point where I honestly wish I had never transferred at all, just so I could talk with her over homework or something, anything. I miss her so much.\n\nWherever you are Gabby, I hope you're doing well and figure out what you want to do in life and become the best at it. I wish I could have brought you a bouquet of roses and tell you Happy Valentines. I love you so much and miss you everyday. I'll always love you.        ",

        "Origin_reddit": "Hi everyone, first things first I hope everyone have a fantastic 2018 around your friends and family\n\nMoving to my story. So, I met this friend through Youtube in 2012 since he was a portuguese gaming youtuber for adults (due to his language and way of talk) which I enjoyed a lot. \n\nI got the chance to start talking with him late 2015 and alongside a couple more viewers, old friends of him and his girlfriend, we were a group of 7 to 8 elements that throughout 2016 we usually hangout a lot on teamspeak (group voice chat) playing games and talking about life and stuff... \n\nIt got very intimate my conversasions with him, told almost my whole life to him, about my sad past and he told me all his lifestrories too. Through 2016 it was all amazing... \n\nBut mid 2017 our group started breaking apart, 2 of us stepped away (which i joined them later) 1 disappeared due to UNI stuff which I respect,  his girlfriend was left almost alone (which I will explain next), and him which joined a new group of paying-friends (which I will explain too) \n\nSo, apparantly he was doing youtube only as a Hobbie and every cent he took from there in publicity was just a \"way to thank him\" for the amazing job he did. He had about 10k views per day on his videos but due to youtube polices he wasn't earning enough to make a living of that, but it was helping playing his bills. \n\nSo he decided to move to twitch,  which is a live streaming platform focused for gamers. He was quite a success there and started making quite some cash on donations and monthly supporting subscriptions...\n\nLater he started leaving our group and started talking more with the ones who were giving him the money (top donators)  instead of his friends who were never with him for the money...\n\nHe left us, we asked him why,  and his awenser was that US refused to join him, which was half true, because I personally didn't wanted to join and secondly he was the one leaving. \n\nI started noticing that his girlfriend was getting sad,  by posting sad songs over and over on her facebook, and I started asking if was something wrong, and she trusted me that the relationship wasn't going well (after 3 years together), he was spenting less and less time with here, starting with excuses to not visit her personally and stuff like that. \n\nDuring that time in october I got a bombshell, his girlfriend told me that he told her that met one of his female subscribers on twitch personaly and \"just\" kissed her,  cheating on my friend/his girlfriend...\n\nI don't know why she forgived him, even after that he didn't changed his attitude,  he continues flirting every girl that pops on his stream...\n\nI was the one supporting her through this rough time, trying to cheer her up in every chance I got, playing with her,  watching some videos and stuff... She was thankful to me, and I was like \"thats what real friends do right?\". \n\nBut between me and him,  he just started to ignore me more and more,  he had time to play with his paying friends but to awenser a simple \"hello\"  from me took weeks.\n\nLike,  i'm not obcessed with him,  i'm just truely disaponted with him and his atittude... Swapping friends for money,  and leave his girlfriend suffering all the time... \n\nI exploded... I couldn't hold this anymore,  so,  I decided to let know every single paying supporter of his stream know,  to what type of person they are giving the money to...\n\nHow? Just with simple \"memes\" (images with text) comparing him to Dr. Disrespect (One of the biggest twitch streamers who admited publicly he cheated om his wife,  and had the balls to stoo streaming to solve his issues). I criticized my friend for only caring about the money and putting that over his girlfriend that loves him more then everything even after he cheated on her... \n\nWhat happened next was: He blocked me everywhere instead of asking me why I did such thing,  since he didn't did that,  I asume that I asume that I wasn't a friend for him anymore, and decided to run away and delete me from everywhere. \n\nThe thing is now everyone knows what type of person he his, and let them know if someone with even more money comes,  they can be left behind. But since now my ex friend doesn't want to lose his funding (since he now lives from donations makong it a full time job). I don't want the other to happen what happened to me... \n\nAm I regreted of what I done? Nope! The only \"if\"  point here was how his girlfriend reacted after I did this... I clearly see that she was sad,  and things could have been solved other way without exposing his life,  which I disagree, I exposed one thing about his life,  so the way she meant was the life as a whole,  which I didn't exposed\n\nShe is the only reason that this is upsetting me... I have 0 regrets on him,  but on her... I never wanted her to be sad at me because of this...  Never was my intention... \n\nThis is my first post here... Just wanted to share my story,  if theres something you guys missunderstood due to my average english,  please comment below,  I really wanted to get this out of me...  If readed till the end... Thanks :) \n",
