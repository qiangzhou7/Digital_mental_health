I have dangerous thoughts, I'm crawling back inside my own head, and I left the apartment only once this entire weekend: to do my laundry so no one will notice anything is amiss tomorrow. \n\nSince I've been on it, I could count the number of days I've missed taking a pill on one hand. Then, over about the last month and a half, I noticed a decline.\n\nI doubt it's a matter of increasing the dosage of my medication either. I'm on Effexor 300mg, have been for a couple months now. My provider told me that I'm already at the upper limit for medicinal dosage, so it seems that simply going up won't be an option. Which kinda sucks, as I'm not dealing with a whole lot of side effects, except for maybe memory problems, which is probably unrelated as it's historically been terrible anyway.\n\nI think it's just simply a matter of it not working as well anymore. At the peak, I could go hours, sometimes a day or two, without a thought about killing myself. Before, I couldn't go an hour without considering it for at least a couple minutes. Now they're back, along with the feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing.\n\nI don't want to go back to that, I don't want to. I want to get better. I just want to know if it's possible for medication to just... stop working like this. To work one week, and then start dropping down again. It sucks. It really fucking sucks and I just want to stop wanting to jam a fucking knife in my neck. \n\nSo, yeah. Is that possible? For medication you've been on for less than 6 months to just stop?",

I thought to myself what the fuck can be open at 8:30pm that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when I passed by Angel City Brewery. It was fucken open. I went inside, it was almost completely empty. I got me an IPA and started walking around, I ended up going to the balcony they have. I sat down on some of the couches they have. I started browsing Reddit like usual, reading every depression post. I was half way done with my beer when some one speaks to me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs some one sitting here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked myself is someone speaking to me!?

I remember stuttering \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She repeats \u00e2\u0080\u009cis someone sitting here\u00e2\u0080\u009d I say \u00e2\u0080\u009coh no\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked if she can join me and I say yes.

Then she asked me if I was waiting on someone. I said no, I usually go out alone. I kept looking at her, I asked her what was her name. She told me Maria, I introduce myself. She asked why was I here by myself. I told her I just needed to get out. \nShe told me she wanted a drink and asked me if I can go with her to get her drink. I said of course. I started getting even more nervous, asking myself why is this person talking to me. We got to the bar and she ordered a drink, I ordered one for myself since I had finished mine.

We ended up grabbing Jenga. We went back to the sofa I was sitting at. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never played jenga before so it was my first time. Boy did I fucken suck.  We talked for a while, and told me she moved back to LA from Mexico and to pardon her bad English. I told her what you talking about you speak perfect English. As I got to know her, my depression starting go away, I felt happy, I was smiling. \nIt was about to be 10pm when she told me she was feeling tired already since she had a long day. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want here to leave, I was enjoying this so much. I told her that it was fine and that I was thankful for sitting with me.

Then she said \u00e2\u0080\u009c you know what let me have yours\u00e2\u0080\u009d I gave her my number. She told me it was nice meeting me. And told me I should go home soon because it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be okay to keep drinking. We shook hands and she started walking away.

People who claim to be depressed trivialise the condition for those whose lives are genuinely blighted by it.\n\nThere are unwritten rules for answering certain questions. When people ask: \u00e2\u0080\u009chow are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d they expect to get the statutory \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m fine thanks, how are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Not: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m falling apart and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cope,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get through the day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or some other variation of the hellish truth. That makes for a rubbish situation where, even when you get texts or actual face-to-face enquiries into your wellbeing, you skirt around it or make something up or dismiss it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have they got to be depressed about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve dedicated the other half of this post to tackling some of the things I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard people say relating to depression. This one usually rears its head when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a celebrity involved. Take Robin Williams for example. Known for his seemingly happy-go-lucky nature and vivacious sense of humour. Clearly his smile was hiding a world of pain. But he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rich, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s famous, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s successful. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s he got to be depressed about? We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never know the answer to that, but we need to stop asking the question. Or rather, we need to stop asking it in such a dismissive way. When the news broke about Aaron Lennon, it was immediately followed by references to his income and status as a Premier League footballer. Yes, there are people who have it worse economically and people who have had horrible, harrowing things happen to them throughout their lives and just \u00e2\u0080\u009cgot on with it\u00e2\u0080\u009d but why use that as a stick to beat someone who is already at rock bottom? They will be well aware of all that. Everything you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying and thinking, they will have said to themselves ten times over. So then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the feeling of guilt thrown into the mix; the sense that they have no right to feel the way they do. That just compounds the issue.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so sensitive\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDepression\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not about sensitivity. Some of the strongest, toughest, take-no-prisoners- type of people suffer with depression. I know because I know them. There needs to be more openness and understanding surrounding mental health and well-being. But we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all need to be holding hands and showering each other with compliments and treading on eggshells, scared to say or do anything that may be misconstrued in some way. Far from it. When someone is in the pits of despair, the best thing you can do is just be there for them. In the most normal way possible. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do anything spectacular or extraordinary. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to change your behaviour or your personality or the way you interact with them. You haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got a magic wand. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fix their problems. But just being there can make all the difference. Sometimes, when wandering the corridors at work, perpetual cloud hanging ominously overhead, the sight of a friendly face coming towards me was enough to make me a bit better. If honest surveys were taken in the workplace, there would probably be a surprising number of people who are experiencing depression or anxiety, or have experienced it at some point in their lives. Everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fighting their own battles. It would be so much easier if people could join forces.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention seeking\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis one is dangerous, because if someone at rock bottom hears this about themselves, after they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve plucked up the courage to disclose what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going through, it can send them spiralling into further isolation and their thought patterns spiralling down life-threatening avenues. When I hear the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cattention-seeking\u00e2\u0080\u009d used in relation to depression, it makes me laugh and makes me angry in equal parts. Do people really think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve devised this little world of hell for myself and decided to live in it just for the fun of it? That I choose to be a misery who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the point in anything anymore? That I consciously throw away people and things and opportunities that mean a great deal to me because I just love to make life hard for myself? The isolation, the hopelessness, the despair, the panic, the dread, the turmoil, the cacophony of emotions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all of them negative \u00e2\u0080\u0093 crushing my spirit day in day out. Love all that, me.\n\nIf you found this useful you can check out my other contents here :-   http://www.health.online/explore/",

Being there for someone who is struggling and offering support without judgment can make all the difference. It's not about attention-seeking, but about feeling lost and alone in a world that doesn't always understand or empathize with mental health issues.\""

Spent the last two years on 50mg, and the last 6 months cutting it in half, then quarters, then 8ths. (I know you're not meant to cut them, but all docs seemed to have no idea what to do.)\n\nI really haven't felt sad or hopeless since I was about 20ish, so have just been taking them as I could never get help or instructions for tapering off from docs. \n\nThese last 2 weeks, I've stopped taking the 8th of a tablet and oh my God. \nI don't know who I am. The side effects are terrible. I am jumbling my words, mental blanking so hard that some days I can't remember how to get home, or find my car in the car park. Extremely angry and irritable, crying over everything, literally a cute freaking dog on TV. I forget basic words, today I referred to the pantry as the bathroom, just weird shit. My short term memory.. Is non existant. I just had to ask my partner to repeat what I just said to him cause I couldn't remember.  I start making up words and somehow convince myself they're a word!? (Refrigenative???)wtf. Yet I'm a lit nerd. I'm an executive too.. In the advertising industry. Words and well written sentences and quick wit are what my career revolves around. I am fucked. Would love to know if anyone else has been in this situation.. I don't know what to do. :(\n \nThis whole experience just makes me want to jump in front of a truck.

        "Origin_reddit": "Imagine a wide, empty expanse. There is nothing but the brown crust of the earth and distant mountains, hinting that something lies beyond this place. Alone, you drive across the surface, the realization of how screwed you are slowly rising in the pit of your stomach. \n\nYou're so far from your destination that you're not sure where it is or where you are. And the surface below you is not hard; it looks solid but the weight of the car presses into what is deep mud.  It becomes more difficult to continue forward, so you shift up and press the gas to try to keep moving; if you lose the momentum, you will  get stuck. If you get stuck, you know that this is where you'll die. The car struggles and the wheels begin to spin loose, and you sink further and further into the mud. \n\nMired in the bog, climbing out you see there is no freeing the car. The sun above is oppressive and harsh, the day humid and long. Echoes of voices from family or friends ring through the mind as you broil in the heat; what is real, and what is imagined? You doubt yourself and everything in the delirium of heat stroke, but you press forward, maybe out of guilt or instinct or spite. \n\nBut as you chase the sun, it sinks below the horizon. The night is cold, and the frost twists down your spine and into your essence. You have nothing left to propel you forward, and fall, confused in the dark, exhausted beyond despair, dying in a quiet agony, alone. That's when you realize that you can't even cry anymore, as the tears freeze your exhausted eyes closed. \n\n---\n\nI feel that I've come to the point of there being no win for me anymore. I can envision steps needed to meet smaller goals, but I fail each and every time I try and take these small steps. I can't progress in my career and I can't really even afford to live anymore.   Because of that I can't take care of myself properly and I can't imagine getting out of the bog; I am mired here, with no way out and I'm not even sure which way I would go. But what I know for sure: I hate what I see in the mirror every single time I glance at it. \n\nI've lost most of the people in my life. At this point I think that what shadow of existence I cling to will be completely alone and absolutely cannot see growing into a normal adult relationship like every other, well adjusted 29 year old. I feel that, even if I were to reach my destination, I will continue to be alone as there is no future or meaning to life for a person like me. \n\nIt is so soul-wrenchingly exhausting to paint on a brace face every day and to try, just to be met with more failure and to have the best possible outcome also be one of failure by any societal measure. I had deluded myself into believing that the losing hand I was dealt wasn't going to be where my story ended. Well, I don't set the rules of the game. \n\nI want to sleep but I can't; not now. I wish I was never born, but there is part of me that wants to live, if only out of spite at this point. I don't want to be bitter or mean, and the only win that feels possible when you've already lost the game is to try and stop caring about the rules and play on ones own terms. It won't stop me longing for the night,  so the icy hand of death can snuff me out. \n\nTL; DR: my life circumstances dictate that even success is still a failure. ",

The main thing that convinces me that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, is the fact that I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attempted suicide in any form yet.
