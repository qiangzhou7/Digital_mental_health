"Hi,
I started college this year after a gap year and I went to a major that I was really excited about and I was preparing for it. Itâs arabic language and history major. 2 months in I knew somethingâs just not right. One of the teachers is really demotivational and the classes were really hard. But I kept going because it was my dream to go to this school. Now itâs finals month here in Czech and I just donât know what to do. I suck at the language, I tried but I just donât get it so I told my family and friends and everyone just says that I cannot give up! âYou have to go through finals! Give it a try!!! You have to push yourself and do the best!â 
But Iâm pushing myself I guess Iâm just not pushing as hard as everyone else. But I donât want to push too hard. Iâm already really depressed I started going to therapy because of the school, Iâm crying everyday. I donât think I can get through. 
Why is everyone telling me that I cannot give up? Why is âgiving upâ seen as such a bad thing for people? 

My long distance boyfriend is the only one who supports me the way I need. He is motivational and heâs saying that itâs okay to quit. But you know, heâs not here and even though he is my support I need something to tell my family or just people around that they will get and not see as a bad thing to do (giving up). 

I donât even know what I want to hear from you guys, but thank you for reading this. ",2,. One of the teachers is really demotivational and the classes were really hard

"Hey. I've never been diagnosed with anything so I don't know if I'm supposed to post here, but I couldn't really think of any other place. 

What am I supposed to do about my worth? I feel as if everything I try is a failure and I convince myself of that fact. I can't handle any criticism because it consumes my entire mind and destroys any confidence I had to do something. I'm now finding it impossible to do any schoolwork because I've decided that no matter what I do I'm going to fail. 

I have no intimacy in my life and that makes me feel like I'm not good enough around my peers. It kills any confidence I have around people so I just try to avoid any social situations.

I know these thoughts are unhealthy but I can't even force myself to try to get better.

Maybe I'm just too sensitive and a pussy.

"Hi everyone,

First time posting here, so apologies if this is out of place.

I'm currently a 19 year old that's just started at university in Montreal, Canada. I've recently come to accept that I may have been dealing with depression throughout my life. If I think back, there have always been these periods where I've felt like I've been just barely holding on and every experience is muted. Then I come out of it and everything seems fine. Then the cycle repeats.

I've been reluctant to seek help or talk about this due to a number if factors. I'm too proud -- I hate admitting that I'm not managing the little things we have control over in life. In the positive periods, it's so easy to forget the dark ones. They've been just enough to propel me through the standard hallmarks of being ok, and then I think ""surely it can't be *that* bad"". Third, I'm still heavily dependent on my parents financially. That's sort of an endless cycle and I'm not exactly in a position to break it atm.

This past month has been the third time in 6 months that I've hit another low point, and each has been progressively lower. This time, I'm really terrified of the thoughts that keep coming up. Earlier they came up, but I was able to push them aside. Now they come up and I'm seriously (almost calmly) considering them. I've never felt more hopeless in my life. Obviously, this has been affecting me more than usual and I feel like everything is going downhill. Other than my family, I'm really reluctant to talk about it with my friends because I'm worried about how it would affect them since I know a number of them have mental illness.

I finally tried talking about how I've been feeling with my parents in these last weeks. That culminated in them finally accusing me of being a self-centered liar who was just saying things to get attention, blaming me for ""accepting negative thoughts from other people"", asking me if I'm possessed by some evil, and threatening to beat me and pull me out of university. So obviously getting their help to deal with this is not an option (which shouldn't surprise me tbh). 

I feel like I'm on the brink of really messing up, and I know it's my responsibility to seek help for this. Even if there's no way to beat it, I want strategies to make sure it never hits me this hard again. 

**Does anyone here have any tips on where to find free or low cost mental health support from professionals, general or specific to my situation? Any words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated** :)",2,still heavily dependent on my parents financially

"I did well in high school, but ever since I got to college, my grades and my mental health have taken a dip. I'm sure this forum gets posts like these all the time, but how do you give yourself motivation to do well? I live alone, estranged from family, and I'll scrape along, making sure to stay alive, but I never really live. I'll make friends, but since I can't visit home, I'm usually stuck during summer and winter breaks alone. I have a job, but it's tied to the online school, so I don't really see anyone. I'm not suicidal, but I don't understand how people can just wake up with the motivation to run for class president or actually make a change in their lives. I still wake up in the morning, but should I? I can't do anything. Nothing changes. In fact, nothing interesting has happened in my life for a while, and I'm sure that's my own fault, but coming from a city and going to a college in the middle of nowhere, I have no Idea what to do.

"I'm sorry if this post ends up being long, I'll try to keep it short but please read to the end if you can. Basic background information: 20 almost 21-year-old male, I'm currently studying computer science (in my 3rd year in college). I actually took the 2017 fall semester off because of how uncertain I felt about actually studying computer science and I just felt terrible in general due to anxiety/depression. During my time off I worked to save up some money and sought help for my issues. Been going to therapy and got meds for anxiety but nothing for depression. Everything was going relatively well/getting better until I had to go back to school. My thoughts of self-doubt began to creep back in and everything just feels joyless. This always seems to happen when I feel stressed about change or literally anything else. I've lost a lot of interest in things I usually enjoy and just feel down. I feel like a failure because I'm thinking about changing my major with a year left. It'll most certainly add an extra year to my college career (I understand that this is actually somewhat common but it still makes me feel bad). To make it even worse, while I'm feeling uncertain of what to study, I genuinely have no idea what I'd study instead cause I'm so damn indecisive. I don't know where else to turn. Computer science seems cool to me but the work seems so joyless because most positions are desk jobs from what I can tell which makes me feel depressed knowing that's what's waiting for me when I graduate. I've spoken to guidance counselors, visited a few places to do job shadows, and done countless hours of career research and I'm just feeling so done with all of it. Can anyone offer any suggestions to me or has anyone ever been in a similar situation? I can give you more information if you choose to reply and need more insight.

"I had to let go of my dream career, what I was passionate about doing for the rest of my life. You see, for years I was chasing this dream and it finally came knocking at my door. I wanted to be a police officer. I talked to everyone about it. Went on ride a longs. You. and it. I really believed in helping and protecting people. That was my calling. Due to what life throws at you, I was able to start applying in my late 20âs. And today, at the age of 32, I said no. See, in the 4-5 years it took me to get accepted somewhere, one has to keep going with life. And I did. I got married, got a decent job with decent pay, was able to buy a tiny home. Just life. I have been lucky and I am thankful. 

However, I am slowly dying inside. I canât stop running to the bathroom to cry for the last 2 weeks. I am close considering going to the hospital to get stress leave for work. 

So why did I do it? Well in short: a bunch of excuses. Didnât feel physically ready for the daily challenges which I was told could lead to my dismissal from the academy; during the time I did exercise and prepared myself I injured myself a lot (knee, back, shoulder), which at the academy could lead to a possible dismissal; also, the academy is a âlive-inâ academy, meaning that Monday-Friday I would live at the academy, something my wife was having a lot of emotional problems dealing with that thought; lastly, I would be lying if I said that the whole live-in academy situation did not worry me - it was, and a lot. There has always been something âwrongâ with me when it comes to attachment. I am that guy that cannot say good-bye. And the thought of being away from my wife 5 days a week and dealing with the stresses of an academy really worried me to the point that I knew I would want to come home. So I made the âadultâ decision that it would be stupid to go knowing I would not make it and risk my financial stability. 

So now Iâm sitting here. In tears writing this. The last two weeks have literally been like death. I have nothing to look forward to. I have nothing that interests me. I am not applying to any other departments because of my age. My body was holding on to this academy and I donât have it in me anymore. I really have no purpose. I hate everything about my job - it eats my soul bit by bit. I donât have suicidal thoughts. But I do feel like Iâm sitting here for another 40 years waiting for my turn to go. Oh and of course, I donât have anyone else to talk to but to my wife and I have worn her down a lot. She has been so great. ",2,Well in short: a bunch of excuses

"Hello, my name is Pranav. I am an 18 year old guy, living in India, currently in the last year of school with about 50 days to go before my final examinations. A lot depends upon my performance in these exams - most importantly, my dream of studying in Canada, and the image and respect that I've built for myself all these previous years.

**I am not at all prepared for the exams!** For 2 years now I've been struggling with inner demons (procrastination, severe escapism, depression). I went to a shrink, I took pills (stopped 4 months ago), I even saw a pseudo-psychologist with radical methods which were helpful (short-term) but very oppressive. No longer doing that either.

I have a great life, loving parents and brother, and all the comforts, leisures and resources one might need. I have potential and ambition, **but no drive**. Sometimes I feel as if I am just lazy, worthless or stupid in some way. I am certainly pitying myself, which is the worst. No surprise that I've often contemplated suicide but never did it.

I never stopped researching my own condition and I believe that I have finally come across **one helpful treatment**. It's called Metacognitive Therapy (MCT). But as it turns out, I suck so much that I didn't stick with it either!

**NOW,** here I am. A well-endowed and capable human being, with tools and knowledge. I know what to do. What action to take. But I feel shitty all the time and keep wandering off to wasting time. I got rid of my computer but I cannot do away with video games.

I feel shitty, stupid, guilty, insecure, helpless and like a failure. I am on a self-made ride for self-destruction. I have the tools and **ONE LAST SHOT AT SALVATION**.

""The whole bid for submission by current managerial values is based on almost one mistake: the confusion between working and fulfilling one's potential""


Have it something right ? I'm speaking of course about the social way we are seeing work. In the way work as it is socially understood, is really one dimensionnal, like if somewhat every competency that humanity was able was separated in each individual, impacting view of life of each. We are always referencing to the quote ""work is tripalium"" and stuff in social term.
Imo it's at least currently (while not in IA society :) ) a false idea to modify work, because while there is a hierarchy/domination, even from outside workforce (government manage work activities while work hierarchie = smooth/flat), there will be always some form of resistance finishing with creating new morality, new idea, and cutting off what work are mean to do : producing for surviving as a species.


Accomplishing your potential mean you use actually fun, you use imagination, you use discipline, you use your emotions, you use self control, you use your ability to introspect, you use your memory, perhaps ultimately a excellent work would be one that reflect the most the life wich all are actually living, meaning you have to use your memory in a global way, not being limited by artificial rule we are creating. A real work have part of actually not working, and not being managed for not working as it happen in homosexual company in silicon valley.

Isn't it a problem for those who are seeking actual accomplishment  ? I don't mean forcibly extra uppa uda mega accomplishment, just for the stuff itself. There is ppl wich are actually working better in choosen activities / in hobby mode. Aren't you more concentrated in this place than in work ? I'm not saying that writing in reddit is a higher accomplishment than your work, probably not if you are in IT for example, but writing here require more completeness than doing 1 repetitive task for all the month there another one then another one...

The main problem with trying to submit ppl with moral (like in our typical managemental way of seeing the work world) is that it end with devaluing moral itself more than being in a complying/not complying problem",2,"a false idea to modify work, because while there is a hierarchy/domination, even from outside workforce"

"This is going to be a long one.

Cliffs:
- I thought it was going to be something more 
- I wasnât fullfilled 
- following your dreams doesnât make you happy
- You are sold a lie to get you to consumed 

This is my story of quiting my job to travel the world and follow what I thought my passion was.

So for the past 6 months I have been planning to quit my job so I can start a travel vlog channel on YouTube and work on photography and film making. I bought some gear, I even got free products from companies because they believed in my vision. I honestly thought this was it, like I thought this was going to be my thing. I thought I was on the right path doing this. I thought this would be my dream. I thought travelling the world sharing my pics and videos would make me happy and fullfilled. So after 6 long months, the big day finally arrived. I was so excited guys like I was over the moon about it all. This wasnât really a holiday for me this was my time to focus on my craft and work towards my goals in youtube, photography and film making. But honestly after a few days something started to change fast. I didnât really feel good, I felt like annoyed that I had to edit this vlog or edit this photo. I became very unhappy and unfulfilled extremely fast. The only time I felt good was when I was high on mushrooms and drunk on alcohol (that was for nye only) but I started to ask myself âhey do you even enjoy what you are doingâ and to be honest I didnât. I thought travelling the world sharing my journey with everyone would be fullfilling, I had friends and others tell me they were inspired that I had the courage to do this, I kinda felt like they were looking up to me and that my decision to do this would make them more confident for them to go after there dreams and I know that is a very positive thing but that wasnât motivating for me at all. 

I am a simple man. I donât give a **** about money or fame, pretty much my core value is to live a happy and fulliled life and to be surround by good people. The 9-5 isnât for me. Hats off to you if you are ok with it but for me personally I couldnât think of anything worse then sit in a box under arterfical light for 8+ hours a day t days a week plus the commute. When the realisation that the thing I thought was going to be my thing wasnât was the most crushing feeling I have ever felt. It got to the point where I almost broke down. 

I have had successful online businesses in the past, but even when they were successful I wasnât happy because I quickly realised this is like a 9-5 where I am only doing it for the money, I felt no joy or fullfillment from it so I quit. I currently do crypto investing, doing alright with it. Made 2k today but honestly yet again I felt no joy front that. I think a lot of people see other peopleâs lives on tv or social media and say to themselves âI want that lifeâ I was the same, but I quickly realised I was sold a lie. Some of you might comment saying âyou are just depressed broâ honestly I donât think I am, I believe 99% of depression cases are miss diagnosed. I believe a lot of it has to do with people living unfullfied lives. Yes maybe 1% have a chemical imbalance but I strongly believe majority of people are not happy because they are not living unfullfied lives 

Right now I am thinking of just going home take some time off to revaluate. I must say though this really is painful this feeling. Thinking that something is going to be your passion and honestly believing in the bottom of your heart this is your thing but then realising (especially so fast) thatâ itâs not is depressing. I just wanted to make you aware that the whole âquit your job to travel the world thingâ might sound cool and all but I promise you itâs not going to make you happy. To me the only way to live a happy and fullfilled life is to do things you actually enjoy, to be on a road and to actually have some sort of direction.",2,quiting my job to travel 
"I believe I have struggled  with depression and anxiety for a long time but the past year or so seems to have dramatically increased it. 

So here's the story: 
I had been working a job at a tire shop which I didn't not enjoy with people I didn't get along with. I was seeing a girl who was in an open marriage who eventually became my best friend and biggest supporter.
I was giving the opportunity by a buddy's parents to join the merchant marines and go to the seafearers school in piney point. I was not sure if I would like it but his mom was very persistent that I do it and since joining the military was always a dream of mine but was out of the question due to my past, I agreed.
I have always separation anxiety for some reason, even though I have never felt particularly close to much of anyone or anything. I knew I would miss my family and friends and skydiving (which at one time was the only thing that really made me happy) and booze but I went into the seafearers program with all the promises of a wonderful, rewarding career making more money that I could spend. 
Well, needless to say, the ""school"" was not the prestigious, academy in which I was told. It was more or less a free labor, brain washing institution full of ignorant criminals and, pretty sure, illegal immigrants, ran by a union which I'm pretty sure is a mob front.  None the less, I got through the first phase of the school. The girl I had been seeing at home was very supportive and we texted everyday as we had for the entire year we had known each other. I was working out everyday and was reading a few self help books to try to help cope with being away from everything at home. 
Immediately after the first phase of school, you are sent directly on to a ship which I was assigned with two others from my class, one was a guy I got along with pretty well and the other was the biggest piece of shit I have ever met in my life. There were good and bad days but to be honest I really wasnât into it, working everyday and only making $35/day however, I kept telling myself that it was a good experience and that it would be better next time. We did have shitty internet on the ship so I could communicate with my family, which was rare, but again the girl would text me everyday.
So  that tour was done after 90 days being on the ship in the middle east. Time to go home, finally.
I went home with almost no money, still living with my parents but after over 7 months, was ready to see everyone again and the girl I had left behind and to finally skydive again. This is were things turned for the worse. I soon realized that the  warm welcome home I had hoped for wasnât what I had coming. Most of the time I sat around my house drinking alone frustrated with myself, my finances, the fact that I was 26 with almost no money, no real friends, still living at my parents who are having to pay my bills while Iâm trying to get through the rest of this program, still hoping that it will be worth wild. The girl I had been talking to the past year was always busy and seemed to never have much time to hang out and we began arguing more and more because, being the jealous person I am, wanted to be with her all the time. I kept skydiving on the weekends but eventually, it became frustrating to me as well and lost most of the joy it once brought me. There were many time I would hope for a malfunction that would let me go in or times when I would consider simply not pulling. 
After about a month I went back to the âschoolâ to do the third phase. I got through it and even through all our issues me and the girl who I was now very much in love with, still texted back and forth everyday. Adding  to my self hatred, I was in love with a married woman. Everyday at the school, my class seemed to be in trouble for something. Losing the few privileges that were available to us and getting assigned daily extra detail. After two long months, it was over and time to go home and await shipping assignments. I was pretty sure I wanted nothing to do with this union at this point but didnât want to let my buddyâs parents down, they had put a lot of effort into me doing this and really wanted me to go through with it. So I decided to go home and wait for them to give me my assignment. At this point, it has been almost a year since I have made any real money and having my parents and grandmother paying the few bills I had which made me feel terrible. 
When I got home, the same problems as last time. I felt alone, completely alone. 
There was a part of me that was looking forward to shipping again. As this time I would actually be making a wage. After about a month of waiting, I was assigned a ship which I was hoping to get to see some interesting ports and make some money. Well got on and found out there is no internet and the only way to contact anyone was through a terrible company email program. Found that my wage was basically bullshit with my overtime rate being $12/hour and then I saw the ship schedule, fucking middle east again with only a few ports on the way that we were allowed to get off at for maybe an hour or two. On top of that, the cooks were awful. There was hardly a week that went by were someone wasnât sick from the food. Then, about 2 weeks into the voyage crossing the Atlantic,  my laptop charger was surged and ruined so I couldnât access the four terabytes of movies and books on my hard drive I had downloaded for the trip. I was able to get off in a port in Italy to try to find another charger but ended up having to buy a whole new computer just for the charger I needed.
Somehow while at sea, my debit card had been used in China for almost $800. I was able to have that taken care of but my card was canceled giving me no access to my money until I could get home to activate the new card they had sent me.
Then we got stuck in Beaumont Texas due to hurricane Harvey for weeks. One night, after things were beginning to open back up, me and another guy went out on the town. To get in and out of the port from the ship, you have to be escorted by port police from the ship to the gate and vis versa. Upon returning to the ship, I was sitting in the backseat in the middle with the other guy in the front passenger seat and the port police officer driving. The idiot cop wrecked the police truck directly into a concrete support beam sending my face flying into the steel divider of the police truck busting up my face and sending me to the hospital. After getting stitched up and a few days bac on the ship, I was eventually sent home.
Back home again, I was sent to a doctor and complained about upper back pain that radiated into my neck and shoulder pain. They told me to do physical therapy 3 times a week at their facility for 4 weeks without them taking x-rays or anything. I did that reluctantly, constantly asking to be referred to a specialist to have an mri done on my upper back and shoulder. After the therapy the doctor finally ordered an mri on September 25th. It took me a month of fighting back and forth between the shipping company and the union insurance company to get the mri  and finally got it done October 25th, the day after my birthday. Finally, I thought but come to find out, he ordered an mri on my upper neck. Not my back or my shoulder. At my follow up appointment, when confronted about it, he assured me that it was suppose to be my shoulder and back but after leaving the room for 3 hours, he returned to say that he thought my neck was more of an issue than  my shoulder at the time. My neck only hurt from the pain that was in my back which I made sure to express from day one. I asked if he was going to reorder the mri to actually look at the problem to which he replied no that I would have to deal with the pain for the rest of my life because there was nothing else he could do and he cleared me to go back to work even though I could hardly move my head, sit up straight, or lift my shoulder.
Over the next month I had hurt my knee somehow but hoped it would eventually get better. It would lock up if I bent it and the only way to get it unlocked was to go down to ground on my knees and sit back on my feet. The girl I was in love with at this point and I continued to see each other but seemed like less and less, maybe a few times a month. We went out one day I had decided to cut back on the drinking and got very drunk to the point I had to cut her off and take her back to my house. She wanted to have sex but I told her no because she was so drunk but she kept trying. She started telling me things like âwith you itâs different, I donât feel like  a piece of meat like everyone elseâ I asked her who is everyone else and she told me she gets paid to have sex and she was a prostitute. I didnât believe her but was insistent, trying to find a so called website she was apparently on and showing me text messages from people she said she was only friends with before where she has been sending nude pictures and explicit messages. When she woke the next morning I confronted her about it to which she had no recollection and admitted to seeing and having sex with multiple other men and women but not the whole being a prostitute or getting paid for sex which she still denies to this day. Being the only person I have ever felt like I could talk to, I still talk to her, which makes me hate myself. 
Over the next few weeks I hurt my other knee and had surgery on both meniscus. I was told I would be back walking in a few days with full recovery in a few weeks before I went in for surgery.  I went in for surgery and my mom had taken me and the girl that broke my heart asked to be there, I agreed to it and they both waited during the surgery. I woke up in leg braces being told that it was worse than they thought and that I would be in leg braces for up to 10 weeks. No skydiving, no rock climbing, no running or working out, no walking except to and from the bathroom with crutches. I couldnât believe it.
Today is the end of week 4 of being confined to my bed in my parents house to which I live. Only being able to go out for therapy and almost no one has came to visit me. The girl has a few times but itâs awkward and I keep trying to find a way to forgive her and some way to trust her, why, I guess I feel like sheâs all I have. My mom has been having to do pretty much everything for me which I canât stand. I sit here all day in bed frustrated, bored, depressed, worrying, hating everything that has happened, wondering what could possibly be next until I finally just give up and start downing any alcohol I can get my hands on. Back and shoulder still messed up. Havenât heard anything about being able to see another doctor about that issue. Also, about a week before surgery, my clutch went out in my car. I ordered a new clutch and flywheel and rushed to get it put in before my surgery. I did but after a few hours I noticed something wasnât right. I took the transmission back out and discovered that the paint on the flywheel melted and let the bolts holding it to the crank come loose and one snapped off. So now my car is torn apart in my dads garage possibly needing a new crankshaft.

I am constantly trying to tell myself that there is someone else out there that is way worse off than me which I know is true and that is shouldnât complain and that things will get better but at this point, Iâm no longer so sure.

"I'm approaching 28 and I think I've hit my lowest point of the last five years. I've had my issues for as long as I can remember. Particularly after my dad died in my early teens. Things just never really made a whole lot of sense to me. I don't think I ever really understood the concept of school, y'know? I get that it's supposed to prepare you for life, but it all just seemed like something I had to do so I wouldn't be bothered. Even in my senior year, I never really dreamed about ""being"" anything. 


Jumping ahead to where I am now, I've essentially done warehouse work off and on for the last 6 years. I quit my last job this November, and I'm pretty sure my family and room mate are pissed at me for it. I'm not really the type to talk about my feelings and all of that face-to-face, so I basically told them that I couldn't deal with it anymore. What really happened was that it was night-shift, and it was something that I hated. The one thing I've come to know about myself is that if I'm feeling depressed, lack of sleep will completely mess me up. The night I resigned, I spent the first three hours of my shift trying to keep myself from breaking down and crying in front of a group of strangers. The kicker is that I don't even really have a good reason for it. I think being there and being exhausted and doing nothing meaningful just kept building up this creeping fear that my life had no meaning. Had nothing to do with the job at all.


I was looking for work without much luck up until this point. I've been doing some online work here and there, but I suspect it won't be enough to keep everything going so I've essentially just started applying anywhere now since I'm going to start feeling the financial strain soon.


The people you get to know in blue-collar jobs are pretty straight-forward. They look at jobs and productivity, and will jump at the chance to call someone lazy if they aren't working as hard as them. I think that's what keeps a lot of these guys going, working dead-end jobs they hate. They get into this mindset of self-praise for the hard work that they do. And how they work harder than Guy B. And how Guy C is a lazy POS. So on and so forth. My room mate got very angry at me for quitting recently. He essentially said I was being lazy and I haven't had a stable job and a long time and I should be more like him. We met at a previous job and he's been there for almost 4 years now. The problem with his argument, in my mind, is that he hates it too. He's always trying to leave early or take off. And somehow, even at my worst, I seem to do better financially than him. Don't get me wrong, this post isn't to rant about him. It's more about the criticisms the people around me have.


And I suppose it would be unfair to say that I'm NOT lazy. I don't enjoy doing things that I hate, in what seems like a fruitless cycle of ""work to live, live to work"". That's not an argument you can make around these people though. I guess I would have to come out in full disclosure of how fucked up I am, otherwise I'm just being lazy.


Reading through all of these job descriptions recently makes my life seem more and more bleak. I just don't get how things seem to make sense to everyone around me, but it just won't click in my head. People will work near a decade doing something they hate but continue the cycle. On my end, I've just entered this ""numb"" feeling where I'm convinced that I'm never going to understand any of it and I should just be looking for peace from life itself.

"Let me start off by saying that I wasn't always this way.  I used to be an advanced student in elementary school and had a passion for reading and learning; I could absorb knowledge and I had a social life. Then, things took a drastic change in 5th grade for no obvious reason.  I suddenly felt tired all the time; as if I didn't sleep enough.  All I could think was ""why am I so tired? I'll sleep more tonight"" every day.  For the first time in my life, I failed a test.  I broke down in tears in the middle of class and was surrounded in anxiety and depression.  I also somehow ""obtained"" adhd/extreme forgetfulness and started losing my ability to properly comprehend people speaking to me and use my mind's eye to visualize anything...  I was uninhibited in many social situations (my best friend's mom thought I was using drugs before I even knew what a marijuana was) and extremely anxious in others.  Stimulants didn't help much besides giving me energy and although anti-depressants help with my mood, all the other symptoms remain.  I have a feeling that this is a brain tumor or brain damage because of how it affects me so broadly.  I've never had suicidal thoughts and honestly, I don't think too much at all.  Nothing crisp, anyways.  I'm 19 now and not sure where to proceed from here.  My mom believes it's because I became an atheist and my dad thinks it's because I just don't care.
