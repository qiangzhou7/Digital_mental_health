"So I've got this friend that I talk to about everything. He knows more about me than probably any person on this earth. And he's super suicidal lately. 

I called 911 on him a few days ago for what could have been a suicide attempt. He was alright but idk. 

It's just scary man, like not knowing if he's gonna be there the next morning you know? 

And I just got hit with this realization last night that there's literally nothing I can do. I can be supportive but aside from that, I can't say or do anything to change his mind. And I mean it's stressing me out mate. 

Anyways idk why I'm saying this or what I hope to achieve by it. But yeah. Thanks guys. ",4,"I can be supportive but aside from that, I can't say or do anything to change his mind,suicidal lately, suicide attempt"
"Itâs currently 4 in the morning and Iâm feeling very stuck. I feel like nothing has changed since I can remember. For some background, Iâve had depression since about middle school. I guess I still donât know if I want to call it depression since I havenât been diagnosed yet but Iâve always just had trouble finding any positivity in my life. In school Iâve never been popular but I could be considered as well liked. From what I know most opinions of me are positive but as I said thatâs from what I know. My response to being sad has always been to try and focus on other peopleâs problems and try and help them. The problem with this is that all this has done is made me worse off. I feel like no one puts in as much effort into relationships as I do. Friends always seem to be eager to take my advice and then when I ask for help they run. The person I considered to be my best friend did this to me over the course of last year and Iâm still sad about it. We stopped talking for a few months and today they invited me to hang out with them on New Yearâs Eve but, while I still care about them, I donât want to put myself back  into a relationship where I put my all into it and then I ask for help and end up getting hurt. They tried to help me in the first 2 months that they knew about my depression (I feel like they actually did help me for the duration of the 2 months but for some reason that is hard to admit) and then after that he just gave up on me. That hurt more than anything else because I know I would never give up on him. In the absence of him for the last few months Iâve tried to go to counseling at my school. That worked for a week and then after some work I realized I should get a therapist to help. The counselor had to call one of my parents because, being a minor, I have to get parental consent to get a therapist. She never did. Itâs been about there weeks since she said she would do it. That really helps. Now Iâm stuck trying to solve my situation alone because Iâve been in it for so long that Iâve isolated myself from others. The point where I held a gun to my head and almost killed myself is when I think I finally realized something was very wrong with me mentality and I needed to do something about it. That was 6 months ago. Help feels like itâs so hard to find. My counselor hasnât helped, my parents havenât, and my past best friend hasnât. I also have other âfriendsâ that I found security in and then I realized that they talk about me behind my back and make fun of my depression. They also make fun of the same thing with another friend of mine who is in that group and that pisses me off more then them talking about me. 2017 has been the worst year of my life. At least I learned that I need help but itâs been so hard to find. Itâs made my depression worse and Iâm starting to lose hope again. In 2018 at the least Iâll try to look at things more positively this year. All that I know is that 2017 has taught me that good help is hard to find. That is why Iâm sitting here at 4am on a reddit account I just created venting to the void.
Thanks for reading my huge wall of text. I hope something in all of my rambling possibly related to you and helped a little bit. Good luck in 2018 and I hope this year works out for you. I know I need it to work out for me. Thanks again and have a happy New Year.

"I always look down or to the side of someone when I talk to someone because it actually hurts to look at them without feeling awkward or somehow disgusting. Very rarely a girl comes to sit by me at lunch at school and when she talks to me I can't help but look at my food constantly or just barely past her or at her shirt or hair to avoid eye contact. What is wrong with me?

"Constant fights over nothing, their psychotic breakdowns, how the always take their anger out on me, belittle me over innocent things, fight me to the point that I have to stay in hospital for 2 weeks, and always make me feel pathetic.

"She was abusive, and a huge contributor to my worsening depression. But for some reason I stayed with her for 5 years because she was my first.

I go to bed and I can't sleep because I am just always thinking about all the bad stuff she has done to me. She didn't let me have friends, she didn't let me socialize, she GPS tracked my location and I was convinced even by her family that It was normal. I couldn't go to a fast food restaurant without her screaming over the phone telling me I'm out with a friend or I'm cheating.

She changed my life for the better tho...she made me fight to better myself and my future. I wanted to start a family with her and have a home one day and give my kids a better future.

"I don't even know anymore. Being alone fucking sucks. Being everybody's last choice fucking sucks. BEING TOO SCARED TO MEET NEW PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TALK TO THEM WITHOUT HAVING A FUCKING PANIC ATTACK SUCKS. 11th of November. That's when my last real friend left me. Knew them for years, fought all the time. One day we kinda just drifted away and now we don't speak at all. It affected me a lot more, because they were all I fuckin had. Don't blame them. I'm a pessimistic, worthless, talentless idiot without anything good to say about myself. I can truly and wholeheartedly say without a doubt; 'I. HATE. MYSELF.' 

I don't know. I can laugh with people, I can joke around and forget everything. But sometimes it all gets too much and even if nothing happened that day, everything starts closing in on me and my heart starts beating faster and I just want to die. I dig my nails so hard into my legs and forearms that it draws blood and I shrink away wanting nothing more than to cry. But I don't. My friends either laugh at me or tell me it's bullshit and I'm just seeking attention. So I sit silently beating myself up with a blank expression, tearing up my own skin and planning a new suicide attempt.  

That's what it's like now. Nothing happened nothing FUCKING happened why is this happening to me I did nothing wrong I was OKAY, I was FINE but now I'm not and I want to die and I just..god. I can't even put it into words. I just want to die so much. So so much. My life is meaningless. I have no future to look forward to. I have no talents, no friends, nothing to live for. I haven't really done much these past few days. I haven't eaten since Saturday. I don't do anything productive. I've just laid in my bed with the blinds closed, staring at the fucking wall with drying blood on my hands and bandaged arms. No one notices. And no one WILL notice. Not until the neighbors notice the rotting smell in a few weeks. 

I suppose this is the end, right? I'll probably be dead and gone in a few days anyway. There's rope in my closet, pills in the bathroom, blades on my floor and a gun under my pillow.

"Hi. First, English is not my first language, so some sentences might be weird. I post here because there's no other place better than here. People in my country will definitely blame or laugh at me.

I thought I was one of those people who are strong enough to use social media. I don't care about others are having fun or eating in good restaurants, or bought luxury stuffs or have partners. 

But recently after I saw one of my old classmates becomes a professional translator and another becomes a writer who have published 2 novels, I start to doubt that. I feel uncomfortable. And I'm uncomfortable for feeling uncomfortable, because they were my friends. I feel awful. I don't know why. I feel shame. I think that although I have been knowing that I'm a loser, but it feels so much different when you see the real distance between you and others. It hurts.

A lots of people here suggest that it's better to just delete social medias. But that somehow makes me feel awful too. It's like, if I did it, it means I officially admitted I can't accept that others are getting successful but I am not. I feel there's a voice in my head laughing at me: ""Hey, look at what you want to do. You feel awful for seeing others being successful, and your way to solve this is, ha, to delete your social media? Instead of getting inspired and start to work hard and get your shit together? You just ganna run away? Pathetic!"".

Some people say ""It's not pathetic, it's for your mental health"" but I still feel pathetic for thinking about that I have to use this way to protect myself.

"I don't even know how or where to start but I NEED to get a lot off my chest. 

My ideal life has always been to have a happy family. But I'm a very shy person, and never really liked the social scene. It makes it really hard to meet new people, but by a stroke of luck i met the most amazing girl back on September 30 2001(i was 18). We quickly fell in love, had a daughter, and got married. I thought we were a match made in heaven. I loved my life, i had everything i ever wanted. She made me want to be the best person i could be. I love this woman with every fiber of my being, but in early 2007 we hit our first road bump. She said she was unhappy and wanted a divorce. I tried everything to repair our marriage. I spent thousands of dollars on couples counseling, therapy, and spent every waking moment trying to resolve our issues. I found out 6 months into or troubles that she was sneaking around behind my back and sleeping with an old friend of hers from school(while we were still married). Even with that being the case, i still tried to fix our relationship because all i ever wanted was a complete family and for her to be happy. I guess her mind was made up though, because right after new years 2008 she gave me divorce papers. I love her and didn't want to fight it and cause her anymore stress so i signed the divorce papers bawling like a baby. The divorce was pretty much a 50/50 split but i let her take everything but our daughter and my PC, again because all i wanted was for her to be happy. Hell, i didn't even ask for child support even though i did everything for our daughter. I still tried to talk to her and let her know she was still very much loved, but soon after the divorce she remarried to the guy she cheated on me with. So, for the last 10 years i have been alone with just me and my daughter. I've tried to meet new women but i can't seem to find anyone that wants to be with me for more than a couple dates. I think it's because my depression, but i don't know. I haven't even had sex since 2007. I've tried apps and going to bars, but i don't drink alcohol so i feel awkward. I'm tired of being alone. I was raised by my grandparents and they have since passed on. I have NOBODY in my life that loves me besides my daughter. I want to find someone that can love me and my little girl as much as i could love them, but @ 35 years old it's beginning to feel impossible. Why won't anyone love me back? What is wrong with me? How can i find someone to love? I'm scared of dying alone. I'm worried my heart will remain broken till my death. I'm not a bad guy. I work very hard to make sure my daughter is happy, but without a proper mother figure i fear her life will mirror mine, and honestly if it wasn't for her i would've bitten the bullet years ago. She is all i have left. No siblings, no parents, no cousins or in-laws. I have nobody...

"As the title suggests I could really use some advice. Iâve been struggling with depression for years, with this latest episode affecting me since mid-November. It is now January 2018 and although Iâve had some good times and didnât really feel depressed over the Holidays, it all just came flooding back last night.

All of my friends ended up bailing on me on New Years so I spent the night alone in my room until I fell asleep around 9 pm. I woke up around 3 in the morning and stupidly checked my phone. When I did I saw all the friends that bailed on me at different parties, surrounded by others, having fun. This sent me spiraling back into depression and I found myself close to ending my life with a belt which Iâve read can be very painless. I was able to take some medication that helped me go to sleep again and get through the night.

Itâs now 1:30 in the afternoon and I still feel the same way with absolutely nobody to talk to about this because I donât want to be that person that brings somebody down on New Years.

It just feels as if no matter what medications I take, whatever therapist I have, and even with these group therapy sessions Iâve been attending, I always end up back on the train to death. Itâs starting to feel like the only solution as Iâve tried making some major changes in my life and none of them have made any impact when others have told me they would.

He has never tried to share any of his own problems with me. Ever. It was even like this when I was still dating him.

When he texts me first, it's to ask how I'm doing.

To cut a long story short, I've had this crush on a girl for well over a year now. Not a day goes by when I don't think about her and checking her social media accounts has became part of my daily routine. She lives overseas and there is a significant age difference, I'm 15 and she's 20. 


For a few hours after I wake up, she's all I think about and it causes a nauseating feeling in my stomach. (Also, has anyone else been through this or know what it is?)

Unlike most crushes, I recognise her flaws. She's passive aggressive, a humble bragger, a control freak, a spoilt girl who grew up in a mansion. But she's not an awful person, far from. I relate to her in so many ways. That's how I can see through her little act. She's insecure about her appearance and how people perceive her and has admitted to being depressed in the past. 


I only know her through her social media presence. But I'm certain I would make her so happy if I were her boyfriend. I'd take care of her, let her cry in my arms and vent about her problems all night. I'd take care of her.


I suppose some things aren't meant to be, we live in different countries, we're different ages and she doesn't even fucking know me. Despite this, I can't just get over her and move on. I can't even distract myself, all I think about is her. Like I've said, I've been this way for years. Is this fate trying to tell me there is a chance or just my depression trying to beat me down and get me to get my hopes up?


Anyone been through anything like this or know how to move forward? Also, sorry about the cringe-worthy ""I'd be good the best boyfriend"" speech I typed out earlier. I know it's so clichÃ©, but I think it needed to be said. 


Oh, and happy New Years!",4,"social media presence, she's all I think about, a nauseating feeling"

"I started to think recently on how toxic my parent's behavior has been over the years, but since every time I tried to call them out they dismissed me I struggled with seeing those things as emotionally abusive, just a clash of personalities with them being overly harsh and me being overly sensitive, and I feel guilty since I know they love me and have always provided for me and that there are people that have much worse parents. I started to list out the things my father done, since they started earlier(around when I was 7-ish) than my mother's and I believe have been much more impactful:

* Made fun of me to the ladies working at a clothing store's changing area because I didn't know how to tie my shoelaces

* Yelled at me for spilling a soft drink on my shirt

* Yelled at me whenever I got the answer wrong when helping me with math one time

* Broke a game's cd rom in front of me because he could not figure out the puzzle

* Yelled at me for throwing a soft drink can on the garbage at school because I struggled to open it and was too shy to ask for help

* Yelled at me for letting kids at class use my empty water bottle to mix things different drinks in

* Grounded me on summer vacation because my cousin was bossing me around but didn't say a word to my cousin or my uncle

* Yelled at me in front of extended family in christmas and told me to go to bed early because one of the kids was bossing me around

* Never tried to hide that he puts his siblings over us, said christmas without them is not christmas, and once we didn't even celebrated it because my mother wanted just the four of us at home and he got angry about it. Always antagonizes us when he's around his family and makes us feel like burdens and annoyances to them.

* Told me I have shit on my head because I forgot to bring a coat when spending a whole day at my friend's house, never mind the fact that it was just two blocks away from mine and my father would drive me back.

* Once me and my brother were bickering and I accidentally hit his glasses, he shouted so my father entered the room, yelled and made us sleep early.

* When I came out I asked for a gender therapist or just someone with experience with trans patients, he got me a therapist who never had a trans patient before and was obsessed with having me remember the event in my childhood that triggered by dysphoria and dismissed my body issues because ""women have body hair too"" instead of actually helping me.

* I found a gender therapist so I gave him her contact info and said I wanted to see her instead, he said he'd call her. Months after I asked him about it, he just tells me she's ""biased""

* Up until I was 18 he'd always force me to get a haircut once my hair was long enough to partially cover my ears, my hair was always thick and hard to manage and he always gave me shit about it. One time he thought I asked the hairdresser to just trim the absolute minimum and went on a fit about how if I wanted to cut my dick off that's fine but he was not going to be a part of it.

* To this day he acts like me coming out never happened, the last he commented on it was years ago saying that I should study, find a job and then I can do anything I want to. I opened up despite how painful it was in the time I need his help the most and he just removed himself from that responsibility.

* Mocked the way I speak by mimicking me in a tone of voice as if he was imitating a disabled person more than once

ï»¿* He knows I'm scared of elevators since I'm 5 but always dismissed it, one day as a teen we were on one and the door kept opening and closing, it was fairly crowded with a baby stroller no less, I begged him to let us leave because I was terrified, he then yelled at me in front of everyone and told me he'd never take me out again.

* Around the same time we were on a mall's bookstore, he showed me a book but I wasn't interested, partially because of being severely depressed, he flipped at me and ran to the parking area to leave, with the rest of us having to follow him. Then went on a rant all the way back home.

* I lost count of how many mornings I woke up during a weekend to him washing the dishes while complaining at how much of a failure I am

* Dismissed and belittled my concerns, fears and problems over the years always saying something like ""what are you going to do about it"".

* Belittles my interests for being childish according to him.

* Get's angry at me for being scared of bugs and other ""feminine"" attitudes.

* Always makes me into the unreasonable one whenever I got visibly upset or angry at his behavior that he never apologizes for

* Always acts like he knows me better than I know myself, always sees malice in my thoughts and actions because ""he was once my age"". He never believes I'm genuine with the things I want or do, I'm always doing things because everyone is doing it.

* Constantly lies about things like pretending he took the dog to the vet, that he could not find something we asked him to buy, etc.

* Always use us as his emotional and verbal punching bags when he's frustrated at something or someone

* I always have to compromise, like not transitioning or always having my hair up now that it's long, but he never makes an effort to change or police himself on the things I've said that bother me over the years.

* To this day whenever he raises his voice or get angry even if I have nothing to do with it I get panicky.

* I feel like I have to walk on eggshells with him, if I say the wrong thing (speak my mind) or react the wrong way(react naturally) he's going to flip on me.

I was close to my father when I was very very young but the behaviors I listed started happening around when I was 6-7 so it's pretty much since then that I started to become distant, he feels like a stranger to me since I was about 14. With my mother we were pretty close and got along very well up until I was about 14. She's always been an anxious and jealous person but the bad things that happened in her past plus a lot of stress over the years made her insufferable. On top of anxious and jealous she's controlling, critical and judgemental. If I don't do things her way she won't stop criticizing me, if I call her out she starts pointing out my flaws. She's always looking for a opportunity to turn anything into a fight and then play victim and make everything about herself. If I get angry at her she just says I'm crazy and need to go to a mental asylum. She told me so many hurtful things over the years since I came out, that I'm retarded, that I'm a curse in her life, that she should have been a whore instead of a proper woman, etc. I can tell she regrets it after as she tries to hug and kiss me but she never apologizes. 

I know deep down they both love me and want the best for me, they had always provided and praised me and done what they could but when it comes to the emotional side of things I think they managed to break me completely while being completely oblivious to it, always suggesting I'm ""tired"" and ""moody"" due to a poor diet and lack of exercise and wondering why I'm like this or why I feel so uncomfortable next to them. I'm severely depressed, have social and some general anxiety to the point I'm practically a shut in right now with no will to live, I get that there are things I could do do make my life better, I just don't see the point anymore.",4,"emotionally abusive, walk on eggshells with him, complaining ,Dismissed ,belittled ,Made fun, Yelled, Mocked, jealous"
"Was with some friends, feeling really really depressed as usual at this point, and I left as soon as the ball drops. Get home and tell her im scared of another year with depression. She told me that I put too much pressure on her. She then says she doesn't want to be in a relationship right now. I like her so much. I tried to overdose on my zoloft but my mom stopped me. She won't take me to the hospital. I just turned 17 and this is the third year I've been dealing with depression. I want to hug somebody I'm so sad ",4,"she doesn't want to be in a relationship, want to hug somebody, so sad "
"2017 was rough. My brain fell into cycles of self degradation way too easily, this led me down a spiral this year which made me end a long relationship, lose some friends, and made me put duties that would have helped me to the wayside like taking my dog out.

The past few months leading to now has been anti social to say the least. I stopped trying to make plans with friends as I was tired of hearing no, my friends clearly didn't want me around a whole lot (since September I had a total of 2 outings with friends, pre September we spent probably too much time together at ~6 days a week). On top of that another good friend of mine moved away indefinitely. 

2017 I realized I can't rely on my friends the way I thought I could, I wish I could but life doesn't work like that. My New Years resolution this year is to not base my happiness and social success around if my friends and I are having fun. I've realized I don't need my friends to go play an open Mic night, or go see a movie, or to go for a hike, in fact a lot of these are better done alone.

2017 my friends left me high and dry

2018 they're not gonna be able to",4,"friends left me high and dry, self degradation done alone "
"For the past few days, I've been miserable. Hit a new low kinda miserable. My parents snapped at me, not knowing so. They threatened to kick me out and so i just walked out. Grabbed my pack and just ran. They tried to bring me back. T'was a whole chase scene with jumping over walls and shet. 

But i couldn't. After however many hours, I went back. I never got anything when I returned but a single lecture about how nobody is gonna care if I do it again bc I'm 19. They're probably right.

Word travels fast in my family, and I believe I've ruined New Years for everyone. I dont want to face everyone anymore. None of them understand what I'm going through. I have no friends to talk to anymore. My brother and sister ignore me and dont like me. My parents also ignore what I'm going through and suggest that I shouldnt be depressed bc theyre depressed even more. All my aunts and uncles who think they help say that too. 

Im rambling at this point...

Right now, im laying in my bed, legs sore, body numb, and drowning in despair. I dont know where to go. I want to end it but im afraid to. I want leave but i dont know where to go. And even if i do, i wont know how to start my life back again and for that, I'm scared. Even so, im considering doing things i would never have done before.

This was a long post. Any help would be greatly appreciated if I get any. Just ranting a bit and knowing this is out to the world helps just a little.",4,"parents snapped, threatened, kick me out, Miserable, low ,body numb, and drowning in despair"
I have major depressive disorder. I'm going through an episode. But this time I seem to be getting really mad at my boyfriend for seemingly no reason... he hasn't done anything wrong I've just been so frustrated with his existence lately but I don't want to be without him... this scares me and I want to stop feeling angry at him and go back to feeling nothing but love for him. Help?,4,"seem to be getting really mad at my boyfriend for seemingly no reason, he hasn't done anything wrong I've just been so frustrated with his existence lately but I don't want to be without him"
"So my ''friends'' made a huge new years party, like the biggest in our small town. I've never been the biggest party type, but a simple text would've been nice. So now january 1st comes and they all want to hang out with me because noone is going out today. I never have had many friends, but i was fine with that, because i only kept the real ones with me. How can i find new people atleast to hang out with? (btw i'm quite a big introvert so i know it won't be easy) ",4,"ever have had many friends, no one,introvert"
"My depression has been up and down over the past 2 years. I've hit my lowest lows, but bounced back towards the highest highs. Recently it seems like I'm slowly going back down, and there's no incline in sight. If everything keeps going the way it is, I'll be farther down than I've ever been. When I was at my lowest, I was pretty ready to take my life. I felt almost a sensation of peace over myself knowing that soon enough I'll never have to feel this way again. I ended up not going through with it, and I talked myself away from those feelings for a good while, and I was feeling good. 

Now I have a kid on the way, almost halfway to the due date, and I'm going back down in the rut. It makes me feel like a complete piece of shit, but knowing that I can't just end it anymore is making it harder to deal with. In the past I've always had suicide as a plan if all else failed, and it made me feel a bit better knowing, if anything, it could all end. But with a kid on the way, I don't dare even think about it. I wouldn't want to have her resent me, or feel guilty in anyway, and now I can't seem to get over this feeling. 

On top of it all, my wife knows of my depression, but overall it feels like it's just a burden to her. I don't even want to talk to her about it anymore because it makes me feel like I'm just complaining and loathing in my own self pity. I'm just stuck where I am, and I hate it more than anything. 

As is, I don't have insurance, or really any money, so I can't seek out medical help. The only other people who I know that have depression is my mom and a friend. But my friend just makes jokes about it, and I have too high of anxiety to talk to my mom about it.

I guess this wasn't really going anywhere, but I needed to get it off of my chest, so thanks.",4,"judgemental tone, cuts me off from everyone, Intense, internal conflict, loneliness, sleeping problems, feelings of worthlessness, laziness , intrusive thoughts"
Even though some of my friends tell me otherwise I still feel guilty of what I've done and unworthy of everything,4,"some of my friends tell me otherwise, still feel guilty, unworthy"
"I want to tell someone, ""HEY LOOK WHAT I'M DOING!"" but I don't have anyone here, so I'd like to tell y'all â¡

It's a sunny day, but cold. I'm going to go for a walk and look for some geocaches. It was hard to figure out what to do today, because I didn't want to do the activities that I was going to do with other people before they flaked on me. 

Going for a walk holds no appeal, but it seems healthier than sitting in my room being anxious.  So, go me! I'm gonna go put my warm clothes on now. I'll update y'all with my resolution progress if that isn't too annoying.

"I went to a New Years Party last night with some people I hadn't seen in a while and I felt so out of place the whole time.  Not to mention, the girl I was interested in was clearly eyeing up a far more attractive guy.  I had hoped this would help me find new friends in addition to connecting with her but I feel like I failed at both.  I just want someone to think I deserve to be loved but I've never felt like I should be.  2018 is already shaping up to be awful and I can't handle another year like this.  I wish I could be loved, and I'm not even talking about sex here, I mean someone whom I can show them how much I care or whatever I dunno.  Hugs and stuff.  I feel pathetic typing this out but I don't know what to do.",4,"went to a New Years Party last night with some people I hadn't seen in a while,felt so out of place the whole time,had hoped this would help me find new friends in addition to connecting with her but I feel like I failed at both,deserve to be loved but I've never felt like I should be"
