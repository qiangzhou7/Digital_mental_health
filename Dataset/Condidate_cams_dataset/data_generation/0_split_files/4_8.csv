"Itâs like thereâs some fucking hole in me I canât ever permanently fill. I feel like a hollow shell. Sure I can do shit to distract myself from it, but when Iâm alone with my thoughts and nothing else, I just feel so lonely and empty. Distractions temporarily fill up that stupid hole. I can watch TV all day and not think about it too much. I can go out and get drunk. I can listen to music. But the minute the distractions are gone Iâm just stuck with myself, and Iâm just there. Just existing. None of it actually matters; I donât actually have any passion or will to live. Iâm just scraping by and trying to forget about how shitty I feel.

Thereâs one thing Iâve found makes me feel completely fine, if only temporarily; infatuation. I fall head over heels for girls, and I think itâs definitely linked to how shitty I feel. The thing is though Iâm a virgin. All these crushes go unrequited, and they only get worse. In high school they were pretty tame, but since leaving Iâve had 2 massive ones that basically took over my life for their duration, one thatâs still going on right now. The first one the girl wasnât ever really interested in me. She was friendly enough, and we clicked a little, but it was always this forced awkwardness to it. I barely knew her, not really. We never had anything but surface level conversations. It didnât go anywhere at all, but I built the whole thing up so much in my head that it took me months and months to get over her.

Then I became friends with this other girl. Real, genuine friends, which is rare for me. I found someone I have a genuine connection with. It made me feel amazing that Iâm capable of that deep connection. And instead of being able to just enjoy that, my stupid fucking brain makes me fall for her. Sheâs literally my best friend man, and Iâm hopelessly into her. Sheâs the only one I ever open up to, even if itâs just a little. But she has a boyfriend, and while sure we get along great and support each other and shit, I know somewhere deep down she just doesnât see me that way. But it doesnât matter. Cause that holeâs there. And while sheâs in my life, itâs filled. And as pathetic as it sounds, itâs kind of worth the pain of seeing the girl youâre so into being with someone else, because at least Iâm not alone. I have someone to message all day. Someone who cares whether Iâm actually alive. Someone who depends on me. It means the world.

But itâs just not healthy. Itâs a temporary solution to a permanent problem.  The problem is that Iâm just fucking broken somehow. Iâm just empty inside. And even though being around her makes me feel like Iâm someone worth a damn, someone that I could grow to like, really deep down Iâm still hollow man. And seeing her with someone else kills me, just in a different way. But itâs either that or go back to feeling completely alone. And the thing is, no girl wants a guy whoâs this down on himself and lacking in self-confidence.

People always say that you need to love yourself before you can love someone else, but it feels like my flaw as a person is that I canât love myself unless I feel like someone else does. But nobody ever truly does. So I take the closest I can get and cling to it desperately, because if I donât Iâm just alone with myself. Why the fuck am I like this? I feel like my full life Iâm gonna go through this cycle over and over. It just sucks. I hate myself even more for being that asshole whoâs hopelessly into a girl with a boyfriend. I feel like one of those stupid ânice guysâ for even complaining about her not feeling the same. But I just wish that once somebody would feel for me the same way I feel for them. I look for that love thinking it will fix me, but honestly I donât think it would. I donât know how to fix it in all honesty.",4,"pathetic as it sounds, itâs kind of worth the pain of seeing the girl youâre so into being with someone else, because at least Iâm not alone"
"When I was in highschool the same thing, I was kind of happy to be around other people at school but obviously couldnât wait for the day to be over so I could go home. When I would get home I would just feel empty and lonely and sad. I remember when I met my first and only ever girlfriend, My depression literally disappeared the moment I met her. She left me 8 months later and there is a very good chance I will never speak to her again. Itâs been 3 months and I thought I was depressed before I had ever met a girl, but my god, the depression is 10x worse after I had one and she left. Iâm so lonely even sometimes when Iâm with friends Iâm lonely. I canât take this anymore. ",4,She left me 8 months later and there is a very good chance I will never speak to her again
"As the topic says i hate my life, nothing is positive and everthing sucks. My so called friends lie to me, forgets about me. I recently met a woman that i connected with in a way i have never experienced. We talked about everything, both positive things and all the negative things we have experienced. She told me she have never met someone like me and that we got to know each other was ment to for both our sakes. A day ago she told me she dont want anything to do with me.. just my luck. Maybe i am not supposed to live in this world? Seems like what ever i do people just takes a shit on my life and feelings. I am so fcking tired of this happening time after time after fcking time.

tl;dr: People hate me, should i stay alive?",4,day ago she told me she dont want anything to do with me

"~~I apologize if this does not qualify for this subreddit, but I don't know of a better place to talk about this.~~

I never felt like my family truly loved me. They say they do, but all the times that they interact with me feel fake, like they're just pretending to like me for appearances. This is what my gut is telling me, but I don't know if it's reliable.

I wonder if I'm a sociopath. Everyone loves their family, right? So why can't I?

I hate a certain half sister of mine because, growing up, she would always call me names, make fun of me, and just generally treat me like garbage. But anyone I would complain about this to never thought this was anything to complain about. They would be like ""Oh, that's just how sisters are"" and ""Oh, I understand. Me and my siblings fought a lot too, but we still love each other.""

The thing is, I can say with confidence that I DON'T love my sister. At best, I'm indifferent to her. At worst, I want to kill her. But I certainly do not ""love"" her.  I told her this and...it apparently made her cry.

Wait...are you serious? You expected me to love you after the way you've treated me my whole life? Am I crazy to not love being bullied? Am I just weak for not being able to tolerate this so called ""typical sibling banter""??? I need answers, damn it!!

Then there's my father. He's...an asshole. He just is. I really don't feel like getting into how he's an asshole, since I just got through talking about my sister. But anyway...

 Unlike my sister, nobody denies that he's an asshole. However, I am expected to put up with him anyway. Because my father is 71 years old (turning 72 next month), he has been deemed ""a product of his time"" and therefore is allowed to be an asshole because old people are too old to listen and therefore
 I should ""pity him"" because ""he's a lonely old man"". 

But here's the thing: I DO pity him. Of course I do, he's a pathetic human being. But pity =/= tolerate, which is what they're implying when they tell me this. I don't know why they expect me to tolerate this outdated piece of human history when obviously the best option is to throw him in a museum (retirement home) and let him expire. I don't know how I'm an asshole for feeling this way, but I guess I just am.

Those are the main two people that I hate out of this family, but I honestly don't care for any of them. I never felt like I truly belonged in this family. I was always ""the quiet one"" that everyone ignored. I often fantasize about ditching these people and moving to another part of the country, and meet people that I can ""truly connect with"", but of course that'll never happen.  For one, ""truly connecting"" with people would require me to socialize, and I'm as asocial as they come. Two, I'm such an emotionally weak, weak-willed, codependent piece of crap that the very idea of moving away and being all alone is too much for me to bear.  

I'm sure I probably just sound like a whiny spoiled brat to you all.You're probably wondering: If I don't have the guts to ditch them, why don't I just deal with them? Well, they clearly never wanted to deal with me all my life, so why should I?.......................Right?...RIGHT???

I don't know... What am I saying? I don't even know what I want...

Obviously, there's something I don't like about my family, but I don't know what it is, so nothing will ever change...... What if there's actually nothing wrong with them?....What if I'M the problem? What If I'm just a horrible person that will never be satisfied no matter what I do? If I can't be satisfied with what I have, do I just not deserve happiness? I don't know when I became so terrible....Wasn't I always like this? They say no one is born evil, but...look at me....

I'm not sure why I typed all of this out, I doubt anyone will read it...and if you did, sorry for wasting your time...

"My mom is a crazy psychotic bitch who can barely take care of herself. I can't tell you how many times I've overheard my mom talking bad about me to others, calling me weird, a freak, etc. all because, well, I don't know why she doesn't like me. But, a good mother would accept her son any way that he is. My older brother is a narcissistic, arrogant asshole who I can't spend more than 3 minutes talking to before my head wants to explode because he does't actually listen to anything I ever say and still treats me like I'm 10. But guess fucking what? He's the favorite of my family. My grandpa and grandma, though they would never admit, clearly favorite him quite a lot compared to my sister, cousins and myself. Every time I go to a family dinner it's anything but family time because a huge argument always occurs at the table, which causes my grandma or aunt to get upset and cry. I don't know why they always have to argue over something. Also, I'm going to art school in the fall and nobody takes my art passion at all serious because I'm not choosing to follow the same typical conventional path as everyone else and become a lawyer/doctor/teacher or something similar.

Long story short, once I graduate High School (I'm 18 and a Senior) I'm moving out of my house and into an apartment with some friends and will be dissociating myself from them for the most part, not that most of them will actually care.",4,My mom is a crazy psychotic bitch who can barely take care of herself
"I apologize for the long/whiny post but I need to vent.  Hopefully this helps clear my head so I can get some sleep tonight. 

About a week ago I was talking with a friend (I will call him Derek) and the topic of New Year's came up. I told Derek that I did not have any plans at which point his girlfriend (Kim) suggested that I join them on a trip up north to hang out with her friend (Sara), whom Kim tried to set me up with about a year ago but I was just not in a good place to start dating and within a few weeks she was dating someone else (Ken).  At this time Derek let me know that Kim wanted to set us up again. I recently, about three weeks ago, I got the dreaded ""I just want to be friends"" from another woman that I had been hanging out with for a little over a month.  This made me a little hesitant since it had not been too long since the rejection, but I agreed to go.  The plan was to go up Sunday afternoon, stay the night at Sara's, and leave Monday morning.

Fast forward to the Sunday night and we are at a house part hosted by one of Sara's friends.  It is still early and I find myself talking with Kim at the party, Kim is asking me if I am interested in Sara and I tell her I am.  She gets a huge smile on her face as she was talking with Sara earlier and she was interested in me.  At this point my head is going crazy, I am probably the happiest I have been in years, I start to think finally something good is happening.  Midnight comes around and Sara and I are standing next to each other, the countdown ends and for some reason I cannot pull the trigger and kiss her.  I am an idiot. 

Of course, the party continues and I go outside with Derek to smoke a cigarette (cope) thinking that I blew it with this awesome girl.  We come back in and mingle with the other party-goers.  I find myself talking with Sara alone, we talk for a while and then in the middle of our conversation she leans in a kisses me.  I am back on cloud nine, I didn't screw this up.  It is about 1:00 AM now and we head out as Sara has to be to work at 5:00 AM.  

We get back to Sara's place and start getting ready for bed, I am in Sara's room with her as Kim and Derek climb onto the air mattress in the living room, the original sleeping arrangements were for Kim to sleep in Sara's room on an air mattress and Derek and I were to sleep on a couch and air mattress in the living room.  So there Sara and I are sitting on her bed and we say goodnight, and she looks at the air mattress that was setup on her floor.  I get the hint and climb in, I don't think too much of it as this is the first night that we have really hung out and the fact that she has to wake up in 2.5 hours.

The next morning; Kim, Derek, and I wake up and clean up Saraâs house.  We decide that we should grab some breakfast before heading home, Kim texts Sara to see if she would like us to bring her anything which she does.  It dawns on me that in all of the excitement of the night I never asked Sara for her number, I am determined to get it before leaving.  We get to Saraâs office and head in, she is there with one other coworker.  As we say our goodbyes she hugs me and then as I am about to ask for her number someone says something to her and she looks away.  I lose all the confidence that I had to ask and leave.  

The drive home is hell, all I can think about is how I missed my chance after what was probably the best night off my life in 10 years.  Kim drops Derek and myself off at Derekâs and he asks me why I didnât ask her for her number I tell him that I didnât want to ask in front of her coworker, which is half true.  He says that he will talk to Kim who will in turn talk to Sara and send me her number.  I hate this as it is like I am back in high school but it is the only option I have.  
I do not hear back from Derek on Monday night and my head goes straight to the worse possible reason, Sara wants nothing to do with me.  I talk myself down from that scenario as Derek and I had made plans for Tuesday.  Tuesday comes around and Derek and I hang out, I do not bring up anything with Sara the entire time until it is time to leave.  I ask Derek if Kim had talked to her and he breaks the news; Ken, Saraâs ex, is moving back to town.  This is information that Kim knew prior to inviting me, but she does not want Sara to get back together with Ken so she was hoping that we would hit it off and that she would not want to get back with her ex.  


So now here I am, feeling awful, rejected two times in a month.  How could something be going so right and end so abruptly?  I am not sure if Sara wants to get back together with her ex or as I was told her ex coming back to town is just messing with her head and she doesnât want to get hurt again.  Kim and Derek said that they would talk with her and let me know but now I feel like I shouldnât even try anymore, it always ends the same.",4,"feeling awful, rejected two times in a month"

"I've (31/F) struggled with depression my whole life. Grew up in an abusive home, had abusive relationships, bad marriages, etc..I've even tried committing suicide a couple of times. I've been to therapists for the better part of 30 years, and I've been on every antidepressant they could prescribe, with little positive results. It just doesn't help. I've been pretty okay for the last year or so, though. In fact, I've been happy... I started writing poetry again, and started teaching myself ASL. I felt hopeful for a future. But I've hit a low now that's lower than low. Lower than I've ever been, and my husband has basically told me to either kill myself already, check myself into a ward, or shut  up. I know, it's not exactly the supportive phrase you want to hear when you're already depressed, but there it is. I'm not going to kill myself, that I know. I've got two kids, and I can't. But I find myself with this incredible urge to run away- just disappear and never come back. And I don't want to do that either, because I love my kids. I don't want to die, I just don't want to live anymore, if that makes sense... 
Anyway, I'm going to check myself into a psych ward, but I'm scared. I don't know what to expect. If you've ever been to one, could you please share your experience? What were you there for, how long did you stay, and did it help? Please be kind here. I can't take much more negativity right now. I just need to know what I'm in for. Thank you.

"Been with my boyfriend for a year now, and after getting out of an abusive relationship with my ex of 4 years. 

A lot happened to me, and I'm still trying to cope. Since then, I've been switching medications, weaning off, increasing, etc. My moods are all over the place, and recently I've been crying over everything. 

My boyfriend thinks I'm overreacting and I should move on from the sexual and emotional abuse I experienced for years. He has never understood what it's like to battle depression, and I can't find a way to show him it's more than being ""sad"" over ""stupid"" things that happened in the past. 

Recently, I've been diagnosed with tuberculosis, had to quit my job due to hostile work conditions, can't go back to the medical field now because of the TB, out of money and relying on my parents, I have no friends, can't make friends because everyone around here is an asshole, struggling with weight problems for the first time in my life, still trying to wrap my head around the fact I was raped, and a lot of other issues that just keep piling up. 

I don't know what to do. He doesn't take me seriously, which leads to arguments, which then leads to me crying, and he can't deal with crying. He says I cry too much, I need to stop letting everything bother me. Duh, I'm trying?

"Words cannot describe the emptiness I feel inside. The only emotions I can feel are guilt, self-hatred, anxiety, depression, and regret. I remember when taking a walk on a nice day would be pleasant. Now it's 4Â°F outside and the sun hurts my eyes. I remember when fresh snow used to look so mesmerizing and fragile. But now I look outside my window, see fresh snow and I think ""Fuck this white bullshit. I can't drive my barely working car in this.""  
Not that I would go and drive anywhere anyway. Nobody wants anything to do with me. People at my school see me as a freak, a social outcast. I wear all black most of the time with bandannas and necklaces. Y'know. The ""Dylan Klebold"" type of kid. Might as well carry a TEC-9.
 Nobody ever approaches me, and if they do it's just bullshit small talk or they are forced to talk to me because of some school group assignment. Also, to put it lightly...I'm not very photogenic. I'm 6'2'' 120lb male. Skin and bones. I'm blindingly pale and have a lazy eye, I can thank my dad's genes for that &gt;:[ And every girl I've ever tried to get has gone after the stereotypical football player hottie with big biceps. I've faced nothing but constant rejection. From everyone. From my friends, family, my teachers, and even myself. Hell, even my fucking *mailman* rejects me. My package has been sitting in your office for three days. I might as well walk the 3.4 miles down to the post office and get it my damn self. What the fuck man?

Anyways....I just wanna disappear to a far away tropical island for a few months with nobody but my crush and a fuck load of drugs. But that'll never happen. I've never been able to have what I want. I had a fucked up childhood, witnessed my mother throw a vacuum cleaner at my father when I was 6 years old scared and shaking in the corner. My half sisters always pestered the hell out of me, which I think is part of the reason I can't talk to girls well. 

I've felt depressed since I was about 14. But every year it slowly eats away at you, and here I am at 18 years old. A legal adult who is a hard drug addict, is essentially broke and works minimum wage, spends any/all income on useless bullshit like the newest adidas shoes or the newest video game, or drugs. Mostly drugs. Ive spent thousands on weed, benzos, blow, acid, shrooms, ecstasy, cigarettes, you name it. I've done it. All besides opiates, meth, crack, and that synthetic weed shit that makes people go ballistic. 
I started young too. Took my first hit of weed at 15, tried ecstasy and LSD at 16, coke at 17, and it all went from there. I haven't been sober in years. I've fried my brain. And I can't stop. I'm heavily addicted to benzos and drinking(more so benzos). It's the only thing that stops the nasty thoughts. The pills are the only thing that make my awful thoughts stop. Every day I think of a way I could potentially kill myself. But I've never acted on it. But I'm afraid I might have the balls to do it one of these days and end this constant suffering. My mind is pitch black. The lights are on, but nobody's home. I'm a ghost. I'm a shell of the person I used to be. 

Just wanted to get this off my chest. Any replies are greatly appreciated. But don't ask me to go and seek medical help, I'm already in the process. Sometimes I feel like it's making it worse, considering the USA's healthcare system is fucked.

"Hello. 16F here. I have been treated for my ADHD with various doses of Vyvanse for the past several years and I currently am prescribed 50 mg.

I abused and misused my medication this summer. Going back to school, I was no longer able to do that and I had to go back to my intended dosage. The adjustment was very difficult, and I completely withdrew from friends, would sleep excessively (5/3pm-6am most nights), and felt very fatigued and indifferent for about a month until I finally got used to being back on that dose. Still not sure if what I was feeling was withdrawal or not

I have never brought this up with my mental health provider in fear of losing her trust and fear of being taken off Vyvanse. 

On December 8th my father died. I had a very difficult relationship with him and a complicated childhood as a whole (alcoholism, parents weren't around, all that stuff). He lived in another country at the time of his passing, so I missed the last weeks of school to be with his family in his home country and I arrived back in the states on Xmas. 

I cannot be around my friends without Vyvanse. I zone out in my own thoughts, I resent them and find no joy in being around them. I feel so disconnected and alone from them, even though they are supportive.  On New Years, I was at a close friends get together and I felt like this and I went to the bathroom and for the first time had intense urges to self-harm. Called home, left the party, and got drunk alone instead.

I feel like I live in these two worlds as who I am medicated and who I am not medicated. Nobody knows the real me because of how different my personality is on Vyvanse, even I donât know the ârealâ me I've been on this drug so long. When I crash from Vyvanse now, I feel like Im in a dark deep hole. When I'm not on Vyvanse, I'm dissatisfied with everyone and everything around me, including myself. the only time I'm happy is when im on amphetamines. 

i cannot sleep anymore and I get about two hours every night. no sex drive at all and I am losing all my friends. I am just so exhausted.

Is this depression? Or just grief? 

Also is it likely my therapist will take me off my adhd meds if she finds out i previously abused them? ",4,"had a very difficult relationship with him and a complicated childhood as a whole (alcoholism, parents weren't around, all that stuff)"
"A close friend of mine, over the internet, told me that she was sorry. This was out of the blue, because the last time we talked we were really happy. I asked what for, and she said she broke a promise.

I didn't understand, but then she said she hurt herself. I asked her why and she said she just did deserve it. I tried my best, but she just ended with ""I'm sorry"". I attempted to convince her, since I have a history with suicide attempts and depression. She said ""I can't promise anything"". She wanted to go offline for a while, so I just wanted to let her know how I felt. 

I told her ""I love you."" and she said ""I love you too"". She isn't single, she's dating my friend, but I have a huge crush on her, and we are really close. It happened 4 hours ago from when I posted this, and I'm extremely concerned what happened. ""I love you too"" is the last thing she said to me. She hasn't said anything since, and I feel extremely depressed because I may have been unable to stop my closest friend from committing suicide.",4,she said she broke a promise.

i once did this to my sister and i only read one post she published in r/BPD about writing her own suicide notes and planning on committing suicide, but she was burning herself and being psychotic and about to commit suicide like I'm not in that place right now but it sure makes me feel worse that my family doesn't trust me.

"I don't know whats wrong with me and I don't know what to do. Ive been depressed my whole life, but its only somewhat recently I've realised its not a nornal thing. I've never really woken up happy to be alive. I either have bad days where I wonder why I bother for a while then get up cause it's ""what I gotta do"" and theres other days where I'm able to function ok. I get happy, but ive never been content about life.

Now Ive started getting crazy paranoia. I'm starting to convince myself that my friends who love me hate me and I can't stop it I know it's all not true but there's these sorta voices in my head that do everything they can to convince me it is and I'm starting to give in. I'm just full of hate and soite and jealousy now and i don't wanna feel like that but I cant help it. 

I fucking hate living like this. I'm so fucking alone and my self hatred runs so deep. Ive had periods where ive looked at myself in the mirror and just gotten so fickimg angry that that piece of shit exists and then i get a sorta feeling of clarity where i go to grab the knife or whatevers at hamd and i just whack it on myself. I don't even cut I'm just shout and whack it on my arm and it leaves deep cuts and then i just cry thinming why did i do that.

I don't wanna live like this I don't really wanna live at all I never hsve but i can't die cause I have family. I'm forced to keep going on in this shit. Everyone hates me and I see why. I'm just an insecurities riddled piece of shit and i trust no one not even the people I'm meant to because my head tells me not to. My dads schizophrenic and I'm noticing so many features he has in myself and I'm gonna end up him when I'm older. I'm so fucking alone.

If anyone tries to I push them away because I'm worried that maybe love won't save me and at that point I'd be conpletely hopeless. Id definitely end stuff then.

"The first time shit started to really hit the fan was 9th and 10th grade. My family had just moved and there was always something to bicker about. I was the only child and I didn't do fairly well in school and waking up early when my body for some odd reason decides to default to sleeping like a backwards human being didn't help either. It was the first time I had heard about all of my symptoms being that of someone with ""depression."" Mental illness is not a universally/well-spoken about topic where my parents came from so naturally came the ""How can you be so lazy, how can you get such bad grades when we're trying so hard to put a plate of food in front of you."" 

Things got worse when I dove into self-harm because at the very least it was some kind of relief. My family doctor found out accidentally while giving me a regular health check up. I was interviewed and I could feel my doctor's spite. The anger resonated with my mother and she reacted in anger saying: ""I don't know why she even does that!"" And came the car ride, ""If you hate your life so much why don't you just die."" 

And I almost believed that she meant that and I spent hours crying on the kitchen floor. My mother is the only person I can usually trust, I felt like what was even the point. 

Before we left the doctor's office I was threatened to go see someone and that there would be an issue if they found out I didn't schedule for one. My mom and I both sat in the car and she bargained with me explaining that if I were to go to a therapist, they'd mark my records as a mentally ill person and that I'd never find a job. 

After that I tried my best to cope with it. But then I broke one day. I was having an argument with my mother and it was the first time ever she had physically smacked me across the face. I was mortified and I broke down in my closet. It was the first time I had felt unable to control my own body. It was then my mother decided to give me a listen to the issues I was going through. 

After I calmed down, I explained to her what depression really was and how it feels and what I can and can't do sometimes. She sympathized with me but I didn't think about therapy after that. I told myself I'd eventually go. 

I'm a 3rd year into college now and it's over break. I'm not feeling the best, but better than I have since the past several months. I want to seek help while I can before I fall into another slump.

"I am 25yr male from India and am living in the US since last year with my parents.

They have always had domestic quarrels and sometimes violence since as far back as I can remember.

This had scarred me for life as I didn't have confidence to talk to any person, I never had a girlfriend nor did I pursue any marriage choices.

I did separate from them for a brief period while I left to train for IT at a different city after my Bachelors.
But then, our immigration case which was pending since more than a decade in backlog was processed and we all migrated to the US.


Here, the tides turned dramatically, at least for my life.

I moved here to study, but I was forced to drop out because my father won't spend any money to care for my ailing mother.

Furthermore, my relatives here abandoned us and even troubled us to the point where they destroyed years of relations and blood lines.

Additionally, I was forced to take job at a crappy place to bear the burden of my Narcissistic Father, my obsessive mother and my innocent young brother.

My Father is more than just frugal but a Miser.
Not caring for his family he buys properties in India while his family suffers here.
He would've killed my mother by not providing her with day to day food and sanitary products had I not abandoned my education and put my hard earned money to provide for her.
He constantly troubles, teases and incites quarrel.
He acts in mischief making my mother shout loud at him and disturb the neighbors.

My mother on the other hand is so obsessive that she sometimes won't even let me sleep alone and would herself sleep on the floor of the room.
She always would be pin pointing at me for trivial stuff.
Would not let me study nor work in solace.

Granted this is an over affection of motherly nature but coupled with my father's mischief is disasterous.

She can argue with him for DAYS (I'm not kidding) on end without even eating a morsel of food.

I can continue for pages but coming to the gist.

My father was doing the same mischief again and my mother called the police on him. Saying that he is abusing(she intended verbal, police assumed physical) the children and her and not letting us live peacefully.

This happened at the end of a shouting session between my parents which all happened in the apartment I leased on my crappy salary from the job I had to take after I had lost all hope in life and no relative or friend would help us.

The police had to write down my name as well as my parents and confirmed that as long as no one physically assaulted anyone they can't do anything.
But if they continue shouting and the police has to come again, they'll take one of my parents away.

Now, I am again scarred to life as I was when I was a kid, a teenager, a young adult and now again.

Country doesn't matter, relations don't matter, dreams and aspirations don't matter to my parents.

They are narcissistic and obsessive fools.

Despite being a University topper and despite being a top notch Computer Programmer, I couldn't fulfill my dream, I couldn't study for my Masters and I couldn't prepare myself and work for a good company.

They have now spoiler my life again and possibly for the last time.

Now I wish they would just leave me alone and be off on their ways.",4,"they continue shouting and the police has to come again, they'll take one of my parents away"
"Hi, I'm in my senior year in high school, and I need help with my girlfriend. While I currently do not have depression, she does. One thing that worries me the most is her pessimism. Sometimes, there will be a situation that she is not looking forward to (for example, she is getting her wisdom teeth out tomorrow), and she gets incredibly down and grumpy about the situation. I have told her that it will be ok and that I'm here for her, but she continues to rebut with ""I'm being logical and I'm correct that it will suck"". How do I help her? Obviously she is right and it will suck (I've gotten my wisdom teeth out so I'm definitely aware of the pain), but she still gets really depressed and pessimistic about everything. What do I say? I've already introduced the idea of therapy and she definitely did not like that, so as of now, I'm at a loss as to what to do. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

"I'm a twenty year old who still lives with his parents and is going to college. I had been thinking about things recently, namely about how bad my depression has gotten, and I decided I'm tired of feeling this way and I wanted to do something about it. I decided I needed a change, and wanted to finally move out. I went to my family and decided to tell them my plan to move out which they thought I definitely should not do that way I could finish college. While we were having the conversation I began to tear up and my stepmom (who is like a second mother to me) asked me why I was getting emotional about it. I didn't really know why I was but I decided that I couldn't really hide it anymore. I told my parents I was depressed and suicidal and they both began crying. This was a shock to me because I have always felt as if I was more of a drain on them than anything else. It was extra surprising because I had never seen my dad cry, over anything, and I truthfully thought my dad was ashamed to have me as a son. They began telling me how much they loved me, and my dad even told me that he was proud of the man I've become, and I found out that my stepmom struggles with depression as well, and has taken medication for it and says she feels a lot better because of it. We're going to plan a doctors appointment for me and see if medication can do something to help me, because I'm doing a really shitty job of managing it now. I just wanted to post this to really share the experience with you guys, because it has honestly changed my whole world. I had been going through life, day by day, feeling like I was a parasite, feeling unloved, feeling ashamed to be who I am, but now after talking to them I feel a lot better, I feel like I may be able to finally fight this. Please excuse any grammar or spelling errors, I'm writing this in tears, but if you're struggling with depression, and feel alone, and feel like medication isn't for you, maybe you should just open up to someone close to you about your depression. I can't say that your experience will be the same as mine, I don't know anyone else's situation, but what I can tell you is that opening up to them, and finally telling someone ""I am depressed"" made me feel a lot better.

She was the only one that cared about me, that didn't put me down. Even though I had many failings she still said she loved me, even after my best friend's put me down for being dumb. She was the only one that treated me as an equal and not a second rate citizen to be laughed at or to be disappointed with. 

I started uni this year. I've had fun but made close to no friends and it feels really superficial. I don't know if I like it but there's no way I can go back now, my parents will fucking disown me even if I try, even though I'm at a second rate uni wasting my time.

I tried getting help from my email by applying for councilling but they took a month to reply and when I turned up there was no one there. 

I am so lonely. I have no more will to continue. I can't end it but if I could I would. The weather makes me feel like shit. The success of all my friends compared to how much of a fucking FAILURE I am makes me feel like shit. I have no one to turn to. Most nights I can't even sleep and when I do only for a few hours at a time. I will do shit in my exams. I still go through life but I feel like an empty vessel. My parents are disappointed in me. My younger sister makes fun of me. People avoid me.

I try to be an interesting person and someone to invite to parties but it just seems whatever I do people reject me. I just want this to end. I want to be happy and live life.

I love too much and it's hurting me because they don't love me or care for me back. It's not romantic wise. It's just one of those genuine friendship types.

They distance themselves away from me because they know that's what's best for our relationship 

It's all my fault I ruined our friendship. I put too much care into them. I bought them a lot of things to show how much I care. But I messed up. I messed up big time. I was living in denial the whole time.

I found out they only still care about me because they're a good person. Not because I'm something. I was such an idiot. I was the asshole beachside I kept expecting something in return from them. 

And I can't stop caring about them. I want to isolate myself from them for good, because they don't deserve someone like me at all. All I did was hurt. 

I easily get jealous when they give care and attention to someone else.

My god, I'm just really sad and heartbroken at this point. Just a depressed teen here, crying hot tears in bed, and listening to chill hop. I am nothing but a horrible piece of shit.

Last year I had some of the darkest moments in my life. Iâve been reflecting over those moments the last few weeks and I have finally accepted the fact I need help. Iâve always thought I could do things on my own and I didnât need anyoneâs help. However last year showed me I can win battles on my own but Iâll never win the war without people supporting me. So I decided to try to let people into my life this year and let them help me when they offer it. Also I just want to try to be more social in general.  To start out I decided to make a Facebook account since people always seem to ask me that and I always say I donât have one. Ironically when I tried signing up it said my name wasnât real. Haha can you believe it oh god truly has a sense of humor. Anyway as soon as I got there I started seeing my friends accounts and their friends and even though I knew some these people for some reason I got the feeling I always get when Iâm around a lot of people. The feeling of not belonging. I hate this feeling and itâs probably because I spent so much time isolates from other people but I never seem to feel like I fit in even with friends. I look at the whole thing and itâs just not for me. Itâs like these people are happy they have lives they care about others. They put themselves out on the internet for everyone to see where as Iâm a more personal type of guy. They are normal human beings and at times I honestly question wether I even am human. Anyway itâs weird just wanted to put this out there. ,4,decided to try to let people into my life this year and let them help me when they offer it
