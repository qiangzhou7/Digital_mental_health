"So basically since last night I have been on the panic attack rollercoaster. Crying, freaking out, insomnia, and the feeling of staring into a black hole of hopeless nothingness.

Well I did my self-care and took an emergency xanax, I've been drinking chamomile and letting the crying come when it comes. I've talked to family and they know what's going on but like...

When I'm not actually crying I don't feel a god damn thing.
I feel dead and hopeless. Nothing feels good. I look at the future and think, what's the point?

I've been trying to do cheerup things, self-care things, and all they do is make me cry in frustration.

How can I feel alive again?

"My so-called 'passion' for music has driving me to near self mutilation. I'm starting to think that the 'passion' has worn off and gotten deep. I've been dealing with some deep seeded issues involving music, my self image and creative-side. The last few months of 2016, I've nearly stopped most recording and writing cause the anxiety of trying to present it online or in person overwhelms me. 

Looking towards the new year, I've decided to do things I wouldn't normally do, an open mic last night with a friend and I felt so out of place. And tonight I tried to record a vocal at home and just couldn't get my head into it. I almost sent my microphone through my computer screen. And the kicker, I had a conversation with an industry friend and he is like 'follow your passion', keep writing and recording and I keep texting. 

I doesn't make me feel good, why should I follow it if it makes me crazy. I have a great job and it's given me time to think on life and money and where I wanna end up and I feel that at 26 I've been force-fed this crap about following your passion and it will lead to happiness when all it's led to social anxiety, perfectionism, lack of trust, depression and envy. Why can't everyone just let everyone figure out everything in their own time, why is it the modern way to make everyone rush and feel guilty that we have nothing or not doing enough.

I'm mentally exhausted from trying to figure out the whole thing and I don't think it's worth it anymore. The best part is that I keep asking for help and nobody seems to have any ideas or wants to help. Maybe I'm naive about that. Too many bad things about it all.",3,"job led me to social anxiety, perfectionism, lack of trust, depression, mentally exhausted"
"Hi,

 I've been feeling incredibly tired and lethargic lately. I'm on three fucking anti-depressant (citalopram 40mg, wellbutrin 150mg and elavil 30mg) and can't even function normally. 

I've been procrastinating most of my christmas break and don't see how I'll be able to go back to work in this shape. 

I have absolutely no motivation, I sleep or nap or am zoning out all the time. I'm having bad thoughts sometimes and I'm scared of my own brain. I think I should see my dr. about that.

I'm at a new low point in my life and can't see shit turning around anytime soon.

I feel like staying in bed and just giving up on being happy. At least that way I can't get worst than I am.",3,"incredibly tired and lethargic lately, on 3 anti-depressants, citalopram, wellbutrin and elavil, no motivation, at new low point in life"
"College has been the worst experience for me. I started out at a community college and then transferred to a small city college in my town that I commute to. First of all, I hated both schools generally. I had always wanted to go off to college but couldn't afford it. Anyway, I have taken only a couple classes each semester because my depression started almost immediately when I first began school. Now it's two years later, I have nothing but general courses, I thought I'd try computer science and hated it...So I'm back where I started. And everyone I went to high school with are graduating now which makes me feel so much worse. I still don't even know what I want to major in. And I really don't want to stay here for two or three more years to finish a degree. Can anyone relate?",3,"hated both schools, only took a couple of classes as depression hit me, still dont know what I want to major in"
"Finally went to the doc after being in a nine month low, the lowest I've been in years. I started meds and my doc just upped them after my three week check up. She also gave me a pill to stop panic attacks. 

I thought I was making strides forward. Today my dad's girlfriend, a very nice and loving woman, died. She died the exact same way my mom died almost exactly six years later. 

I remained calm for him, but I'm having a terribly hard time. I'm just numb. I just don't fucking understand. Death just follows me. 

I don't know what to do. My boss told me to take tomorrow off. My dad lives 3 hours away and is snowed in so I can't really even go visit him. 
I'm drowning. ",3,"started medication, doctor gave medication to reduce panic attack, dad's girlfriend died, I'm drowning"
"I'm am minor and i called because i wanted to die kind of. I wanted to stop existing, just not wake up really. I got this very nice kind of unprofessional but really rally great women who explained that since i was a minored she had to inform my parents. I panicked she calmed me down for the entire phone conversation. She called my mothers work and left a voice message, it's 4am she'll get it in a couple hours. I don't want to face that i panicked. the second she hung up i went into the worst feeling ever. I started screaming at myself and crying my hands are still shaking, i thought i was dying. Fuck i don't want to live these next couple hours.",3,"I am a minor, went to therapy, she called parents to inform , I panicked, dont want to live"
"I pretty much spent the whole of last year quite depressed. I knew something was
up with me so recently I started taking anti depressants (non SSRI) and only now im actually starting to feel something, do I realise just how long I was numb for. 

It was hard to describe to my girlfriend that I wasnt upset or unhappy I was just unable to feel anything at all... I would have loved to have been able to be unhappy about something. To feel the intense emotions of unhappiness (like from a break up or something) would've been such a welcome change from the void I was in. 

I've definitely got a long way to go but the anti depressants I've been taking (mitarzapine) has shown me the first glimmer of hope I've had in a while.

"I'm jealous of all of my friends who are able to go outside and go to school like it's nothing. For me school just ends up making me feel bad, I get the worst test scores in my class (I got a 39 in Algebra). I even suck at the subjects I should be good at. No one in my family is doing anything to help me, I just want to drop out, but I can't because I want to make them happy. I don't even know what I'd work as if I dropped out, but I'm on that road anyway seeing as I haven't been going to school. Why is going to school so easy for people that aren't like me? It's so annoying to have no one to relate to and I have no one to ask for help. I'm just getting really tired of staying home and doing nothing. One of my friends who I was close with just talks about how good she's doing in school around me, telling me how she's to of her class and 20th in the school's top students. I just don't understand how school is just so easy for people.",3,"worst scores in my class, no one in family is helping, want to drop out, havent been going to school, tired of staying at home"
"Recently,I have developed a extremely annoying issue,I just can't get some words out of my mouth,not certain words,just random,I would be saying a sentence and suddenly one of the words just will not come out,or even worse,that ""Unspeakable word"" is the first word of my sentence,and I end up not even saying it,since I can't even start it.

This is almost directly related to my social anxiety and lack of self confidence,this has been making me more and more scared to talk every minute of the day,I am now training myself to take deep breaths and slow down my speech,and have the whole sentence I want to say displayed in my brain before I say it,but even if I do all 3,there is still a 50% chance that I would mass up and look like I am going to vomit,and I can't just take random deep breaths and sudden slow of speech in a presentation,right?

Please help,I am scared to shit now.",3,"cant get words out of mouth, social anxiety, maj=king me more scred to talk everyday, feel like vomit, random deep breaths"
