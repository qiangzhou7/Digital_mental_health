"So I actually got to a point to seek out online help. I found https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/ online and tried their 800 number and online contact. The fact that I was stuck at number 28 online and when I called the 800 number I was put in a queue somehow helped me. It was ridiculous that I sit here with a gun in hand, desperate and looking for a reason not to shoot myself. I was hoping for someone to talk to, but when I get stuck in a queue and start thinking more about what I'm doing, it did actually help me. So, once again I help myself. For this moment, I haven't actually pulled a trigger, but I still think about it every single day. I would like someone to talk about that to, but as it is, I'll take a brief internet vent. I choose to post rather than shoot....for today........",0,

"Since ""obviously"" we depressed people are just ""helpless souls"" who need to be ""saved"" by the ""normal people"". ""Obviously"" you get to delegitimize this entire space just because there aren't ""normal people"" here trying to ""save us from ourselves"" and ""enlighten us"" and ""teach us the true way to live"". They say ""just be happy"", GOLLY GEE you think I haven't fucking thought of that yet?

Sometimes depressed people don't want help. Of course, help is absolutely necessary sometimes, but quite frankly it's none of your business to come into our spaces and tell us how we have to act or what we have to say. If you have depression sometimes you need a place to just rant. 

It's nobody's obligation here to ""solve depression"". The point isn't to ""save"" depressed people. This is not the place for non-depressed people to try to ""save us"" and feel good about themselves in the process. This is a place where people who are trapped in suffering get to scream into their pillows and maybe have someone there who hears them and understands them and maybe even responds to them. This isn't a clinic and it doesn't need to be.

Again, there is a time and a place for depressed people to receive help, but it is neither here nor now.",0,

My boyfriend and his family and some friends sat around the dinner table on New Years Eve and we talked about our New Years resolutions. When it came around to me I declined saying that what I had to say was a bit depressing. I was encouraged to talk and choking on tears I simply said that I wanted to see New Years Eve 2017. None of us thought I'd even be here to see this one. Everyone went quiet and looked away. One of the friends put his hand on my shoulder and encouraged me saying he was proud. I was too emotional to say thank you but it meant so much to me.,0,

"So yeah, drinking whiskey to forget how shit you feel doesn't work, makes it even worst, your body goes down, and down, with your mind.

I was always able to put a limit to myself when doing it. But now I'm scared because I feel I could drink a whole bottle in a row. I just wanna end it. (I haven't had a drink in a while, because of this.)",0,
"Fascinating. I did the same, stoped using fb as one of the first steps of getting better. But still use instagram.
And I feel so much better without fb.

Then is fb something that we should allow in our society? ",0,

"If you're anything like me you like to see videos on youtube on depression and mental illness and stuff to get answers. A thing that gets mentioned a lot in these videos and by people around you is that ""everything will be fine"". However I think this is a wrong message. When you say ""everything will be fine"" it sounds like everything will automatically fall into place. But it's not going to automatically fall into place. Depression is a like a pit that always gets deeper and if you don't start climbing it will be harder and harder to climb out. You won't automatically get out of depression. You have to work for it, search for long term and short term goals that are possible for you (a therapist can help with this really well). Don't just wait for depression to end because it's just going to get worse. Latch on to the pit and start climbing, that is the only way.",0,

"I'm used to going in and out of depressive episodes. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was in my early teens. During some depressive episodes these thoughts are very frequent, more than 100 fantasies/day.
The thing I've realized is that these thoughts aren't just connected to my depressive episodes. Right now I'm not having an episode, but even a minor frustration makes me think about eventually killing myself.

"I've been mostly happy with my life the past couple of months, I might even say that I've been happiest than in years. But I still just don't care if I would die right now. I'm not feeling like doing anything to myself anymore, but I often find myself thinking how much easier it would be if I would just be dead. I don't really want to deal with everything that life's going to push through my throat because even if I'm happy now I know there will be a shit show later.

Can someone help me to get some perspective?",0,

I will play it on repeat until I fall asleep tonight. I get extremely sad at night (for no reason) so I pick a song and play it repeatedly.
