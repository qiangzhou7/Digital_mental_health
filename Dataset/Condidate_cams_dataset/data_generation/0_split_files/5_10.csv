Then I started getting acne and my face started growing and getting fucked.

"I think back to when I was a kid and everything was so colourful and vibrant and experiences were new and fresh. Everything felt so real and so exciting and the possibilities were endless with regards to our futures and our dreams. Nowadays I don't get a buzz, I don't get a sense of excitement from anything really, I don't get it. I don't feel depressed, I don't feel down but I do feel like I'm sort of floating through life without a purpose and it's not a nice feeling to have. 

I'm training to be a teacher and I love working with the kids because it gives me that sense of excitement and fun again and I can see them learning and embracing every experience with both hands but for me I don't have that and it worries me. I don't want to bumble about waiting for something to excite me, I want it now, but I don't know what IT is. I have interest and hobbies but nothing that makes me want to get up early in the morning and go for it.

I don't really know what I'm saying. I guess I need to change my habits and diet maybe to feel more energised and proactive but it's so easy to just curl up and forget the world whenever you get the chance. ",5,it's so easy to just curl up and forget the world whenever you get the chance
"Hei.
I'm trying to start loving myself and stop harming my body.
While I'm seeing a professional I would like to find someone who had similar experience maybe?

How to start loving yourself?
I have this huge problem where I hurt myself when someone hurts me emotionally to the point where I can't take it anymore.
I just find physical pain more bearable.
I used to cut and scratch myself.
Lately I started to burn myself with this acid pen (used to heal warts) - i just drip that acid on my skin and watch it burn my skin. then I concentrate on physical not emotional pain. 
I know I can't keep on going like this. 

besides working out, finding a hobby, reading books..
what else can I do to take my mind off of that?
is there something I could do while I'm at work?
I don't really have anyone to talk with about this.

Thank you, have a great day.",5,hurt myself when someone hurts me emotionally to the point where I can't take it anymore
"I have been depressed for 6 years now. I went to see a therapist and I told my parents and friends about it, around 5 years ago. A year after that, I just accepted my depression and I acted like everything was going great. My parents  and everyone else were relieved and I swore that I would never tell anyone about my burden anymore. But it feels good to admit it here.
I honestly believed that I deserved all those horrible feelings and lack of happiness, but I have a better self-esteem now and I want to feel better. I'm no longer thinking that I deserve this, no one does actually. I'm considering getting help again but I wonder if a therapist can trust me after faking getting better to another therapist? And should I tell the people around me how I faked getting better?",5,deserved all those horrible feelings and lack of happiness
"Hello, in need of some advise. I have a 2 year old greyhound who I have had for 1 year and I am thinking of giving him up. The reason for this is because of my lack of motivation due to my anxiety and depression. I never walk him because I canât seem to make myself go out the house, I stay at home all day and it seems the only time I ever clean my house is when I have something to look forward which is another story but anyway due to not walking my dog he wees in my house and even poos sometimes, he is wrecking my house! He chews my carpets, eats anything in sight and I just canât cope with him. I really do love him but he is ruining my life, I canât even take him anyway because he destroys other peopleâs houses too. I think because he is a working dog he needs lots of walks to release his energy and because I donât I think he is using that energy on ruining my house.

"So, Iâve come to conclusion that the worst part about depression is how easy it is to convince yourself things are fucking awful but itâs so so hard to tell yourself things are good. 

Everytime something good happens I can see a way to ruin it. Because I always ruin everything. My new girlfriend? Sheâs going to leave me because Iâm not good enough and never will be good enough to love anyone as beautiful as her the way she deserves. Maybe itâs kinder to let her go so she can find someone who really loves her and can properly show it. Not me. Not someone who sleeps all day forgets to text forgets to hang out canât even muster up the fuckin spine to tell her how I feel. 

No wonder she doesnât want to talk to me. No wonder she hates to spend time with me. Iâm a stain. Iâm nothing. To no one. Why bother? 

This is just some weird rambling. I donât know. I just want to isolate myself so I can stop hurting other people. And once Iâve succeeded at being completely alone then I wonât feel so guilty about putting up a front and I cut and purge and end it all I want. Fuck me.

"Today has been a really bad day. I spent all day on the phone. You see, Iâve been in an active foreclosure on my house for a while. Part of my mental illness is not dealing with things when they are really serious like that cause Iâm scared. So at the last second I sent all the paperwork in. 

They never got to it and they sold my home on dec23. Iâve been trying to see if thereâs anything I can do but since the sale date already happened Iâm pretty much done. I havenât received a letter telling us when to move out yet but I know itâs coming. 

So needless to say Iâve been very depressed and just for lack of a better term fragile. Iâm lost. Sad. I donât know what to do. Iâve failed my family. 

Now this morning I was in a very depressed mood and my SO just blew me off and said to get over it. Like itâs something I can just get over by snapping my fingers. 

I canât take it anymore. Iâm gonna make some pirogies and I think after that I may finally hang myself cause Iâm finallyso overwhelmed with depression and pain I donât think it will go away.

"Hello everyone, I'm new to reddit so I'm not quite sure how it works but I felt I needed a platform to discuss this so here goes. I'm 17 I live in Sheffield, England and for the past few months I have have been dealing with depression and it is tearing me apart LISA (love you if you get that reference). In all seriousness, I feel so disconnected from everyone around me and it scares me to death. My 'friends' are all busy with relationships or with their own friend groups which is a thing I've never been apart of, I've always just had friends who had friend groups so I would be in a weird position. I often have very self loathing style thoughts and have very little to no self esteem. I feel like my friends are using me in a sense that they only call me if they need help with college work or I'm the last option because the rest of their friends were busy. I can't do anything though because I don't want to risk losing the few friends I do have. They all come to me with the stories of the great nights out or the holidays they all have planned and when they ask what I was up to, which is rare, I just have to say ""nothing"" and it makes me so deflated. I haven't felt genuine happiness in months and that is due to the lonliness, I would get back out there and look for someone but I have no confidence in myself so I'm terrified to do so. I can't feel like I can talk to anyone about it because they shouldn't have to put up with it which makes writing it here a bit ironic but oh well. In summary I'm scared. I'm scared of what the future holds, what happened in the past and I'm scared of the present and I'm not expecting any sympathy or world class uplifting guidance I just needed a place to vent.

"These boards are riddled with self contempt and self loathing, which is naturally what you might expect on depression boards. Im not condemning anyone for expressing the pain they are dealing with, but why are there never posts or replies with constructive, helpful advice on how to move forward and make progress towards combatting this illness. The few that are posted are overlooked and ignored in favor of discussing symptoms. Someone posts on here that they often feel like killing themselves and they get a myriad of posts from people who just tell them they also feel that way. The poster feels support knowing there are other people out there just like them, but what use or aid is there in this overall? It is probably more harmful than helpful.

"I was diagnosed with depression about 5 years ago and got prescribed prozac by my doctor at the time.  About a month after taking it, I felt really self-loathing and just worse in general, instead of better.  It got to the point where I nearly made an attempt on my life and got taken to the emergency room where they confiscated the medication off me.

Some time went by and I decided to go back again, this time they referred me for therapy, but the waiting list went on for a year and I still heard nothing (I'm in UK where NHS have free services, I couldn't afford private counselling).

The last time I went was about 2 months ago where they offered me medication again.  I decided to tell them I wasn't very keen on the idea of taking anti-depressants due to what happened before, and I also mentioned that I waited a year for therapy but it never fell through, and they said something among the lines of ""we're not sure what to do then"".

Even if it is, I don't see what I have to do with it? Why can't I be associated with the thousands of Indian men that marched for the rapists to receive justice? Nope. Guess I can march for my country's women, get hosed by the police, but I'm still an evil Indian rapist. Great.

Now that's not something I've gotten more than twice IRL, and dozens of times online but I hardly care about the latter, but I still wanted to mention it.

Now the weird thing is that I don't even know if I have a sexuality. I sometimes imagine myself as asexual.

This is because:

1. I find breasts and women in general to be attractive

2. I am repulsed to sex and vagina (receiving oral sex or a handjob is the only thing I'm not repulsed by)

I wouldn't classify myself to be asexual, but possibly I might be?

It's not even with dating or girls, I don't have romantic feelings to people or anything. I'm sick and tired of having been born flawed and ugly like this, and feeling ugly.

I don't know why I even dislike being ugly, because it's not like I care about it possibly impacting my relationships or friendships or anything like that.

For a while, I seemed to forget about my physical appearance.

Is physical appearance just the elephant in the room?

Whenever people talk about physical appearance like this, and call themselves ugly, the number one point of advice they receive is ""you're not even ugly.""

What about the fact that, according to people I've asked IRL and the internet /r/amiugly and /b/ and even this subreddit, I am ugly?

What do I do then?

""Ugly"" is literally an insult for things. I'm supposed to deal with the fact that my presentation is a literal insult?

"So, hey. 

I'm coming to this sub because... I feel empty, again. 
I just took my antidepressant for the day, and I still feel like depression is creeping in. 

About two months ago, I stopped going to school. It was either that or, you know, a mistake. I had to breathe. Two years ago, I already took a break because of depression, and saw what I could be without it. It was awesome. And now.. I'm missing school again. I feel emptier and emptier, and dumber every day. A few months ago I was doing amazing things, considering becoming something i'd never even dreamed of. Now, I have all of the possibilities for a better future, and yet i'm sinking in the terrible depths of my stupid brain. 

I can't come back to a regular sleeping schedule ; I keep thinking wht I should do today, etc. But then, my brain stops me :

""Why bother ? Nothing is important. Your success, your creation, doesn't impact anyone. And even if it did, it would be but a speck on billions of people. You're just trying to fill your time until you grow old and ultimately be alone. ""

Jesus, even typing this is horrible. But I can't stop thinking this is terribly true. I keep realizing i'm not intelligent. That it was something adults told me when I was young, I just rolled with it until the truth hit like a wall. And yet, my most happiest times were when I felt dumber. That I ignored the reality. I don't want to feel even stupider.
