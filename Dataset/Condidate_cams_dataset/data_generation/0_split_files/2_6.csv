"When I was in high-school, I screwed up any and every opportunity to get into Ivy League by getting suspended.

I also just lost my scholarship to my current college because I didn't get the minimum GPA required this past semester. Though my dad is paying for my education, I don't want to burden him unnecessarily. So yes, it pains me that I lost the scholarship. And my first real girlfriend (of nearly a year) just left me in the middle of that semester. She's not coming back, either.

Guys, my resting bitch-face is turning into resting Slav-face. (No offense to genetically Slavic people...That was just the best analogy I could come up with.) That's how terrible I feel. Nothing has made me smile genuinely for more than a second--and the best ""smile"" that I've even had lately was just changing my current face into what would be my neutral expression if I were happy. Not even memes make me laugh like they should. Not even when someone else shows me one, it doesn't; and I'm not faking it because that would honestly require too much effort out of me.

I lack so much energy that it takes me thirty minutes to get out of bed. And no, I'm not on my phone or anything. I just lay there. I don't even think about anything while I lay, either; I quite literally lay in bed for thirty minutes and struggle to actually get up. And what's worse is that I don't wake up by my own volition. My dad comes in and wakes me up. Speaking of that...My own dad told me on Christmas Eve that I was ruining Christmas by being lazy and noncompliant with him. He yelled at me and told me that I was to ""change [my] attitude"" or leave the house. It's not an attitude. I don't know what to otherwise call it, though.

What's worse is that my dad hasn't let me outside of the house for the past three weeks since my break from college started. He told me ""You're going to be productive while you're on your break. The only way to succeed in college is by doing more than what's required of you."" So I've been reading my English book two months in advance and answering all the guided-reading questions that correspond to each passage from dawn until dusk. I've gotten barely any sunlight whatsoever--and this only because I have a window in my room. And I haven't gotten exercise at all.

Besides the lethargy that I've been feeling, my metabolism has went to absolute shit. I haven't eaten more than a meal-and-a-half each day...and I'm talking about ""normal-person""-sized meals: normal portions...and I'm bigger than a normal person. I weigh, like, 100 kilograms (226 lbs)...yet I've been eating like an anorexic person. In fact, I was sick earlier this vacation and vomited anything that went into my system. I literally couldn't even eat a sandwich for two straight days. And I've been sick with standard cold/flu symptoms for the past week or so.

Even my sleeping schedule is off. A normal, healthy person sleeps eight hours every day. I've tended to sleep much longer than that...and I still don't feel well-rested at all. No amount of earplugs to drown out external noise nor sleeping-masks to prevent sunlight from awakening me has actually led me to a good night's rest. I tried NyQuil, too...but that didn't give me rest. It just drained my energy and forced me to sleep. It didn't give me rest at all, though.

If I can't change this...this intense feeling of malaise, I'm not sure what I can do. I guess I'll just go to my J-term class and see if I can't pretend that it's all O.K. Maybe I'll suddenly feel better if I just can pretend...hopefully...

But the thing is that this sadness is beyond tears; beyond simple and vague melancholia. It is an emptiness; a void. Since my mother isn't really in the picture (and so only my father is really here), I guess I could say in German: ""Ich fÃ¼hle mich mutterseelenallein."" And I do feel deserted. But I know I deserved it. I deserve everything bad that's ever happened to me and that will ever happen to me, because I'm such a screw-up. Even my own existence is a mistake. I was adopted at birth from two people who had a one-night-stand and no intentions of ever getting married with each other. Okay, yeah, they loved me and wanted me to have life. Thanks to them.

And thanks to my adoptive mom and dad for having fed, clothed, and sheltered me...but my adoptive dad doesn't love me like he should. He wanted a child whom he could be proud of. When that didn't work for my older brother, he focused all of his yelling and threats on me...and I've been forced into subordination or else exile. He's made me into something that I'm not, and I'm not comfortable. But I don't even know what I am, because I've been forced so much to be something that I'm not. But this isn't about how my dad fails to acknowledge mental health issues; this is about how much of a terrible person I am--and I am very much such a person.

I won't go into the details, but the reason I got suspended back in high-school was because I made an ironic and edgy joke about killing myself. (Say what you will about me; any rebuke just furthers the point that I am the scum of the Earth.) No, I wasn't suicidal. I was just into extremely offensive humor at the time.

I also am a long-time user of pornography. I have seen unclad women since I was ten. Now Iâm eighteen and have the worst imaginable sexual kinks. Iâm so fucked-up that I have a thing for torture and pain. And at this point, there can be no argument that I might ever do anything BDSM as an act of love. At best, Iâd do it as an act of self-pleasure because I so lack love--although even if someone would want to do it with me, Iâm not sure Iâd even be able to. Iâve had rapid bursts of sexual urges followed by long (multi-day) periods of not having the slightest feeling of wanting to relieve myself since this break started. Iâm sure that any girl with enough sex-drive to even tolerate BDSM would want it several times a day. So I wouldnât even satisfy such a girl.

And, despite the above, I believe in God. I donât want to do anything outside of marriage, which further proves my fucked-upness. Besides the fact that, even from a secular point-of-view, Iâm fucked-up, I now am doubly so fucked-up from a Christian perspective. And all happiness is supposed to come from God. So I guess Iâm so fucked-up that not even God wants to make me happy or something. I guess He wants to emphasize how much of a misbegotten shit I am.

As someone of illegitimate birth--as someone who could have been slaughtered just as easily as adopted--I am against the notion of abortion. In all ways, I am against it; even in cases of rape. I believe in the forgiveness of others (and yet I wonder whether I, too, will be forgiven?) because I find abortion to be punishment against a child for the sins of its parents. Someone who could have become a very close friend to me has just blocked me on Facebook because of my stance. I guess, besides not being good enough for Ivy League nor for affordable college nor for kindness from my father nor for happiness from God, Iâm also not good enough even for friends. Literally everyone who likes me doesnât know me whatsoever. Anyone whom I ever hang out with starts to drift away from me after maybe two hang-out-sessions. And Iâm heavily introverted: I donât just âlook for new friendsâ like that--but besides that itâs socially uncomfortable for me to seek others in such a manner, itâs also futile. I am unloved and have almost zero confidence that I will ever be loved--especially not by myself.

The worst part of this all is that a hobby of mine is composing and playing music. At the absolute maximum, Iâve done that for perhaps three hours out of three weeks. (And I feel as though it would be the same even if my dad would let me do whatever I wanted.) If I werenât such a disappointment and a mistake, I would easily do it for six hours every day...but, alas, I am a mistake. So I havenât even been doing the things I like to do...

And at this point, after much reflection on how bad of a person I am, I'm not sure whether I'll be happy again. Iâm not asking for help, though. I just wanted to...You know what? I donât even know why I wrote this, nor why I bothered to. I donât care about support. Love doesnât exist in my life like it does in othersâ. I donât even care about getting it off my chest. I just felt like having my voice heard, perhaps.

"Since I finished high school like 4 years ago my sleep is seriously fucked up, I just can't fall asleep before 5-6am and then it's extremely difficult to wake up and get out of bed before 3-6 p.m. I am sleeping between 12-15 hours a day. Since summer I am on ADHD medication, Trintellix, and some sleeping aid plus I am trying to limit my caffeine input. The medication helped but not a lot. Some days when I have mandatory classes or lab work at college, early in the morning, I skip sleep completely, being a walking zombie the whole day and then I sleep the next night. When I sleep for 8 hours I just feel tired, if I don't have something obligatory to do I cant get out of bed, I tried a lot of things multiple alarm clocks, have my mom call me nothing, etc. I just want to sleep for 8 hours like a normal person and feel refreshed. Cannabis isn't an option, it illegal and extremely difficult to get a prescription. I started eating healthier and I lost a lot of weight. I am considering to join a gym but i know I am not going to wake up and work out in the morning.",2,"finished high school like 4 years ago my sleep is seriously fucked up,"
"And judging by my user name, I'm sure you can guess what I'm talking about. I just set up this account, kind of a throwaway, sorta, but lord knows that since I have so much more time on my hands, might be using it more often.

It feels like wants to give me nice things, a job, a car, a nice girlfriend, and then subsequently take them away from me: Fights with my girlfriend, a fucking car accident, getting fired, and all of this only 6 months after my mom died right before my graduation ceremony from high school?

I know I fucked up at my job, it was completely my fault, I can't fucking wake up on time, even when I have ~50 alarms set. I'm fucking useless, that's literally all it is. I'm fucking done. I just want to die. My username is basically the motto I use every fucking night when I'm drenched in tears, begging a god I don't believe in to just take the last thing I have left (my life) because I don't fucking want it anymore, it's shit, I obviously don't know how to do ""life"" anyway, so it might as well just fucking end.

"I made posts about me not wanting to go to school, but I grew lady balls and put on my happy mask and went. 

just a side note that during the break I decided I was tired of feeling the way Iâve been feeling the whole school year and to deal with my insecurities. I have a big fear of being alone and i tend to depend my happiness on people. So to start I cut toxic people off and limited my phone use. I got off my other friends backs and continued to develop a friendship thatâs been blooming. I already start to feel better about myself.

So I quit a sport and I lost friends. I was so upset because I was alone again and started to resent other people that seemingly had a better life. But I realized I shouldnât beg people to stay in my life and if they want to leave they can. Plus everybody isnât perfect, and the comparing yourself to others just makes you more unhappy with yourself. People come in and out of your life as well, because everyone has their own life to live ya know? 

But anyway I got switched to new class today and it turned out I know everyone that sits at my table from past school years. I was so happy to be presented with the opportunity to make new friendships. Lunch kind of sucked bc I cut one girl off and she didnât sit with me but I discovered another developing friendship switched classes and had the same lunch. Lucky me! 

In the morning I used to freak out because I had no place or group to sit with due to the sport being early in the morning. So I decided to deal with it and sat by myself in the library until 1st period started. It helped me realize that my social anxiety is just me and nobody really gives af if you are by yourself minding your business. Same with other class periods where I donât have close enough friends. 

On top of this, I got my work schedule and Iâm working a lot this week so I can stay busy. Itâs like my life is getting back together and Iâm trying to stay as positive as possible. I just wanted people to see especially if youâre in high school that school isnât the devil you see it to be. 

Iâm thankful for this sub and for the redditors that have given me advice. I realize that everyone has ups and downs, nobody is perfect and everyone has insecurities. Even when everything is at its worst thereâs always something good in your life, even if itâs that you woke up today :) ",2,got switched to new class today and it turned out I know everyone that sits at my table from past school years.

"This is my first post to a subreddit so forgive me if I fuck something up. I am going to keep personal info vauge incase someone I know ends up here. So here it goes. From a young age I always knew I had things worse when compared to others around me whether it be financial situation or relationships but in the past couple of years I really found how different I was. My dad was abusive to my mother, they split when I was 2 however I do know my father but he isn't a father in the traditional sense. I randomly see him every few years and I am like ""Oh hi dad"" then he is like ""hi son"" and boom, that's it fast forward 4 years and rinse and repeat. I was never really fond of any of my family, I despise one of my siblings  because he is a fucking scumbag and really dislike my mother because of her stupidity and ignorance and shitty attitude toward me. I have a meh relationship with the rest of my family. When I younger I was really interested in video games, I never had any friends, not a single one, due to lack of similar interests and the location of where I live. Fast forward years later and my situation has only changed negatively, from the years of being locked away in my room, I have developed extreme social anxiety (not officially diagnosed but I know the symptoms when I see them) and have only fallen into a deep state of sadness, dunno if it is depression. My social anxiety is horrible, I shit myself when needing to get a haircut or go to a store. My school is bad too, I talk to people but they are not my friends, I pretend they are so I don't look like a complete fucking loner. I have never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl either and I am not even a bad looking guy.  My only actual friend is someone I met on a game 4 years ago. We talk everyday. Which is even more sad. I am beyond petrified of turning 18, because once I do, my mother will make me get a job, or I will live on the streets. I am scared to get a buy something in a store, how the fuck am I getting a job. Just the pass summer, I didn't leave my house once, there was no reason to, I have no friends to go out to. I stayed in my house for 3 months and never left once. My current situation is I stay in my room wasting away with every passing day. And I only become more and more sad as the days go by. About a year ago I have finally come to terms with the fact that I am going to end my life before I turn 18. I feel no reason to live on, I will not fair well in adult hood anyway. I know a lot of people are just going to pass this off as another bullshit post where the author dosent actually die and lives on happily ever after, this isn't that story. I will be dead within a year, period. Nothing will change my decision to end my life. I plan to hang myself with a belt that will be wedged between my door. I will not leave a note, I wouldn't give my mother the pleasure of reassurance to why I did it,  she dosent deserve it. These aren't my only reasons why I want to die. One small one would be the fact that baldness is big in my family history, so even if I get my stuff figured out, I still have balding to look forward to. A big reason as to why I am going to end my life is the curiosity of an after life, I am not religious so I don't beileve in anything specific, but god damn I am jelous of the dead, they know what comes next. Worst case scenario, its nothingness which still sounds better than my life.

I might as well just end it. I certainly talk enough about it. Doesn't make death any less scary, but death being scary isn't exactly reason enough to stay alive either. I have no confidence for the future or any reason to be. All I can really forsee is greater hardships down the road. Rationally, the only things that could really change in my life are bad things, and that really shows how much farther I have to fall. Sometimes I wonder how my brothers are doing. They haven't had to face the real world yet but they definetely won't be able to without help. I wish I could help but I can't even help myself.

"Iâve noticed lately that my energy level is very very low. It usually was but now its insanely low. And..I know why.

"I'm only 18, but I already feel like my glory days have come and gone. Back I highschool, I was pretty much the ""King of The Nerds"", as it were.

"EDIT: I should clarify that I only draw keys. I'm not doing inbetweens. I can't animate for shit alone.

I'm a 20-something artist who just started an underpaid job at an animation company. It's only been 3 months and I already feel like a talentless hack. I don't even know how I managed to get this job. I don't even have a solid showreel and I don't have the time to build one. I honestly feel like shit about it. I cannot even enjoy making art at home anymore. I need help.

4 years of college was a waste. My college was shit, they didn't teach much for the amount of money my parents helped pay and sometimes I regret not quitting sooner but it's because of that place that I found the person I really like and look up to. They're a great animator and I wish to follow their path if I could. They don't know it but they're a great inspiration.

I've been crying for days and I can't focus on my work. I wish I could just quit but that's not a really good option for personal reasons.

I wish. Someone out there could teach me animation, 3D especially. I'm so desperate. I don't have the money to pay for online schools and I've had no luck finding good tutorials for everything I need to know to really get into this industry.

Right now I'm doing 2D animation but I want to move to 3D after this job. I know how to use the basics of Maya so that's not a problem. But I feel stuck. Paralyzed. I'm scared I can't make it alone. I don't even know if it's possible to transition just like that.

This post is going all over the place right now but I really needed to let it out and get help if I could. And no, I don't see a doctor to see if I have mental health problems or not. I don't talk to my parents about this either because they are conservative and religious (Not telling what religion) and let's just say I'm not ready to tell them I might have mental health issues.

"Hello :)

I want to make this short. I was never diagnosed with depression, though my mum, ex-girlfriend and best friend who lived with me told me, that they assumed I was depressed. Whether thats true or not, I think I really need help with my life.

I gotta feeling that I don't do anything good with my life. I am just wasting time on the internet to distract myself.

I just want to know how to start to take action. I think I know excactly what I should do to become happy and to fix my life. I collected information, made daily tasks (which are totally possible to fulfill) and want to improve many aspects of my life, though i become overwhelmed. I don't even manage to stick to my healthy eating plan. So I end up doing nothing or just a few things and waste most of my time. I need to change something drastically.

So my question is: is there any trick to start taking action? Any form of mind trick? How can I motivate myself? I just need to go through some days to see the improvement and then hopefully it gets easier, but I need a start...and at the moment I feel like I am stuck in this pot of laziness, vegetating.

What helped you? How did you manage to achieve this initial burst of action?

Thank you so much! Every response will help me tremendously!",2,just wasting time on the internet to distract myself

Hello,

I'm sorry I don't speak *my language* well, so i'm writing this in English. My name is --------- ------, but you can just call me ----. I'm 18 years old and I am ---- ------, I was born and raised here in -------. I'm just a student at an international school really. Things aren't working well, they've never worked well. For years and years of my life I've lived with thoughts of falling to my death, drowning in my own blood. Years and years of depression that was neglected. And now it has come to the point where I no longer am stable, I can't bear it. I am in so much pain. I hear voices sometimes, they tell me to kill myself and they laugh at me. The depression became so much more worse, with constant thoughts of dying, my meaning of life being nothing, everything equaling up to nothing. I have lived with an abusive father my own life and my mother, grandparents, sisters, relatives, and even myself have acted like nothing has happened for so many years. It was years of being traumatized that I didn't realize had affected me so bad. This morning, I didn't want to join him for an appointment as it would be expensive for both of us and he should only do his checkup for now. I had talked to my father in a calm voice, using ""please"" and ""I would really not like to"". He then proceeds to shout at the top of his lungs as if he were a lion, it is quite a shocking and traumatizing roar. Then he proceeds to punch me until I fall to the floor and he kicks me and punches me while I am in a fetal position. He then got a big jug of water to dump on my face which I was choking on because I was already screaming for help and choking on my words before that. I lay on the floor crying and screaming and begging anyone to help me. I live on the 18th floor of my condo so no one could. I tried to though. He physically abuses me often, and after it he cries and begs me for forgiveness. I cannot take it anymore. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my younger sister whom I love so dearly. I think I've lost my sanity at this point, I have no hesitation to harm myself and I leave the house at 3am and go for long walks and come at 7 or 8 am. That I've stopped just for my mother because it frightens her. She as well who keeps accusing me of being a whore because I go out on my own all the time and where clothing that shows off cleavage and also have a curvy figure.(I have large breasts so it's hard to find a shirt that isn't a turtleneck to hide anything decently) Those walks were the only source of happiness I had because the feeling of walking away from my home was magical, and now I don't recognize the feeling of happiness. (It's quite ironic since my name means Happiness in Hindi) Please help me. Or at least give me some answers, some information. Please let me talk to someone from your association. I am begging you, I need this help. I need to tell you more. I have some money with me, I can give it. You can do tests on me even, please just talk to me. I have a high IQ, and am about to major in psychiatry myself. Please contact me here or my number is **********. 

Regards,
**** ******

I know I was coming off desperate at the end but I am. I'm severely depressed but I don't want to be! I don't want to be like this anymore. It's been too many years of this abuse and I cannot bear it with how bad the depression has deteriorated my brain. If anyone wants to talk about this more, please feel free to dm me. I am on another account then my main one cause I don't want anyone recognizing me or friends knowing I posted this.

"I just want to start this off by saying that I've never felt better than I do now. In the past few years I've dropped out of high school, managed to find an alternative way to graduate, and then pass a semester of college to drop out of the next one. I've struggled with finding the purpose of everything my entire life and therefore never put any effort into anything I've done.

I've been on and off three depression medications in the past and now I just recently started my third. I truly can't tell a difference when I'm on or off the medication. I don't know if I have depression or just a lack of motivation to do anything. I don't know what's wrong with me, or if there's even a depression medication that can help me.

My psychiatrist visits last about 5-10 minutes with her prescribing me a medication and sending me on my way. My parents really dislike her because of her medication strategy, but she's the only one in my area for 300 miles. With all that being said, She prescribed me dextroamphetamine 3 months ago alongside my depression medication and I was able to close out this college semester with a 4.0, I've been able to wake up for work everyday at 4 AM and work anywhere from 8-12 hours a day for the past 2 weeks while on break and I'm taking care of myself better than I ever have before.

I feel so good, but I'm worried. I'm losing track of the pills of dextroamphetamine I'm using a day. I have to down 5 pills of melatonin a night to get sleep, I have to down 4 pills of ibuprofen every morning because I've been working my body so hard. I down 6 pills of dextroamphetamine throughout the day to keep my energy up and enjoy being at work. I'm going to become addicted, I'm going to build up too much tolerance, I won't be like this for very much longer and I'm worried. I wish I could feel energized all the time, why do I have to use medication to function. I wish I wasn't so lonely that I have to open up to reddit because I have nobody else. Why can't I be normal. Why did I even bother typing this. Why am I looking for acceptance right now. I don't even know how many pills I'm downing in a day just to accomplish a regular work day that everyone else can do normally. The answer is that it's too much.",2,"dropped out of high school, managed to find an alternative way to graduate, and then pass a semester of college to drop out of the next one,struggled with finding the purpose of everything my entire life, put any effort into anything I've done"
"Back in October I lost my job. I was a temp at a college and my boss didnât know there was a limit on the length of a temp contract. The thing is, she had been doing kind of shitty things and when I finally held firm on my personal boundaries- boom. Come to work, worked for 2 hours, told to pack up. I kept my cool, but when I asked if I could use my boss as a reference she said âwe can talk about that later.â Iâve been seeing a therapist since the day I stood up for myself, just before they let me go though. The therapist is great and I understand that my old boss was manipulative, unfair, and just a shitty person. Still, as the sole breadwinner for my husband and kids I felt like I had been punched in the gut and the feeling hasnât really gone away yet. 

My husband is going back to school and also takes care of our 2 girls ages 2.5 and 5 years. He is getting better at being supportive but is pretty much the most unemotional person Iâve ever met. He doesnât understand that my depression is not a choice. Why on earth would anyone want to feel this way? My psychiatrist and therapist keep emphasizing that I practice self care and give myself space but whenever I ask if I can just be alone for a bit, or go out with friends, my husband acts resentful. 

In late November I started a new temporary position whoch should go through March, and all I do is go to work, come home to a crazy house (we also live with my loud, dumb, &amp; chatty af mother-in-law) and then go to bed when the kids finally concede. I feel fine at work, almost good sometimes, but as soon as I come home I feel totally overwhelmed. I have few escapes and I find myself wishing I could disappear from the world and that my family would magically forget me so that they wouldnât be hurt and I wouldnât scar my kids for life. 

Tonight I brought up taking a class I really want to take two nights a week, which would mean I wouldnât get home until after the kids are asleep, and one of those nights my MIL or my parents would need to watch the girls for a few hours. My husbandâs reaction was basically through gritted teeth âit would make a lot of things unnecessarily hard, but if you feel like itâs what you need to do...â

So the words were ok, but the way they were said changed the message entirely. Like I said, he doesnât have/process emotions well so Iâm trying to tell myself that he just isnât aware that his resentment seeps into things all the time and ruins them. Straightforward- âI think itâs too much,â compromising- â how can we work around the schedule conflict?â Or ACTUAL support- âI know you need to something for yourself.â Would all be fine, but saying something vaguely supportive with a hostile attitude feels manipulative. I keep wishing I could just go to my momâs house for the first time in my adult life because there even though my parents are weird they also can just be straightforward or supportive without emotional strings.

So tonight I went into my space-out mode after the class conversation, which then turned to silent sobbing. Couldnât read to my kids because I was crying and they couldnât understand me, couldnât do anything. Husband just sat around with me and the kids, never asked if I needed something, or wanted to be alone for a bit. No acknowledgement whatsoever about the fact that for over an hour I sobbed while it upset my kids. The lack of response is almost worse than the conflicted responses, but both leave me feeling utterly alone and wanting to die. There. I fucking said it.

So here I am. On Reddit. I canât imagine anyone actually reading this, and the truth is what difference would it make? If you are reading this, thank you. I hope that you are coping with your challenges better than I am, and that you have someone who can support you in the ways you need. 

Hereâs to a new year.",2,Back in October I lost my job. I was a temp at a college and my boss didnât know there was a limit on the length of a temp contract

"For years I had been telling myself that I would never be smart enough to get a scholarship, I would never go to university, I believed I would never succeed academically. 

Today I got a letter from the university I applied to, they not only accepted my application but offered me a $12,000 scholarship. I should be happy, more then that, ecstatic. This is the goal I have been trying to accomplish for years, the goal I never believed I would accomplish.

Now that I've finally done it I do not feel any less empty. I do not hate myself less. I still feel hatred towards myself and old doubts have been replaced with new ones. I do not get how I can go on if this is all that is going to happen. If I keep achieving things and I still have so many doubts that weigh me down or ones that leave me empty then what is the purpose of going on if you are always going to fail in some way. 

I used to also think that if I ever met anyone special that I would develop some confidence, but  if I didn't get any after this goal then how will a romantic relationship help me?

I'm scared that I will not find a meaning in my life, that I will never find worth in myself as a human being. Part of me really wants to just quit. Just stop it all so the feelings go away.

3 months ago I was in college, one of the best in my area, I have all the education I need to work in TV and I got a job there, sounds good right? Well 2 weeks In thoughts started occurring  to me, what if I get fired? What if I fail my classes? What if I loose my friends? Now I want to make it clear, I've had  depression and anxiety  for about 4 years and it hasn't gotten any easier hell it's the reason my last realtonship  ended in flames. Anyway so I tried not to succumb to the pressure  and bad thoughts that comes with anxiety  and depression so I started to try as hard as I could and even still I started to fail my classes so I thought well fuck how am I supposed to deal with this and the same day someone I thought I could count on decided she didn't want to be friends anymore so instead of coming and talking  to me like an adult she decided to call the cops and wrongfully  accuse  me  of stalking and tried to have me arrested long story short I ended up having to spend a night in holding. So I lost a friend and to make a long story short my whole world is crumbling right in front of me, I left school, I don't have a job and I think one of my best friends I think doesn't want to be friends  anymore and you know what I don't blame her, and just for now we will call her, M and truth be told I've kinda developed feelings for,  M as much as I like to deny that it's the truth, this might not even be in the same category but I'm also an extremely violent person I got it under control in the past few years but that doesn't stop the thoughts hurting someone else as a kid once I stabbed  another kid in the arm with scissors, even my other friends, I'll name them A, and J,  I think of hurting, I honestly  don't know what to do. I almost killed myself I had the knife pressed up against  my stomach and if the RA didn't come in I probably  would have done  it, and honestly  I'm thinking about doing it again.

"I **need** this year to be better.

I'm nearing the end of my third year of college. The new semester is approaching quickly, and I desperately need a good one in order to save me from failing.

I failed two courses last semester. I was miserably depressed the whole time and it showed on my GPA. That was my free pass; I can't afford to fail any more. If I do, I won't graduate on time. If I don't graduate on time, I don't graduate at all because they'll cut $8000 of financial aid and I can't magically come up with that money myself.

But this year doesn't have to be like that. I don't believe all of the bullshit about how the new year promises change and hope. It's literally just another day, except the year is different. Still, I'm mildly optimistic. 

I've never been a hard worker, but that has to change now. I know exactly what I have to do to be a successful student; doing it is just impossible sometimes. 

My depression is like a roller coaster. Before Christmas I felt amazing, and now I feel empty and broken inside. That worries me: if it comes back in full force in the middle of the semester, that could cause a great deal of damage.

Regardless, I wish you all a great new year. Hopefully this one won't be quite as shitty.",2,"I failed two courses last semester, if I dont graduate they will cut financial assistance"

"About two months ago I started working my first retail job at a grocery store chain, and everything was fine until they decided to move me to a different department that I can't stand being in, as well as changing my hours completely. Most people say that the front end isn't that bad, but it is for me. They won't let me move somewhere else, so I decided I wasn't going to deal with it, and ghosted instead of giving a two week notice like you should do.

I've been lying this entire week about going to work, and instead I've been reading books on mental illness at my public library and staying there until my ""shift"" is over.

 Earlier in life I was an idiot and didn't get any useful degree (even though I had an opportunity at the time) and got a stupid manager education instead just because it was easier. After that never worked as a manager cause I don't like people so of course I hated the job. Was working some random jobs which I hated aswell. 

 One day I decided to quit, move to the big city and get a decent degree in something. Figured I like computers so I'm gonna go ahead and be a computer guy. Got into the university for evening classes but couldn't even finish the first semester cause I was unable to find a decent day job to pay for this education so I got really sad and couldn't focus on the classes, plus I realized that this profession is way too hard for me.

  Years ago got alienated from a few friends I had cause coulnd't stand being a looser in front of them. Never had a proper sexual relationships cause on top of everything I'm a premature ejaculator so I guess it psychologically distanced me from getting intimate with girls. Got a decent body and in a good shape but to maintain it I have to work out regularly and eat crazy amounts of food in order to not become a scrawny ass motherfucker I was in high school.

Roughly a week and a half ago, I broke my ankle while out taking pictures at a local nature preserve. I tripped over a low-cut tree stump that was hidden under the falling fresh white snow. I was rushed to the hospital ER and operated on the following day where the put 2 plates and some pins in my ankle. A few days after that, I was sent to a local old-age home in my hometown to finish my rehab. I've been stuck here doing rehab ever since. My first appt. with the foot dr isnt for a week and then I'll know how everything is going.

I feel very frustrated being in this place and it drives me insane. Luckily I have a private room (it's semi-private but nobody is in the room with me) and they allow me to keep my door shut all the time. I have trouble with sleeping and they give me NYQUIL at night to help calm me down. 

Personally I would like to leave tonight but I have a ""non weight-bearing"" status on my foot and can't do anything at home yet. I'm learning to hop around on one foot and use a walker and everything but it is taking a lot of time. I'm very impatient sitting in this home though and wish I could do something (or my dad would do something) to get me to come home however since he's 80, he wants me to stay in here for a while to get better as well.

I constantly feel as though my life is worthless and this tragedy is just the latest in a long long line. I'm not sure how I can get my life back on track and I've talked to a counselor before for several sessions but really haven't come up with much in terms of solutions.

"Yeah, so...2017 has begun and i'm sure this depression will still kill me little by little in the inside. Will be 4 years since life became a total shit, when everything changed so bad...the same place, the same motherfucking job, no gf, not enough cash, the worst thing which is i left my studies, oh, and the same bullshit everyone tells me:
Everything will be fine, it's just a bad day, at least you have good health (i wish...), you seems like you have everything in life (ugh...).
Well, that's all i have to say, i just wanted to share my thoughs on this place, sorry if I offend to anyone...",2,"same place, same motherfucking job, no gf, not enough cash, kills me little by little"
"As I go into 2017, I feel nothing but sadness. I go explore Snapchat to see my friends that have started to drift away with their lovers, family, or a mixture of both his and her families. They're all laughing and having an amazing time together while I just sit here in my room.....alone.


This year has been nothing but negativity for me, not just because of all the negativity the media has been flaunting around in our faces about the horrible celebrity deaths, but because of my three deaths in my family. All of which I was extremely close to.

I feel like an outcast at my job and pretty much anywhere else I go but I act as normal as you could define anyone as ""normal"" would act. I try to treat anyone I come across with nothing but kindness and hate to see someone get mistreated.

But seriously, to continue with my sloppily organized post about how this negativity is ruining my life, I don't have my life even 1% figured out. I'm 21 which is a young age to have anything at all figured out but as I look around all I see are my friends getting engaged or getting these big job offers that they've always dreamed of. Some of them are also getting excepted into their dream schools to do what they've always dreamed of. One of my used to be closest friends got accepted into a school in Atlanta that will score him a place in TNA which will therefore most likely lead him into WWE. Yeah yeah it's fake and blah blah blah but it's what he wants to do and I've been supportive of him. I work at Lowe's, it's a very loving job and I love the people I work with most of the time, I don't feel like it's enough though. I don't feel like I living up to what I can be, but I don't know what I can/should be doing. Not a damn clue.

I've spent most of my last 6 months alone ever since my aunt died. I'm just very unsocial and it's extremely difficult for me to make new friends. I'm also not one to go and party (alcohol, weed, etc) because it's just not me. Everyone around me is that way and they're even getting into harder drugs. Yes this is the people I work with. My past relationships have both ended because of them cheating on me. I just don't really know what's wrong with me or if I push people away from me for a reason?

What I'm trying to say is that as I look at my friends having a blast on new years eve/day with their families, I sit here with tears in my eyes because I feel like I have no one. I feel very unloved and very unwanted. I just feel like that 2017 is going to be a long year spent as a loner because I just don't appeal to anyone and I don't have anyone to go out and do anything with to meet more people. I don't finwant to invite myself into peoples' plans and I don't want to invite them to do anything because rejection is pretty common for me. I trapped in a very dark place and finding the light seems impossible for me. Someone please help me. I haven't felt happy in a very long time.",2,"feel like an outcast at my job, finding light seems impossible, havent felt happy for a long time, trapped in dark,cant see light"
"I'm just a complete mess, and when she wants to go out and spend time with people, I enjoy that to a point, but then it becomes immensely stressful. And I've gone through a really difficult time, Christmas, New Years and 3 birthdays are in the space of a week. I've finished my uni and gone through a car accident in the past 2 weeks. I haven't been earning income from welfare since November so I'm really quite poor.

And I just don't have any way to vent and last night, when new years plans went to hell and my license disappeared, I snapped. I broke as a person. And I tried to be okay and I couldn't be.

I'm just an awful person and I'm trying to get better and I can't be and that's so beyond painful I can't describe it.",2,haven't been earning income
"I can't really remember exactly the last time I didn't want to kill myself. The feeling has always been there but I didn't really acknowledge it until about early high school. I can say with pretty good confidence that I've wanted to kill myself everyday since then. 

Reading many posts about what people have been through and their current awful situations just makes me feel more guilty for being suicidal even though I have a caring family and am decently well off. 

My birthday is on new years. I was born just past midnight, so my family and I usually celebrate it on New Year's Eve. However, the last few birthdays I haven't been happy. I always work for my parent's business because we're constantly understaffed. I don't have freedom. I just work. On top of that, I have to deal with the constant desire to just die while having to work. Every year, I'm scared of what the new year will bring, and I resent my parents just a little more for letting me become the happy little accident that I am now. Couldn't they just use a condom? 

2016 has been one giant clown fiesta for me. I'm fully confident that 2017 will be just as bad. I want to make it all end now but I'm too scared of the pain and the nothingness that will consume me once I'm gone. I'm not religious so I don't believe in an after life. Often times I wish I were, that way I'd be more inclined to just get the ""pain"" part over with and to just kill myself already. 

There's no real order to what I'm saying. I'm just venting I guess. I wish I would just kill myself, instead.",2," work for parents business, always understaffed, , no freedom"
"I called out of work today, and no I wasn't hung over from a night of partying. I was working until 11 last night. In the last two days I worked 30 hours, and in the next two days I'm working 21. I've been extremely depressed lately to the point where I found myself seriously considering suicide. I've been in a really bad place and haven't had the time to process any of what I've been dealing with.

But I still feel really guilty and like I'm a bad employee. I'm really scared of my boss or coworkers hating me. I've never taken a day off before, and I feel like I really do need it. Plus, there are some people at my work who call out pretty often and nobody seems to care. So why am I so stressed and scared about this? Am I wrong to call out?",2," Called out of work ,been in a really bad place, feel like bad employee, scared of boss or coworkers hating"
"my grades are so bad. i am the only one who failed out of the grade in my class and now im all alone in a new class full of failures like me and i really dont know what to do. it feels like all my friends from my previous class are just subtly looking down on me, and i hate it. Fuck the education system and fuck myself for not being able to pass.",2,"only one who failed out of grade in class, all alone in a new class, friends from previous class subtly looking down"
