"Hey guys, this is my first post in a long time back on reddit because I quit for awhile to try and sort myself out.

Well life has hit me really hard again lately, so here I am.

Iâm just wondering if any of you can relate to never being excited as a kid? Or like things that were supposed to excite you made you anxious/embarrassed? 

For instance, I hated going on vacations with my family. I did not find them fun at all. I hated going to amusement parks and field trips because everyone around me would be having so much fun and I just couldnât. I rarely got excited on any holiday except a little bit on Christmas because it was the only time of year when everything around me seemed to calm down and people seemed to be genuinely nice to each other. I never thought my birthday was a big deal and never wanted parties, even though I had a good amount of friends. I just feel like this isnât normal for a kid and maybe I am actually clinically depressed, BUT I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A DIAGNOSIS. ",4,"ated going on vacations with my family.

"6 months ago, my girlfriend of 2 years ended our relationship by cheating on, followed by moving out with all of our stuff (gave away my bed and furniture so she could move hers in), and a bunch of other really low stuff, saying she never even loved me and was leading me on. It's been 6 months but feels like it be end a week, literally. I get little memories of us talking about something that actually feels like it was last week, they feel so clear. I've never been depressed, never been in a relationship. After she broke up with me, I realized how pointless my life now is. I was working 10 hours days 6 days a week so I could support us. I was working for us, we were talking about getting married. It was a bit early but we were set on having kids. The thought of having a kid and family to take care of motivated me so much. And now that I don't have that I feel so pointless. It caused a lot of philosophical questioning in my head about life, and I don't even wanna be alive at most times. Some days I feel so positive, some days I think about jumping off of a bridge. It's been 6 lonely months, without a job, now living at my dad's while he's constantly pestering me about getting a job. I've posted on here so many times and people keep telling me just to move on and hangout with friends but it's not that fuckin easy. I have 0 motivation to do anything and I feel so pathetic. You would think that if I'm gonna be alive I should at least do something with my life even if I wanna die, but I don't. I just sit here and listen to music all day. I have dreams but they feel so impossible that I don't even try. I don't even think anybody is gonna read this far.

"Hello everyone, 

I've been struggeling with this issue for a long time now. 
As long as I can remember, my mom had an odd way of expressing her love and nurturing my growth. 

I remember when I was 13 she would make me scrub the floors on my bare knees because I didn't help around enough in the house. While doing that she would sing along to a song, calling me a coward and a weakling. 

She also saw me develop my eating disorder but never said anything untill it was too late. I've lost a lot of weight since then and come a long way but she never fails to rub it in my face. Even if I eat an apple as a snack, she would tell me to ""Watch the line"". 

These are just mere fragments of how she is towards me. Recently, I was talking to her about life partners. She flat out told me that, if anyone were to love me, they'd have to choose it very profoundly because I make everyone have a hard time.

Now, don't get me wrong, I did have a rebellious teen period. I just don't know why she can't get a new image of me? Does anyone have tips on how to survive this passive agressive fiesta my mother has? Maybe things I can do to show her how I've changed?

Would it be an idea for me to get some counseling? Pls help me...

"For starters I'm 17 and from the uk. I've been depressed for about a year now, there's been ups and downs, and times where I've felt less shitty in between but it always falls back down to me being pretty badly depressed again. Thing is, it's not good, I'm miserable or numb most of the time right now and I'm so emotionally tired that I can't handle doing anything other than sleeping most of my days away at the moment. I snap out in anger at my entire family and I've been having pretty bad thoughts about my life in general lately. 

I fucking hate it. I want to get better(or not be around anymore if the former isn't ever possible), I can't deal with it all. 

Problem is whilst everybody tells you to seek help, how does one actually go about getting help? I'm homeschooled so I can't seek out a school counsellor or similar, my family is really poor so we can't afford a therapist or anything private.

Can somebody please help me and give me some information as to how they got help. How do I proceed now I've made the decision to seek some out? ",4,nap out in anger at my entire family and I've been having pretty bad thoughts about my life in general lately

I know she likes having me around but I can't shake the thought that everyone would be better off without me. I feel so close to giving up. I have supportive parents which I'm grateful for, and a few friends but I'm feeling an extremely strong urge to isolate myself completely.

"Hey all, sorry for the upcoming long-winded post but yeah, I'm feeling so down the past few months.

All started when my elder brother moved in, but before that, a brief background. I remember I used to have dreams of a particular job; well-adjusted, motivated. All of that ended when my eldest brother turned tail on me and accused me of selling secrets to a third-party, which I never did, but knowing that I might have wronged him, I apologized in a semi-self justifying way. That was my mistake, and of course he never accepted it. He was also backed by his wife and his wife's family over his decision to accuse me.

I looked up at him like a son would to his father, and his betrayal wrenched my heart so much it still hurts inside.

Moving forwards, not even my elder brother believed me, and kept telling me to admit my fault, in which case I never did anything. I also felt betrayed, but until the fateful day he was kicked out of living with my eldest brother, he didn't believe me and I rather liked living a pointless, solitary life with depressed me and my aunt. I didn't feel alive, but neither did I feel so utterly dead.

Now, when he moved, he's kinda bossy; the type to demand respect and not earn it. He forced me to find a job which created pressure and friction to my ego, because while I knew I was getting nowhere, I also needed the job, but he kept berating at me and my uselessness. It further spiraled my depression. This was the 'first' phase. Knowing full well nothing would go well with our permanent arrangement, I found a job at a colorless call center, which while greatly paying, stole all life I had on dreaming and hoping, and painted me an utter cynic. I only looked for the high of getting pay, feeding myself, and of course, pretending I was well while I was abused by customers. This of course continued until it was bearable to a point, but I was transferred between accounts. This shift in the playground furthered my lifelessness and having been moved to Comcast, because fuck Comcast, I handed my resignation and left the company. I found a job in sales, but the accumulated cynicism in the last 6-8 months killed whatever ability I had to close a sale. This was my fault, and no sooner than 2 months they kicked me out. I felt... free and semi-happy after that, ironically. It was shortlived, because I am fretting at the lack of funds I have (rather I built up some savings but I don't have income; that's distressingly worrying).

The call-center depression was over and I initially steeled myself to finding day-shift jobs. But, whatever happened, I wasn't able to find a job; due to circumstances, I can't *not* declare my 2 month stint because it would reflect on my taxes and I could get kicked for that. So I had to justify myself to companies who weren't really biting it. I don't want to go back to a call-center, but I guess I would still have easy entry over there.

This brings us to now. My elder brother is berating me for a lack of jobs, and when I ask him for advice, he basically tells me the obvious 'just get over it, be positive, yadda.' If I knew how to do that, I wouldn't want to stay being depressed. Then he throws me the bomb that I should shut up because my negativity was affecting him, and he wants to stay positive.

I feel massively betrayed and not too long ago I wanted to scream but it's the early mornings; I'd rather not. So I now feel incredibly useless, because I can't find a job I can tolerate, I feel non-functioning, all I do is worry other people and emit negativity, and I can't really help myself in any substantial way. Not even faith is helping me; it's even preventing me from dying because I'm too scared.

I feel so utterly useless and defeated, and I keep wondering why, if there's a protector watching above, why would they allow this? And I am so stretched apart I feel pained all over. Hell, basically all I do is mull over important decisions without deciding on one.

I feel so useless; and while I would want to visit a psychiatrist, I don't have the funds to maintain it.

I just wish I knew how to help myself. I'm still attached to the shadows of my past I can't move on to find better things.

I wish I didn't exist to trouble other people. So, apologies for having you listen to my rant; I have no idea what I was hoping to achieve here, looking back.",4,ldest brother turned tail on me and accused me of selling secrets to a third-party

The issue I'm having though is that I feel like a completely different person. In some ways it's good, but I feel like I'm re-learning how to live. Some of my interests have changed, things physically feel different, I don't feel as invested in my relationships, and in a strange way I miss my depression because it was like a comforting imaginary friend that was always there.

"Kinda lengthy post, but I'm just really lost right now so my apologies in advance... 

So today, my best and only friend, he finally gave up on me. I've tried my very best to hide my depression from him, even going as far as constantly putting a mask on and suppressing my true emotions in an attempt to appease him and not become burdensome. But as many of you well know, that tends to become rather exhausting real quick... and sometimes our depressive nature shows. And today mine showed. He wanted to hangout and watch something, and I wasn't feeling up to it at all, so I politely let him know. He then went on to say in response ""You're always in such a gloomy mood... stop trying to make people feel bad for you cause it's not gonna happen."" He then told me that I need to grow up and that he doesn't want to talk to me for a while until I grow up... 

I'm not sure what to do now, like how I should go about this. I guess I just need some advice and/or guidance fellas. Anything will be immensely appreciated. Thank you for at least taking the time to read.",4,"my best and only friend, he finally gave up on me, tried my very best to hide my depression from him, even going as far as constantly putting a mask"
"It's like cancer. ""You've got 4 months to live."" But sometimes for some reason you outlive their prognosis. ""You've lived for 3 months more!"" It's like suicide. You choose a week. Or you think this week will be the last one. And surprisingly, when THE day comes...it goes just as it comes and you are still breathing. 

When do you know it's time? Well, I've been spinning in circles for a while now. Round and round and round. Joy, sadness. Over and over and over again. 

In my dream world, I would be happy, not angry, not sad. I would finally be able to evolve into the woman I envision myself as instead of constantly grabbing her by the cuff of her sleeve. And I would finally publish my book, and be confident in the story. Maybe even sing some songs and feel confident about it. Have a guy who will love me and cherish me. Not control me, not contact me only when he wants something, not judging me and calling me chubby. 

Be able to be worthy enough for the attention of this one guy in my school. I always see him. Always. But he just doesn't see me. I guess that's how it's supposed to be. With a guy who looks like an Abercrombie Fitch model and a girl who looks like she sells tomatoes for a living. A guy who has nearly a thousand followers on Instagram and a girl who just has 400.

"Hello. To start Iâll say that my depression has always been a peaks and troughs kind of mindset in which good and bad events flip the trigger. Since high school, however thereâs been a lingering perpetual sadness and loneliness.

Iâve never been the person that connects well with other people. Iâve had small groups of friends and a lot of times I have trouble finding a deeper feeling of a strong relationship with those people, like they are surface level. 

Then there was a girl...
I met her freshman year of college and quickly we were together and happy. Whenever I think of times where my sadness and anxiety was completely irrelevant to me, it was times with her. Our third year of college, though she went abroad and broke it off. She tells me how she felt codependent with me and needed her independence, but loves me. This was the first of multiple times this has happened, and I fell into a very dark place. 

She came back, though for senior year, and we quickly got back together, the way things were.

When we graduated she wanted to move to a new city she fell in love with when interning for a summer. I had opportunity in the city we were in, and so we went separate ways. We stayed in touch for a few months until, for the second time, I got a call with the same speech I got when she went abroad. I thought that was it and I would move on. Sad, but I needed to try. I dragged through my life bitter at the place I was living and the thin to non-existent relationships I had with people. I even dated someone a few months later, but I was never happy with her, yet I stuck with it and got broken up with again. There I was, hurt by someone I didnât care too much about but at the fact I was alone and canât find a relationship quite like before. 

Now to a few months ago. A friend of both me and my college ex catches up with her unexpectedly when she was in town for a few days. She tells them she thinks about me sometimes and what could have been...and that sheâd be happy if I got in touch. I pounced on this opportunity. I didnât go into this expecting anything to come of it other than companionship, but as before, it fell back into how we always were together.

A month ago she calls me upset. Thereâs another guy where she is living and is torn between me and him. She tells me to âclaim what is mineâ and if I moved closer to her she could promise me we could try again. I tell her how I feel and what comes out of it is a trip to see her for New Years. I go to see her and I have never felt less depressed in my life. Being with her made me want to actively try to live happier, healthier, and work harder. 

Itâs hard to leave to come home though and both of us are anxious about what will happen. The day came when we had to talk about it and basically I felt like I needed to make a big play. It was either going to work, or I would go down knowing Iâd try. I told her how I felt when I was with her and that I was willing to move there and work everything out. I told her I loved her and itâs what I want to take a chance for......all I received, was for the third time, was indecisiveness and doubt. She said she didnât know if sheâs willing up everything she built from scratch in her new City and doesnât want to fall in her old feeling of codependency. I felt defeated and lost.

I know this was a long post, and I appreciate anyone who made it this far. The conclusion is I have never felt more alone and isolated in both the lack of relationships I have and the place I live. Iâm at a point where I donât know where I belong or the purpose I serve, and the girl I loved I wasnât good enough for, which feels like it transcends to everyone I put an effort into. Iâm not sure if Iâm looking guidance or just anyone to listen, but all in all, thanks for reading.

"More than ever, my motivation is just gone. I've been 'unhappy' for roughly 3 years (I've refrained from calling myself depressed since I haven't actually been professionally diagnosed with anything since I'm too afraid to get help). I don't feel like waking up anymore. I wake up briefly, then sleep until 3 in the afternoon. I haven't been going to sleep until 4:00 AM at the earliest, because I lie there and dwell on the dumb things that I've done in the past, think about the the things I'm afraid of for my future, struggle with my crippling loneliness-- I just can't fall asleep instantly.
I don't feel like eating. I have no appetite. I'm losing weight when I'm already too thin. Because of my social anxiety, I've isolated myself from everyone I used to know-- and now I have nobody. I'm too emotionally attached to a group of people that will never even know that I exist, so much so that the thought of them being gone someday completely breaks me. My feelings have only gotten worse, especially over the last two months. I've cried so many times over the past few days. I haven't taken care of myself at all.
I don't think I'd ever bring myself to take my own life, but the thought of randomly being put out of my misery seems so refreshing.
But I'm too afraid to speak up about it to anybody. I don't want to worry anyone. And the times that I have tried to subtly cry for help, I've only been responded to with ""Go home, lie down, drink some tea, and read a book-- you might feel better!"" but it doesn't work like that.

Im 17. I'm posting this on am account I've just created because if I get through this, I won't want other people to know I've written the post.

I've spent this evening preparing the place where I would hang myself. It's a storage room, at the top of our building. I've made a mess in order to leave space around the hanger in which I used to hang my bike because it's the only place where I think I can accomplish my purpose of ending my life. I've cried whole oceans of tears while doing, however, I was willing to do it. I swear I was, I was extremely afraid of what I would feel while hanging, but then I thought again about my life and came to the conclusion that it was worth it. However, I went down to my house in order to go to the toilet, eat, etc. (maybe those were just excuses set by the survival instinct?), saw my mother and cried again. I ended up having dinner with my family, doing some house chores and I can't hold my tears anymore (Actually, I've had to go out a few times so they didn't notice). I might be alive tomorrow night or might not; if I am (because I'm unable to hang myself), they will discover my hanging set-up because we will be putting away the Christmas stuff in the storage room. 

(sorry, now I can't think clearly, I can't share with you everything I'd like to, so I'll jump to the end right now)

What would happen if I told my mother? I know it might be the help I need to continue living but life we'll never be the same. I hope she doesn't freak out in the moment, but even if she wasn't, I don't want her to be worrying about whether I would try to commit suicide again, searching on the internet  ""how to help my teenager suicidal son"", if I would try to hurt myself with a new knife that she has bought or , if I would jump off a high building when I get the chance. Also, there might be some times in my life in which a psychological test is needed to access a new job or opportunity. What if due to my mother they find out that I've been/am suicidal? What if they tell my grandparents or someone in the family and they spread the word unintentionally?

I've never told anyone about my feelings, both ending my life and seeking help iin my parents induce me too much fear.

"First of all, I firmly apologize if this is long.
I just got dumped and had my heart broken. AGAIN!
My life is so fucking bad, I really want it all to end. I never had ANY success in my love life. Any relationship that I would enter, I would just get heartbroken. I've been terribly depressed before due to my other break-ups, but more than one year ago, I met this beautiful girl (let's call her Sara) who changed my life. At the time, she was the only good thing to come in my life. She was always there for me, she'd comfort me when I'm not okay, she'd make me laugh, she was just THERE and that's all I needed. She told me she loves me so many times and always used to say that she'll be here always and forever. And I trusted her. We've been together for over a year and I really got attached to her. I love her so fucking much. Throughout December, I was looking back at the past few months and couldn't believe how good my life has become, just because of that one person. 
Tonight, she just told me that she has changed. That she has made new decisions for 2018, that she completely changed. She explained how her love for me is simply leaving, and that's it. I haven't done anything, I've always been there for her, I did my best as a boyfriend. She didn't let me say anything, to try and change her mind. It ended so fast.
My whole life got destroyed tonight. She was my whole life. And I know I'm not getting her back. I love her so much and I don't know what to say. I've spent 2 hours just crying, thinking and listening to some music. I feel so empty, my heart just fucking hurts. I'm just thinking of ending it all. On top of that, I have other problems - my mother is sick and I have financial problems. She made it better. She gave me hope. I'm tired of it all. The pain, the tears and despair. I don't even understand anymore; HOW CAN IT GET BETTER? I don't see any possible scenario of my life getting better. I really wanted to share, and I have no one so close to me to really vent out. I only have Reddit.
Thank you so much if you read through this, it means so much. I'm broken right now. I don't know what's gonna happen to me or what I'll do.",4,"she completely changed. She explained how her love for me is simply leaving, and that's it"
"Hi there, I'm looking for a best friend, as the post says so. Looking for someone who understands the life of a depressed, and doesn't give stupid advice like ""it's all in your head, you just have to think positive"". Someone who doesn't give up on you no matter what. I'm specifically looking for a best friend instead of friend because most of the time, people don't take online friendships seriously. But I do. My friends are real humans with feelings. I'm ready to invest effort, time and emotions into a friendship that is worth it, even if it's just online :)

A little bit about me, I'm a 23 year old female. INFP, for any myer-briggs fans out there. I'm probably the most emotional person you'll ever see. My heart totally rules my head. But I do have morals which keeps me sane of course. I get attached pretty easily, and I'm pretty clingy. Maybe a bit too much for normal people to handle... But so far I've met some who can handle it :D My interests include writing poems, collecting cute stuff, singing, and thinking about life and possibilities.

Anything else you wanna know, find out for yourself! :D",4,"looking for a best friend instead of friend because most of the time, people don't take online friendships seriously"

"I have been having a very rough 15 months after a breakup which really shouldnât be the end of the world, but itâs really fucked me up. I moved back in with my parents and have had no energy or motivation to move forward with my life. Iâm also 29 so this is pathetic. I feel guilty for having depression because I should be far beyond this girl at this point but even with therapy and trying meds I cannot get my shit together. I almost feel as if Iâm making all this shit up at this point. Like my mood is permanently fucked up and my outlook is shit. I am really tired of this. 

Also, nobody ever move to central PA if you have depression. ",4,"very rough 15 months after a breakup which really shouldnât be the end of the world, but itâs really fucked me up,oved back in with my parents and have had no energy or motivation to move forward with my life"
"All I want is to die. I want to end this endless pain. Every moment is torture. Every day I come here with no response from her. Not even a look.
Every day she ignores me and for good reason. Because Iâm ugly. Because Iâm stupid. Because nobody has ever liked me and nobody ever will. Because there are thousands of guys sheâd rather be with than me. Because Iâm nothing to her. Because I literally disgust her or Iâm not even a flinching thought in her mind. Because Iâm not worth the thought. Iâm not worth anything. I should have killed myself a long time ago. I should go home and take pills, binge wine, and let myself fall into a sleep that I canât wake up from. Then the world can be rid of me. Which is all they ever really wanted.
Iâm a virgin. A 32 year old virgin. I feel ashamed. I feel like I donât belong anywhere and that no one wants me. I feel broken. I feel like I should have never been born or I should have died.
Iâve only had one âgirlfriendâ that lasted about a week. Then as soon as I mentioned I had anxiety and that I was a virgin, she dumped me. She realized how broken I was and ran for the hills. She did the right thing. I am broken. I donât deserve her. I donât deserve anyone. I just deserve to die. This whole life is a mistake. This whole life is a waste. Iâm sorry to everyone who knows me for my existence. Iâm sorry Iâm here. I donât want to be. I promise I wonât be very long.
I want to end it. I canât stand another day of this life. I canât take any more of this torture and suffering. Nobody cares. They donât. You donât care. They donât care. I donât care. Iâm done. Iâm done living in a world that doesnât care. A world that watches suffering unflinchingly and simply smiles and goes about their days not wanting to be bothered with things that are unpleasant.
Iâm tired of waiting for nothing. I feel like Iâm walking an endless road to nowhere. I just keep getting further and further away from what I once considered normalcy with every step I take.
God Iâve been fucked over so many times in my life. It feels like, if there is a God, He or She is hellbent on repeatedly torturing me by lifting me up with glimmers of hope before smashing me back down with crushing disappointment. This is the story of my life.
I want to die. I deserve everything bad because Iâm worthless. I just want it all to end now. Please let me die. Let an earthquake hit and the ground swallows me up. Let some asshole smash into my car in an intersection. Let me drown in an ocean. Just let it happen. I donât want to be here any more.",4,"she ignores me and for good reason, Because Iâm ugly, Because Iâm stupid, Because nobody has ever liked me and nobody ever will,she dumped me, She realized how broken I was and ran for the hills, She did the right thing, I am broken"
"Does anyone else find that theyâre suicidal only when theyâre alone?

I donât think Iâm emotionally broken. I just donât see a point in loving another person like I did before. why waist my time with that when I could make money instead? I like seeing the bills stack up. I legit even love the smell of it. I know itâs more to life then money and etc, but I donât want that stuff. I was thinking yesterday about what Iâd buy with my money and the answer is nothing. I just want it. and I beat myself up about it because I know better.

"Why is it that we often hold on to something that we shouldnât. We were two women early 20âs dated for 5 years. Our relationship faced many ups and downs as any relationship does. There were times that were easily defined as toxic. Then why do I still deeply miss her, she still remains as the first and last thought of every day. We donât speak, we donât associate through social media, all contact has been cut.

Little back story, like I said we were in a lesbian relationship together. She so badly wanted to get married and although I was unsure I knew essentially she was the person I would love to spend the rest of my life with. As we went through the process of getting a ring everything fell into place it had been 2 years without almost any fights. Finally the big day came, I proposed.
She said yes! Only to break up with me for âno reasonâ a week later. I was destroyed. She moved out nearly 3 months later and took her almost 5 months to admit she was sleeping with her male boss a week before I proposed.

I forgive her for these things that she mustâve been too ashamed to admit. She made me believe I was crazy when I noticed late night texts from her boss. Literally convinced me I had imagined seeing his name pop up on her phone, I suppose to cover up the fact she was doing something not very nice to the person she was supposed to marry. All and all thinking I was literally going crazy drove me to deep contemplation of suicide several times.

Thereâs more details involved that are to say the least twisted and sick but I was so desperately trying to hold on to her that I didnât think twice of her late nights 6 days of the week or helping her shave private places when she said she was hanging with friends..

When she left she told me it was easy for her to leave me just as she left her family for me. She came from a loving family unfortunately they were Jehovahs Witnesses so they disassociated with her immediately after finding out she had been dating a âworldlyâ female. 

I know sheâs damaged psychologically, and in my heart I just want to pick her up and help her through her problems. She wonât let me, and thatâs okay. But why do I miss her so? Why is she in my daily thoughts and nightly dreams? Itâs been a year and time will keep rolling, will I always miss this woman that wasnât healthy for me or herself?

Thanks if you actually read this and to all itâs okay if you didnât, simply feel a tad better getting these deep thoughts off of my chest.

"My boyfriend dumped me on Tuesday night. Yesterday afternoon I was really upset so I asked my ex boyfriend's best friend if we could hang out. We got coffee, talked and laughed about stuff and we made plans to hang out today. Yesterday night I was really upset so I asked him to come over. We got food and went back to my apartment. We talked for a while and I got really sad and started crying. He hugged me and told me that I'll be okay. I just really wanted physical attention and love at that point so I kissed him and straddled him and we made out for a while.



Today he came over and we just hung out and played cards and stuff. He said we should go for a drive which we did and then he wanted to show me his apartment. We went inside and he showed me around. We went into his room and he took his jacket off and we started kissing a lot. I laid in his bed and he got on top of me and we made out some more. He kept telling me how beautiful and gorgeous I am and eventually we had sex.

"Ever since my divorce it's been like trying to dig out of a pit. Everytime I climb I get pushed back down again. I haven't had a car since my divorce. I haven't had a good steady job in months.

My step dad that claims he loves and cares about me hasn't taken any time out for me at all since before my divorce. I lived in that house, alone, for six months. Not a single person came to visit me. Not one.

Right now I don't really see anyone. No one ever takes the time to really spend any with me. I had a girlfriend but her and I just broke up. I was told that I wasn't sexually attractive to her and that because I had to no car and no job she wasn't as attractive to me. *sigh*

I just don't want to live. I've lost so much in my life and feel like I've gained nothing. I really really wish I had a car and some help, but no one cares.
