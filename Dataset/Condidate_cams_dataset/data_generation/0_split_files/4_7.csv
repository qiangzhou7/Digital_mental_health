"2017 was a terrible year. I dealt with a horrible breakup. Depression and anxiety symptoms that had been held in check for a while became really bad. I lost a friend to suicide. I had my closest friends move away. I had physical health issues to deal with. I had some troubles at work.

The worst part of the year was that my dog got sick twice, and the second time was cancer. Like a lot of people, my dog has helped me through some really tough times. She's been the only reason I've gotten out of bed some days. I've had her for over 11 years. Six months ago she had some aggressive and expensive surgery to treat the cancer and it (seemingly) worked. She recovered well and is back to being her old high-energy self. The last couple of months I have felt so much better because she has too. 

Last week I found a lump on the site of her surgery. I'm waiting to see a specialist, but I'm devastated. If the cancer has returned I don't know if it will be treatable this time. I don't know if I can afford more surgery.

I'm not stupid - my dog is 11, and I know realistically she will only be around another couple of years at best. But I can't imagine life without her, especially now. I don't know how to handle her being sick again and potentially suffering. I can't handle her dying. I can't handle her being gone.

If you're not a pet person, you probably don't understand this, but for 11 years I've always had at least one thing that loved me and relied on me. She's kept me going and I don't know what to do without her. Thanks for listening.

**TL;DR: My dog may have cancer again, and I'm afraid of losing her.**

"Dad told everybody I'd be going while he knew I already had other plans with my friends. It's the first time I was welcome and invited by people to go out on NYE so I didn't want to lose the opportunity plus those family gatherings make me feel stupid, useless and even more depressed. Of course I went out and had great time (apart from one depressive episode). 
Next morning I wake up and browse Facebook I see a post from my Uncle (the gathering happens at his place) a photo of all of them and a caption saying ""Another year goes by, here with our loved ones"" then he changed line and wrote ""Hopefully everyone comes next year"". Don't know how to feel about this.",4,"those family gatherings make me feel stupid, useless and even more depressed"

"I am a 21 y/old male currently in my final year of university in the uk however I still live at home. I have been suffering with anxiety and depression since the age of 14/15 due to my upbringing and circumstances.

I was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness which meant at school I always felt different to everyone else and as such have kept my personal life extremely private. Even though I decided to leave the religion at the age of 16, a large number of my family remain in this religion. I've always therefore struggled to live a 'normal' life, and my small circle of friends still have no idea of my past.

Due to this, relationships with girls especially and making new friends is something I always avoid due to fear of them and everyone else finding out about me. Because of this, I've never had a girlfriend. When I keep to myself and get my head down and focus on university work I can usually put the anxiety to one side, however recently I met a girl who I like and she likes me and it's causing me great anxiety and depression again. She's always telling me about how close she is with her family and not only can I not relate, it annoys me I can't be the same.

I think it has a lot to do with me caring about what people think of me too much as I'm aware of people who left the religion in similar circumstance and have normal relationships and seem to not care.

I like this girl yet she's so opposite to me as she's really outgoing and how normal she is makes me scared she'll only think I'm weird when she gets to know me.

Any words of advice or help would be extremely appreciated. Thanks all",4,"due to my upbringing and circumstances, suffering with anxiety and depression since the age of 14/15 "
"PSA: when someone takes their life, the wrong thing to do is reach out to their closest friends asking for explanations surrounding their depression and general mental state. You certainly DO NOT state that you wish the deceased had reached out to their friends. NEWSFLASH: THEY WISH THAT TOO! This is not a time to point fingers, dig for answers, or to share just how much this has hurt you (I'm talking to you -- the people who have met my friend once or twice) -- especially over social media. Depression isn't simple. It is not brought on by having a few bad days at work. It is not remedied by a change of scenery, a phone call, or a quick trip to the doctors. The people who were closest to the deceased are not here to console you. Life is not about you. It is about the people who surround you. It is a time to celebrate the persons life who has passed, reflect inward, and reach out to those who are in your life and ask for what they might need.

"I'm 19, F and I absolutely hate my parents. They are the worst. All my mom does is take out her anger on me and criticize me. She is extremely judgemental in every single aspect that relates to me. But they treat my brother like he is the golden child. He sexually abused me and let his friends do it too. He can not to do anything wrong. My parents are ready to buy him a brand new car, but won't let me have gas money for the car that's already at home.
My parents honestly treat my brother with so much love and support and it breaks my heart to see them treat me like I'm some unwanted part of their life. 
They have told me multiple times that I should grateful because they feed me and provide for my education, like that isn't the responsibility of parents? They make it seem like it's a great and big deal that I'm not abandoned. They treat me like a slave and I get in trouble if I don't do anything they tell me to do.
I honestly hate every single moment I stay at home. My parents and my brother always gang up on me and ruin my mood constantly.
I have seriously considered suicide in the past to get away from this hell and I still live with them. But I have realised that is too easy for them. I don't want to end my life because of some assholes. I'm gonna study my ass off, get a good job enough to allow me to live on my own and never look back again.

"18 French M. I'm capable of doing so much things, as I already did it like great marks at school, writing stories, making music, et cetera. But shit, what is exactly the point ? I do absolutely not want to do anything. All I do of my time not spent at school is listening to music, watching YouTube vids and cogitating, and that's terribly useless. But I don't wanna die, because I known a giant love (took 2 years to forget, with some souvenirs coming over sometms), worth it to suffer for that; and because dying is as usefull as putting a hair in the street. So, I'm blocked in a useless, never stopping suffering circle, because of the demotivating thing keeping me from completing something.

"I just had another relationship end and I have no solid internal base, or friendships to fall back on.  I'm alone.  Has anyone gotten through this and genuinely felt like they were okay?
Here's how I feel:

-She broke up with me and said we're romantically incompatible.  How is it that I thought things were okay and she thought they were terrible.

-I'm 28 and have abandonment issues.  I so badly want a relationship but I am starting to wonder if I'm capable of having a healthy one.

-I have this sneaking suspicion that at some point I won't be able to keep going.  I've been so close to quitting several times and have barely pulled myself up but then it's all happened again.

-I am unable to foster healthy relationships with friends or otherwise.  I've been in therapy off and on for years and still can't do it. 

I know everyone is busy, but please, it would really help me to know that there are other people out there.  I feel very alone and just want someone to tell me it'll be okay.  Thank you.

"Iâve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression. Iâm on medication. I normally see a therapist but weâve been on a break for the last few months, although weâre restarting today.

I feel like Iâm falling apart internally. I constantly have a pain in my chest from the sadness. Iâve lost all my motivation and have to convince myself to get out of bed. I frequently look through the medicine cabinet and google how much of all the medications i would need to take to overdose. Iâve cut my thigh before and Iâve starting cutting my wrist, but not deep enough to scar.

The only really good thing in my life is my school. I love my teachers and my classmates, and I look forward to going.
I feel miserable at home. I feel bored and unmotivated. I donât want to do anything because nothing sounds like fun. I get really angry with people and then I get really sad that they donât want to be with me.

Iâve started ripping off my toenails and picking at the skin on my feet out of boredom but also because the pain distracts me from everything.

I have passions, I have hopes. I want to start an Etsy store and make crafts. But I feel like it would never work.

Iâm just absolutely miserable right now. But Iâm really good at masking it. I told my mom the other night that I didnât feel safe because I was so sad and she told me Iâd be fine and left the room. I stayed up all night considering sneaking out and jumping off a bridge.

Itâs weird because Iâm able to be stable at school but when I get home I feel like Iâm being suffocated. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist today. I want more help. I want better medication, I want to be fixed. But I donât know what to say. Once I leave he house I feel fine and I donât feel the need to ask for help.

Nothing bad has occurred in my house. No drama or trauma of any kind. I donât understand whatâs happening.

tl;dr: I feel fine emotionally whenever Iâm in public or at school. I feel miserable at home and frequently consider suicide and self harm. I get mood swings and alienate my family because of them.

"What do you think makes you feel depressed? What makes you feel suicidal? What stops you from attempting it? What do you do to find peace? What keeps you going?

I've had depression for awhile mainly caused by an unstable family/home and never addressing my issues or feelings. One day when I was younger everything just hit me at once, a family member I was close to just up and left, this left me feeling alone, I also met a girl which at the time I couldn't fully comprehend what I felt for her but she was messed up to from family and all I could really do was cry about my life because I never had anyone I could really talk to about what caused me pain. Needlessly to say this relationship didn't last long and damaged me more so I found myself sitting in the floor with a knife thinking if I'm alone and I can't connect to people and I can't process this pain how can I stay here, how do I keep living. Something snapped and I decided I wouldn't kill myself, that I had to live my life regardless because I risked endding my life before happyness came, before seeing what life could bring, i also told myself i was stronger then this so i made the mistake of burying everything and deciding I wouldn't take shot anymore. This worked out for awhile, I found new confidence in myself, I stood up to anyone or anything I needed to, for awhile I felt invincible untouchable. It wasn't until these last few years that everything I buried came back up. It broke me, it zapped me of all my confidence and strength. I never learned to express my feelings and I always had a sense that my problems if expressed to other people were a burden so in turn I died emotionally, I became a poison to my life and the people around me, I damaged good relationships in my life. Being emotionally dead wasn't a fix either so eventually my mind started to wake parts of me up and it made me flip out, it was like waking up from a nightmare where I saw all the damage I did but unlike a nightmare this was reality. I broke down because I saw myself losing everything that held meaning to me in life and in a fit of pain I hurt myself trying to hide from it all and further damaged my relationship. 

Right now I feel like I'm in between my life working out or coming crashing down. I've been dealing with my past issues and I do feel like I'm better mentally then I've been but my emotions still get the best of me. I'm forced on 1 person I want to spend my life with, trying to repair damages, trying to find a way to explain how and what I've felt. I have other points in my life that need attention, ones that if I deal with will bring me closer to this person but I can't not fouces on them, I just want them to see me, understand what I felt, understand it was hard on my too.

Idk where I was going here. I just kinda needed to talk. I guess my point as to what I asked in the beginning is I'm still here living and I don't plan on stopping because I feel like I can achieve what I want but not if I take my life. Life is going to be hard, harder for some them other's but I'm still going to try for happiness and I'm still going to try to make life happy for the one I love whom I hurt emotionally without meaning to.",4,had depression for awhile mainly caused by an unstable family/home and never addressing my issues or feelings
"I been feeling so depressed and it's been already 3 years of it. No matter how many attempts I do to explain it to my parents they actually think im an attention seeker.

Nonetheless, I thought having my bf would be another solution and ya he was trying but now he is being so cold and saying he feels suffocated.

I wanna escape im so tired of feeling like I cause burden to ppl and my bf is giving up...my parents dont understand...im running out of options and breaking down.

"I can't bring myself to enjoy anything social anymore. I can't be around my family because I'm sick of faking my happiness, I can't be with my friends because they don't realise the extent of my depression and I always bum them out by being too anxious to say anything.

I then deeply upset her for not congratulating her and she instantly started saying I was being a bad friend. She's aware that the girl I've liked for years is attending this party with her boyfriend (which is obviously extremely uncomfortable) but she told me to suck it up for one night so she can enjoy herself but... I just can't any longer, I'm sick of pretending I'm fine for the sake of others. So in the end me and this friend have fallen out ever since and I've decided I'm not going to this party for my own sake, I get the feeling that this will upset her but I just cant endure any more of this torment.

"i just really need to get this out, i feel so much guilt and shame.

a friend of mine that i was once really close with (and shared romantic feelings and moments with over the years) killed himself two nights ago.

we had a stupid fight late 2015 and it wasn't until mid 2016 we finally apologised to each other and made amends. he had bipolar, he was always very open about it. i struggle with depression and anxiety. when we started talking again, i had not long broken up with a partner and was taking it really hard and trying to cope by abusing drugs and alcohol - i was not in a good place. he was very manic, immediately leaning very heavily on me and wanted to see me. he was also recently heartbroken.

i felt pressure and after our time apart was, in all honesty, thrown off by his intensity and made excuses not to see him. 

we caught up a couple of months later and again, he was very manic. but he was the same person i knew and loved and i was happy to be with him again. however that night we were drinking and popping pills, and we were heavily flirting. after a tender moment he kissed me and he wanted to start things up with me, to 'give us a shot'. telling me how beautiful i was and that we always had a connection etc. i got awkward and avoided him for a while after that. he made attempts to hang out with me and i avoided and made vague excuses.

the next couple of months i culled my social media (i was really weird and anxious about my privacy) and deleted anyone who wasn't in my immediate circle at that time, which included my friend. when he realised, he was hurt and we fought. 

he told me how much he had been struggling, dealing with suicide hotlines... i stood my ground, told him he was too intense... looking out for number one, i forgot to listen and care about my friend who just wanted support and someone to be by his side.

we made plans to hang out at a friends house around 7 months ago. he was, again, manic and abusing his prescription drugs. i was concerned, but mostly irritated at his intensity. we however left with a hug and on good terms.

7 months later he killed himself.

this post is all over the place and doesn't do our relationship justice, i am focusing on the fights we had and the ways i let him down because they are all i can think about. i feel so horrible and guilty. struggling with my own depression, i should have been there for him.

"I'm in a perpetual state of worsening pain and improving ability to just keep on going regardless. At this point, I don't think my mind can be broken. I'm not sure that's a good thing. My body is already breaking down. I'm only 23 and I'm in constant fear of dying from my body refusing to take any more stress (traditional blacksmithing as a long-term goal, construction type work to afford to pursue it, both are pretty hard on the body) without any semblance of motivation to do so or happiness as a reward. I don't even remember what it's like to be happy. 

I don't want to be happy. I **want** to be unhappy. That's all I have, the ability to not need the thing that most people want so much, that they dedicate their entire life to get it. I lose that and all I have is a couple ungrateful, unsupportive, incompetent shits for a family(my parents and my little brother, not a family started by me) of whom I have to work overtime to feed(I don't know if that's proper grammar, English is not my native language) and barely functional body for like 20 more years.

"I'm exhausted, I have been for years. If I'm not exhausted it's because I'm running on adrenaline.

For years I've been trying, I try at work, I try with my friends &amp; I try when I'm on my own. It's exhausting trying with little progress, often regressing back to a state of depression.

I'm so tired of people getting bored of me, sometimes it takes a week, sometimes a month, sometimes a year. Eventually everyone gets bored (and the few who aren't bored of me, they are always so busy). Don't get me wrong, I do have a bunch of brilliant friends, who are fantastic to hang out with. I do genuinely believe they enjoy my company, but when I'm down and want to talk to them they don't want to know. They push me away when I need them most.

I really want a long hug, not just a quick one to say hello or goodbye. Even better to snuggle up in front of a movie with someone and just for an hour or so feel embraced and less broken.

And yet I constantly feel detached from all of this, I get moments where I feel like I am inside this body but not connected to it. I feel distant from all those around me.

Then theres the confidence issue, I've always had some problems with confidence. Sure I'm great at being outwardly confident should I be at work sorting problems out, or in charge of a bunch of people whist running an event. I can take the lead when I have to.

"Some background information:

My lowest points were 2014 and 2015. I was 15 and my family moved to another country, but it wasn't what I expected which led me to stay isolated in my apartment for three years. I was too paranoid the people I met at school would see me active on social media and ask me why I haven't been in school. Which also meant I didn't contact my friends back home for a while.

When I visited home it was during the summer and we could only afford to stay two weeks. I tried to do as much as I could in those two weeks which made everything feel rushed.

In 2016, my last year before moving back home, I was in a long distance relationship, it was going great in the beginning but towards the end I could tell something was different and it led me to become obsessive with his activity on social media. We broke up before I moved back home but I found out my friend, who introduced me to my ex, and him liked each other. It did hurt since he was my first boyfriend and I felt worthless and I didn't deserve love because this was the outcome. I also knew they hung out but she was my best friend and I trusted both of them 100%. I have never felt betrayal like that. I wanted support from my friend group but they werenât there for me so I lost them as well. 

I am friends with another girl who is separate from that friend group and she was all I had when I moved back. When I was living away I felt so homesick but now that I was back I didnât feel welcomed. This all happened in May of 2017. 
Making friends has been difficult, I notice Iâve been having trust issues and I donât let people get close easily. But I also crave a connection with people. I also feel left out when I see people I know doing stuff without me. Sometimes I get obsessive of other peopleâs activity on social media and all it does is make me feel worse and I want to stop. I never felt this way before moving so I feel like these are bad habits and patterns I developed while being away.

**Here are my main concerns/tl;dr: I notice myself spacing out a lot and focusing on the past rather than the present, sometimes I check where people are or what theyâre doing via social media but it becomes obsessive, I donât like that I get concerned about other people and care too much about what they think, and I feel like I focus on the negative too much.**

I feel lost but I know I want to be in a better place. The solutions might be simple but my emotions are clouding my judgment. I know this was long but I appreciate any help or advice. Thank you in advance.

"I experienced intimidation at school, and my story will undoubtedly be different from what you have read in the past.

Because I am psychopathic by definition - diagnosed by few psychiatrists - what I have learned from that encounter will help you see intimidation from a different perspective.


**The story**

When I was younger - in high school - two famous guys from the volleyball team tried to bully me.

They would laugh at anything I would do, and others followed;  most are easily influenced because of a lack of critical ability, after all.

They cursed, started rumors, and shouted insults to make sure the others and I heard them.


**Indifference**

I have learned a lot from these episodes. I have watched them go through all kind of emotions, and it was easy to see they needed to fill a void.

My utter and complete indifference made it worse.  I did not give the attention they were seeking so severely. I witnessed their behaviors toward me without any concerns; I was only interested in learning more about human interactions.

You can learn from every experience in your life, good or bad, only if you take the time - and the required energy - to interpret why the reasons the experiences happened.


**The crowd**

At that time, I expected they would go further with their intimidation - after all, they had not gotten what they wanted; and they did not disappoint.

The larger of the two guys got physical - he had to - words were useless. From my perspective, and judging from his facial expression, it seemed like he pushed me as hard as he possibly could. Then, my back hit the wall, and I fell on the floor right after.

What followed was phenomenal. Everyone that I could see from my vantage point stopped talking. They had that dramatic look in their eyes; they were eager to see how I would react.

Fantastic, because it was a real representation of how limited most humans are. What happened is unquestionably unacceptable in the eyes of the majority of people - and yet - only one person, out of almost fifty, reacted with what looked like genuine empathy.

The rest did not move an inch to help. They watched, anxiously awaiting what was going to happen next. Some out of fear, but the vast majority were just thrilled to witness a possible act of violence.


**You are in control**

What I have learned, and still find useful to this day, is that nearly everyone you encounter in your life is not worth your time, and even less so, your energy. Even if they're not, you need to be respectful with your entourage: it's a necessity to thrive in any society.

You are in control of who you accept in your inner circle; thus you have the courtesy of choosing wisely. From my experience, only one out of fifty should be considered investing your time with.

It was out of the question I would react the way they expected it - I had to see how they would respond if I didn't do anything. Thus, I got back on my feet and continued on my journey.

They didn't cross the line because I still had to learn. I required a code to make sure I could live socially - it is the interpretation of these experiences that would allow me to build its foundations.

That one person who stood out of the group, and who later explained everything to the authorities - made me realize she was worth investing the time.


**You are the strong one**

If you are bullied, feel intimidated, and/or rejected: it is imperative you realize, right now and from now on, you are the strong one. The ones who intimidate you would never be able to withstand - even for a second - what you are going through. 

They are weak, and unlike you, they don't have the strength to control their most elementary feelings. It is fundamental to understand that very few people have the tenacity you possess. You have an attribute that makes everything achievable: self-control.

When you think about it, is there anything else you can control entirely besides yourself?


**The necessity to talk to someone**

It is useless to let these bullies intimidate you one more time. Use your strength, which very few possess, but you do. Remember to talk to someone about it. Take the time to look around you - it is mathematical - there is one person out of 50 in your entourage who will be worth your time, who is willing to listen to what you have to say, and who is going to stand up for you.
It is your responsibility to give that opportunity to that person. Use your strength to talk to someone and share how you feel; you will be surprised how much it will help.

You also have to acknowledge you are not alone. Others feel the same and are enduring the same situation. While all situations are different, inevitably, the solutions are all alike.

To those who intimidate, you are weak, and your actions are only a representation of your lack of confidence in yourself and a clear illustration of how low your self-esteem is.

One good start for you to display real strength - let's face it, you need it - is to apologize. If you still believe that intimidating others is a display of power, try the opposite.


**We want to hear your story**

You are all welcome, whoever and wherever you are, to share how you feel and what's on your mind with all of us, in a place where respect is fundamental.",4,"those who intimidate, you are weak, and your actions are only a representation of your lack of confidence in yourself and a clear illustration of how low your self-esteem is"
"Hi there. 

Iâm a 24 yo lady newly married to my best friend. We rent a nice house, have two great dogs (and a grumpy cat), and I have a steady job that I normally find challenging and rewarding. 

But Iâm still depressed. I canât remember a time when I wasnât. 

My father abused me as a child and Iâve been raped as an adult (before I met my husband). Lately (as in within the last three months), Iâve been experiencing really weird symptoms that are hard to explain. Itâs like my mind is disassociated from my body and Iâm a robot. I see the world through a pane of dirty glass and Iâm not really in control of anything. I see things that arenât there (but I realize isnât reality), like my hands seeming smaller than usual. Iâve googled those symptoms and, surprisingly, depersonalization disorder popped up.

I also have a lot of anxiety (Iâve been previously diagnosed with GAD), and have panic attacks probably three or so times a week. 

I often (daily) have flashbacks of being abused and raped, and am easily triggered by hearing certain words or seeing certain items. I relive those horrors at least once a day. 

My husband knows of my past and is very supportive. I feel so guilty when Iâm not able to get out of bed on my days off of work to do house chores and such, even though he doesnât make me feel that way. He says itâs okay, but he wants me to see a therapist because itâs hard for him to see me like this. 

Iâm working on seeing a therapist, but Iâm very anxious about it. Iâve seen a few therapists before and I feel like they either A) didnât help or B) helped, but talking about my issues brought up a lot of bad memories Iâd forgotten/blocked out. Reliving those memories made me so depressed last year, I was admitted to a psychiatric ward, which was so awful. I donât want to be in a place like that again. 

Lately, Iâve been making huge mistakes at work because of my inability to focus. Iâm trying really hard every day, but I still end up making mistakes. Itâs very frustrating when I see all my effort and hard work isnât enough.

I guess I donât know what Iâm asking. I called a therapist today (after a lot of googling to find one I think I would like) and got her voicemail, but didnât leave one. Iâm just so scared to tell someone these symptoms Iâve been experiencing because they sound so crazy to me. I donât want anyone to think Iâm crazy. And I definitely donât want to be sent back to a psych ward.

"I'm not even close to the same person I used to be. I understand that people change and that's normal/healthy but every step along the way I've just been getting worse. I rarely feel happy anymore, the only emotion I really feel is anger or hatred for anyone and anything. Everything annoys me. Earlier today I was talking with my mom and when she started saying things that pissed me off without even thinking I slammed the box of pills I was fiddling with onto the table, sending them everywhere and stormed off. I immediately felt regret for what I did but I can't just take it back. I don't enjoy hanging out or talking to people anymore, I very rarely have passion for anything anymore and I don't understand why or how I even became this way. This isn't how people are supposed to live, how do I fix my view on the world? I have absolutely no idea what to do, I just feel like I'm in such a dark place mentally. Relationships of any kind are difficult for me because I just don't care about people enough to maintain those relationships. Sorry this is just kind of an outpour of whatever I'm thinking at the time but I'm just genuinely pretty lost as to what I can do to improve my mental state. I don't know what I'm looking to get out of this post, I guess just some advice? Anything really. I'm 20/male &amp; unemployed, I don't know how to drive and my mom can't really teach me so I feel pretty stuck in that regard, I also owe ~$400 to my credit card company because of some debts I couldn't pay when I quit my job at a movie theater for another job (that I already had a start date for) and then something went wrong in their systems and I was out of a job, haven't been able to find one since so that's probably part of why I might feel this way, subconsciously? I also gained a lot of weight in the past few months after losing a lot, from 210lb to almost 160 and I'm pretty sure i'm back to where I started, I want to join the Air Force for a few years to help pay for college but first I need to get fit again which is pretty daunting considering all the weight I just put back on and my unhealthy eating habits. 

Anyway, that's about it. It feels a little better to type it all out but I would appreciate some kind of advice. Throwaway account but I'll be around for the next 2-3 days. Thanks for reading.",4,"Relationships of any kind are difficult for me, just don't care about people enough to maintain those relationships"
"Long story short: In december I talked to my mother about how I feel and that I currently don't get my shit together; Mainly work.
She asked whether it's ok if my family would know (If they asked questions after christmas etc) and I told her it would be ok. First thing she did was going to my aunt and telling her and now my whole family knows and everyone is super protective and sending help, which is exactely what I don't need. When I critizied her, she started the whole ""everything I do is wrong""-bullshit and now even my father called me, who is currently in hospital because of his weak heart and told me I should start using my brain.

While I'm writing this my mother sits crying in the kitchen after she told me that she can't deal with this whole current situation and that I ""don't live alone on this planet"".

"So, there's this podcaster/YouTuber I stumbled upon, and in one of his recent videos, the topic of suicide comes up. In the video, he speaks about all the suicidal messages he recieves from people 
all around the world who listen/watch him. As he goes on, it gets harder for him to talk about it, and it reaches the point where he breaks down, where just describing the messages puts him in tears, as you can tell how much he cares for these people and how much he can empathise with them.

But, I just don't understand it. As much as I try to get it, I can't. Why do people weep for us? Why do they care so much? Why do they spend so much time and resources helping us get better? And with 7.6 billion other happy souls out there, why should one or two lives even matter?

"I'm really into computers and gaming and shit, I have a 4k pc setup that's probably ~$3,000. 250 games, probably about 1,000 movies, 70,000 songs, nice speaker setup, studio headphones, you get the idea. I've loved this shit my entire life and in the last week I've realized that I don't even play games any more. Steam shows 0.0 hours played the last 2 weeks. I don't watch Netflix, I maybe listen to like 10 songs in a day, I used to have it on all the time. I basically just sit on Reddit refreshing the page hoping to see a news article that makes me think for .0001 seconds. 

I've been trying to hang out with my friends who are back in town for the holidays but I'm super fucking negative. All the stuff I would say in a conversation would be tearing down a person or an idea. My ""top 3"" friends leave today, tomorrow, and Friday. I'm gonna be stuck in a room with an entertainment system I don't even want to use. An entertainment system that I built specifically to keep me occupied because nothing else would. 

I thought I was drinking because I didn't care but now I realize I cared about recognizing my indifference. I really don't give a shit now. I was smoking weed whenever I got a chance. I don't even want to be high any more.

Let's just say that I don't think that i'm worth living here. Im tired of my own life. First I'm so ugly and don't tell me that everyone is beautiful because i literally am ugly. A lot of people told me that straight to myself. I care about my health but i can't do anything with my ugly face. Second i'm not good at anything and in school i'm the one to joke about.

"I'm sure this has been answered a million times, but I can't find an answer that fits my specific situation, so wanted to ask myself.  I don't know if I should post this in /suicidewatch because I'm sitting at work thinking about this and won't go home tonight or in the future to try and commit suicide, but I will move it there if people think it's more appropriate there.

I think about suicide a lot. At least once a day but probably more, and it isn't a fleeting though; I dwell on it.  Recently my favorite band lost its lead singer to suicide and when I found out the method, the first thing that came into my head was ""yeah, this is how I'd do it too.""  Yesterday I was driving down the road and couldn't really shake the idea of ""yeah, I could totally just slam my car into this highway median going 90mph,"" and almost felt a physical tension as my conscious mind restrained my arm from turning the wheel.

That being said, I'm not actively suicidal in that I don't want to die, and while I was diagnosed with depression ten years ago when I was a Peace Corps volunteer, it was largely considered a malpractice diagnosis and was situational at best.  

I don't mind being alive, and I have fun with the people I love, do the things I'm interested in doing, have an amazing family who loves me, etc.  A lot of the time I feel happy.  I just get really tired sometimes (a lot), everything seems like a hassle to a degree, and in areas of my life professionally especially, I feel like I'm always coasting on mediocre and feel like I'll always be mediocre / kind of lost in what I'm doing (and if someone feels otherwise and that I'm doing really well, it's because somehow I pulled the wool over their eyes).  I can't concentrate on ANYTHING.  It takes a lot to get me out of the house to do social things, but once I do, I enjoy myself, and I travel a lot.  Life simultaneously seems like it's flying by and like it's creeping along.  

Is this normal?  Is this something I should be worried about? I'm having a hard time even verbalizing this in a way that I feel like makes sense. ",4," It takes a lot to get me out of the house to do social things, but once I do, I enjoy myself,can't concentrate on ANYTHING, "

On the right, is a cute birthday card that my little brother made for me. (Spider-Dan is another nickname of mine) in it, he thanks me for being the best brother he could have and drew a picture of himself and I fighting against a monster whilst I was super saiyan.

Seeing these two items instantly made me burst into tears. I just sat here crying, feeling completely broken. Guilty of the way I feel and how I want to die, knowing I have family that loves me.

I tried to get a GF, but each time it has ended the same way, with me being shoved away and them not wanting me. It is ripping me apart mentally. I have given so much to others thinking I would be given the same amount of love back, but that isnât the case. I just want one thing, someone to love because then I know I am not going to be alone for the rest of my life because right now all I think about everyday is the fact that I am alone in all of this. If I canât even have that then what can I have? None of my friends can truly sympathise with me because they simply havenât experienced my pain on this level. Iâm not sure if anyone in the world have experienced what I have. This feeling of loneliness and hopelessness is just killing me inside. I wish I can just quit now and leave early because I donât want to see this game out to the rest of what it has to offer.",4,"want a GF because I think that having someone to love, someone to comfort and generally someone to just look forward to seeing again "
"So that I could see exactly why I'm so repulsive.

I have no idea what it is. I used to just tell myself it's because I'm not super attractive but now I'm getting paranoid I drive people away with some shitty aura that is completely out of my control. This is arguably worse because at least I can work on my physical appearance to a degree.

I try so hard to be there for people, try to be a good friend, etc. But eventually everyone just drops me anyway.

I can't be myself around people because who I really am is a depressed, negative, pessimistic, hopeless, self loathing piece of shit. I can't help it, this is what you become when life and people shit all over you for years on end. So I try to be more positive, but I have to fake it because I'm naturally a depressing downer.

I don't know what it is but people don't seem to ever want to stick around in my life. It seems like everyone just eventually vanishes into thin air and stops talking to me all of a sudden. This goes for relationships but it also applies to some friendships that I mistakenly believed were very close. People don't like the real me but they don't seem to like the fake me either so I have no idea what to do with myself.",4,seems like everyone just eventually vanishes into thin air and stops talking to me all of a sudden
