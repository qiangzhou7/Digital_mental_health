"Nobody understands me so I hoped reddit could help. 

As said in the title, I am 14 years old. I am struggling with terrible memory. I will give a few examples.

At school we were passed out tests. Since we share tables, we got 4 papers on one table. I wrote my name down and was waiting for further instructions until I heard someone say ""wow you are fucking retarded"" to me. I was in shock. I asked why acting like my feelings weren't hurt and he held up two papers to my face. I wrote my name on two papers. I didn't know how it happened and nobody else wrote it because it was my writing. I know I did it. And to be honest, I was about to write my name on a third paper. 

When a friend pours out his heart telling me about his problems and personal problems, I forget them within 10 minutes and when I asked him what it was again he thought I was a terrible friend. I didn't know what to do. 

There's not a day at school I have kept one pencil throughout the whole day. I always forget and I can tell the teachers are pissed because I am constantly asking if they have one.

I constantly ask my friends about questions in class and I asked him so many times he told me to shut the fuck up. He apologized and was just angry I was constantly bugging him but now that I can't ask him it is affecting my grades.

Speaking.of which, my grades are plummeting. My father asked if I am studying and doing my homework and I am, I study every night even on breaks and I still fail. I once studied for a quiz for three hours and got a 46 percent. 

I can't remember my childhood. I forget I had one. It's almost like I was born at the age of 12 because that's as far as I can remember. I have no memories of my childhood.

I loved my grandma. Ever since I was a baby I constantly went to her house on the weekends and she was like a parent to me. We were tight. When she passed away from the evil hands of cancer I couldnt remember her face. I cried to god because I could not remember her. I asked what was wrong with me. So far, religion has helped me none.

I have not told anyone this but I still don't know my multiplication tables. I'm not even good with addition. If you asked me what 8 * 9 is I would take a calculator for me to figure it out. A high school teacher pointed it out to me and I have been hurt ever since. I remember I forgot everything over the summer of 5th grade, and when 6th grade came along I had to ask my teacher how to multiply. She thought I was an idiot. All she said was ""Ha, you don't know yet?"". Looked at me like I was an alien. I looked at her for a minute and said nothing. Then went back to my seat, sat down, and thought I was a fool. 

I forget my families birthdays.

I forget basic mathmatics.

I forget my address.

I forget my phone number.

I forget my passions.

I forget my dreams.

I even forget my age.

I thought my cat was 1, turns out after my sister laughed for 15 minutes she told me he was 3.

I love my cat.

I've had dozens of people in my life tell me I'm stupid. I get bullied because of my memory loss. I get called mental almost every day. my closest friends think I am an idiot. My teachers, my parents, all of my loved ones, etc think I am stupid.

I told my father this. I started crying in front of him and you know what he told me?

You don't listen.

I have not visited a doctor because my dad doesn't believe me.

Please somebody, what is wrong with me. I go to bed at 8 and wake up at 7, I love to eat healthy because my mom force fed me salad as a child (I don't remember that), I have not had depression or anxiety until now because only now I wonder why I am this way, I do cross country, and I am an overall healthy boy.

For the love of God somebody help me.",4,"struggle with memory, bug friends, irritate teachers, forget my age, siblings make fun"
"Hey guys, I'm doing well. I take 60mg prozac and it works like a charm. Depression is part of who I am though and I don't want to forget that. When I drink, I can release those inner thoughts. Obviously this is unhealthy, but it just feels so good to cry. Usually it's my dad that I always think about. When he was at hospice, my mom took a picture of us playing our last chess game. http://i.imgur.com/SLBYwJC.jpg?1 I thought the picture was genuinely a powerful picture. I posted it on reddit and will never forget what it feels like to see a stranger wishing me well. 

I deleted the post cause I was a fucking liar. I talked as if I was staying strong for him. I was in a psychiatric  facility twice when he was dying. I couldn't handle it. I wasn't even close to him but God did it fucking hurt knowing he was leaving me. 

I remember him struggling to walk. He came in my room and told me to get my shit together. I didn't want to hear a walking corpse telling me how to live my life. I told him, ""I can't wait until you fucking die."" What i said to him haunts me every fucking day. He called the cops on me and I was admitted.

I start my paramedic class today. I don't want to stop there. I want to be a doctor like my dad. He's literally everything I aspire to be. I wish I could let him know how much I look up to him now. Sadly, it's what I said to him when I was admitted that I remember. 

I just really wanted to vent. I know we all got to the point we're at in a different way, But we're all fighting the same condition. There's a reason you guys are still here. You want to fight this shitty fight. It's not cause you're to scared to die. You think fear would prevent you from escaping? Fuck no! I love all you guys who fight this hellish condition. Keep it up! I believe in all of you! Thanks for reading. Sorry if this looks like shit, alcohol.",4,"prozac 60 mg,depression, dad dying,  want to be a psychiatrist like father,just want to vent"
"I'm sorry if this seems to be a ramble, but I need to get this out. I've been reading this sub for a while, but made a new account to comment. Sometimes I find it helpful to get everything out, and I don't have anyone left to get things out to who won't try and pity me. 

Depression runs in my family, but I'm probably using that as a crutch or an excuse. I think I'm depressed.

I go through stages of downs and (sort of) ups, though those usually manifest themselves as drives to fix the problems in my life - while never working out and making the situation worse.

Today my girlfriend called me selfish. Truth is, it's her birthday tomorrow and I haven't gotten her anything. She knows this, I haven't even gotten her a card. The reason is, I have a lot of personal debt - we both do. I spent my last Â£2 on a sandwich yesterday so that I could eat, and now I have to hope that the rest of the month ""works out"" somehow. It's 13 days until pay day.

I don't have a bad paid job, but circumstances this Christmas left me short for cash - I usually run out a few days before pay day not two weeks.

She knows about my debt, some of it's hers, but I she doesn't seem to get it, how bad it is.

I used to hurt myself. That was a long while ago, and I couldn't do it today for fear of actually having to explain myself. So there's no risk there. I'm just ready to...I don't even know. I'm broken. Help.

"A lot of really crappy things happened to me starting around this time last year, but I still felt alright because I had my friends, my band, &amp; especially a really great boyfriend. I have never felt as happy to be alive as when I was with him. But my band broke up, I fought with my best friend &amp; we don't talk any more, I lost more &amp; more friends, then eventually found myself single. I can't think of anything I've done to deserve losing everyone like this &amp; no one will tell me why it all happened. So now I have no confidence. I constantly wonder if I'm a good person because I don't understand why this happened if I am good. I'm afraid to make new friends because I don't think anyone will like me or that the new friends would eventually leave me, too. Probably also without an explanation. I also can't seem to get booked for any shows (playing music). I've struggled with depression &amp; anxiety my whole life, but never like this. I don't know what to do. I don't want to burden what few people I can still call friends with this because I want them to be happy &amp; I think it would just drag them down. Not to mention that I don't really trust anyone anymore. Just feeling so discouraged &amp; lost &amp; trapped.",4,"band  broke up, fought with best friend, dont deserve losing everyone, afraid to make new friends,new friends will leave me, dont want to burden people"
"So girl I like is very flirty when she's drunk. Actually that's the reason we're not together. She knows that it hurts me and she doesn't wants that. Recently she found someone and thought he was the one, even started to avoid me I'm guessing cuz she didn't want to hurt me. Well he didn't last and was only using her and we started talking again. 

Last weekend we went out with some friends she got drunk and flirted with some random guy again which it didn't affect me much. When he left she flirted with one of my friends. That actually affected me. The weird part is that she wanted to dance with me but only in private but she has no problem dancing with some guy or even friends.

I don't know what that means. Damn it girls are complicated. She keeps treating me different idk if that's good or not. She won't text me but gets offended if I don't text her for long periods. Is she playing with me? Wth is going on? 

Thanks for reading this long. It sucks being me right now. I've become so confuse and insecure just from one girl.

"I'm sitting here just reading all your guy's and girl's posts feeling like all you are. Let me just share whats going on in my life for a moment...

I'm 25 living with one of my grandparents taking care of her because she's old and can't get around. I love her to death and would do anything for her, but I would never tell her any of this because I feel like I need to shoulder everything. She is battling her own grief due to the loss of her closest sister and sister-in law. It was two weeks ago when one of my aunts past away (grandmas sister-in-law) and four months who I was closest (and my grandmas sister) with, who was my whole world. The hole in my heart just keeps getting bigger and I don't know how to stop it. She use to be my compass and now I feel completely lost without her. I also took care of her for about the last eight months of her life and felt like it just went by so quickly. I traveled with her when I was younger and had so many memories... now knowing shes gone I can't help but cry whenever something that reminds me of her pops up in my head.

I also got out of a six year relationship about two years ago which was horrible and I have a lot of scars (emotional) that I still haven't shaken off. I've been battling with loneliness and depression for a long time now. We would constantly fight towards the end of our relationship, but there was a time she showed me what it was like to have a real connection with someone. I pursued one or two other women after the one, but they never were looking for anything serious. I have friends who complain about their girlfriends/boyfriends and I just sit their sometimes thinking to myself...at least you have someone. I would give anything I feel to have a connection with anyone now a days, I feel like when it comes to being by myself I go into a dark corner in to my mind I can never escape. Almost feels like I'm sinking into a giant ocean and I can see the light slowly fading away and this huge amount of pressure keeps crushing me. 

I have a few friends and a lot of family members, and their company is like a drug that I try to cling on to. Two of my friends are kind of close, but they have their own lives and we don't see each other often. Most of my other friends are gone in other schools far away. My family also is kind of disconnected. When we get together it can be amazing, but their something inside myself that clicks and I hide my depression with them. They always can have a blast with each other but I feel so disassociated with them I don't feel like I belong. When it comes to parting ways I know what comes next when I'm by myself. I've told one of my relatives once, but they couldn't understand what I was going through. I've told my mom also, but she just doesn't quite know exactly what I'm feeling. She tries, but it just hurts me knowing I'm misunderstood. My friends wouldn't understand so I never tell them. 

I try to keep myself busy by going to school, reading, video games, leaving but the escape is only brief. I can't find a permanent cure for what I'm feeling. I just find myself laying in bed most of the time....trying to battle myself and never winning. Its been a few years...and I'm still depressed. I know this may not be intense as some of your guys's battles but thanks for reading if you got down this far.",4,"living with grandmother to care, lost two aunts, got out of a six year old relationship, batteling with lonliness and depression"
