"It feels like a vicious cycle. Im not allowed to leave my room until my HW's done (with the exception of eating meals). And because I cant focus, I don't get my work done. So I stay in my room like 80% of the time. The inablity to do anything stresses me out and makes me depressed. And because Im depressed, I cant focus on my work. So the work just piles up and up while I sit in my room, unable to get anything done.

I try and try to get my work done, and I know I can do it, *but it just doesnt happen*. It makes me feel like a big screwup compared to my sister, who when she was my age, almost always got grades above a B.

So, in the past year i've had 3 jobs. In the beginning of 2016, i worked 2 jobs and ended up just not showing up at both due to some personal reasons with my ex around May/June. I didn't get another job until September. So here i am, only working there a few months, and this is the second time i've done a no call no show within 3 weeks. I can't get myself to get out of bed. I just turned 19. I had to have my mom call off for me the other day because i was having a mental breakdown. The jobs i have are not even stressful, but i'm so terrified to actually CALL and talk to a manager and tell them i can't come in, and it's not like being depressed is a work excuse. I go to school full time as well. I technically don't HAVE to work, but i feel useless if i don't. I guess the point of this post is, does anyone have any advice on how to keep a job with depression? Or have any recommendations on jobs? I take medication, so there's nothing else to really help. I'm actually a really hard worker when i don't hit my lows, which is like every few weeks..",2,"done a no call show second time in a row, advice o how to keep job with depression"

"So, I've been trying to work on a research paper since October, and everything I came up with, my professor turned down.

My professor knows I work two jobs, commute an hour to school everyday and an hour home, and suffer from bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety. On top of this, I was taking four other classes that were just as demanding.

"I swore 2016 wouldn't be another 2015 and then it all fell apart. I got incredibly depressed around March and suffered a breakdown and dropped out of school. 

I haven't finished a semester of college since December 2013 even though I've enrolled in classes several times since. I had a couple opportunities to get a job but in my usual fashion I totally blew it (caught the flu when I was supposed to go in for an interview).

I'm 21 and am doing nothing with my life. I know I'm young but at this rate I'll just be living with my mom until I die. I don't know how to fix this. This is the worst.

"(This is a comment I posted yesterday that kind of explains my life right now and I was hoping maybe if I post it here I can just talk to someone about it.)

I just want my life to feel worth living honestly. 

I'm embarrassed by my body so I'm trying to gain weight and move my 150lbs to 180lbs to gain a little bit REAL confidence so I dont have to fake it all the time. I've got a healthy diet and workout routine going, but until I'm at my desired weight I just feel weak and unattractive all the time.

I just graduated highschool early 2016 and have decided to not go to college. It was four years worth of time in making that choice and weighing my options, now I made the choice and am wondering if I chose wrong. My business is going no where and I am running low on the little funds I have left. I can see my parents empathy for the unemployed graduate is starting to run a little thin too.

On average I wake up depressed 5/7 days of the week and go to sleep every single night wondering where my life is going and how I can manage to reach my goals and dreams. Happiness comes and goes, but 9 times out of 10 I'm just putting on a show. Nothing I'm not familiar with though. That's what my whole fucking life has been. A damn show. Now I'm not saying I've had it bad. My family is kind and loving. And I grew up relatively middle class. What I am saying is that as soon as I started highschool my life became fake. I put on this character so people will think I'm okay when I'm really not. 

I lie to my family and tell them that everything is going fine and that ""Business is great! I'm not depressed at all! Wow yesterday was so much fun sitting at home all alone with no one to talk to and only my thoughts to remind me of how much of a failure I've been recently!"" I'm too damn proud to admit that I have no clue what I'm doing and the last thing I want them to do is worry. Not like it matters anyways. My dad can see my bank account slowly dropping day by day. I tell him I have funds in my paypal, but I'm not sure if he believes that anymore.

Everyone knows I'm failing at life right now too. Whenever someone asks about my job my parents and friends never say that I'm a photographer, or a video editor, or a writer, or a musician. It's always ""well he's just taking some time off right now."" Or ""yeah he's unemployed."" Or ""He doesn't really do anything."" Or worst of all ""Oh he's just having fun messing around with a little photography."" Really? Messing around? So practicing my craft for 6 years and now trying to run a business is just messing around. Well shit I guess they're right. It's not like I'm making any damn money doing this anyways. Today I officially shut it down. Everyone seems to think that all it is is a hobby so maybe that's how I should keep it. I just applied for a few shitty, monotonous 9-5s, the things I told myself I would never do and I feel like I sold out all my values. I've given up everything I stand for and I've given up on myself. I highly doubt I'll even get the jobs anyways. No one wants to hire someone with past experience as ""summer lifeguard"" and ""photographer"".

Stress eats away at my health constantly. If depression isnt causing me to oversleep and then not even feel restes than stress is keeping me awake. I'm eighteen fucking years old. Eighteen. You wanna know what my blood pressure was on the last time I checked? 141/90. I eat relatively healthy, and try to exercise daily and my blood pressure is 141/90.

And don't get me started on dating. Oh damn am I fucked up. Aside from the fact that I have these unrealistic standards for girls I can't even get in a relationship. I've been in four relationships in my life so far right? Girl #1 broke up with me (she ended up figuring out she was a lesbian so kudos to her and no hard feelings on this one). #2 three months, cheated. #3 seven months, cheated. Took her back, cheated again. #4 same shit as #3. I went to one highschool dance. My senior prom. The minute we walked in she said bye and walked off with some other dude to dance. Now I've got these trust issues and on top of that I only chase unhealthy relationships. I get so close to a relationship with someone good then just lose interest because now it's not a chase anymore. What the hell is wrong with me?!

I thought that I could prove people wrong. I thought that maybe they weren't right. Maybe I'm not some fucking loser with no talents. Maybe my dreams aren't stupid and unachievable. Maybe once I graduate, I can show everyone that doubted me that I actually can do it and prove to everyone that following your dreams is an option! Well maybe in reality, that's just something you tell the stupid little kid who thinks he can be whatever he wants so he'll just shut up and leave you alone. 

I'm tired of people lying to me and saying ""You can do it! Don't give up! Dreams do come true!"" I've been putting in the work and got shit. Countless days and nights of no sleep trying to find that next job or making that project perfect. Dreams are just that. Fucking dreams, and that's where they need to stay. The only reason people think they can do anything is because they see a select few people that happened to be at the right place at the right time for a payoff. It doesn't matter if you've worked your ass off or if you just started yesterday, because in the end, all that matters is if you were lucky enough to roll the dice on the time they decided to land in your favor.

Everyday I wake up, put on this 'mask' and make people think I'm happy so that maybe they can trick me into thinking I'm happy too. The problem is now, is that it's not working anymore.

To top it all off, I don't feel entitled or like I'm allowed to feel depressed. I'm not homeless, not raised in a bad situation, I'm white in America. I feel like if I tell anyone about this all I'm gonna get is a ""get over it"" kind of response.",2,"graduated high school, did not go to college, started with business, wonedring if imade worng choices, parents emapthy for unemployed graduate,consider photograpgy craft is a waste"
"The past two years have taught me never to hope. Hope is a very big mistake to be making. Every single time I have hoped for the best, or looked forward to the future, it has been taken away without any real reasons and denied. This is not me. I used to love waking up in the morning and I used to love going to school, going home, going to bed. I loved EVERYTHING because I was looking forward to everything. Now what? Days are a fucking blur and all I'm thinking about is the next time I'll be suffering, whether it be dealing with terrible bosses at an underpaid, over stressful job, dealing with angry people, or worrying about not doing the shit I should be.

"Hello. So I would like to preface this by saying that I have not been formally diagnosed with depression, but I figured this subreddit would be the best place to seek advice nevertheless. I hope you don't mind me. 

For a while now I have not been able find the motivation to do much of anything. When I have a break from school I mindlessly click through useless videos on Youtube or various useless articles. Virtually nothing holds my attention. I can't get through an episode of a tv show without reading something else. I can't read through interesting articles, I can't finish any books, I can't draw, I can't do any research or even clean my room. Essentially, I can't accomplish anything unless it pertains to a greater purpose than simply enjoyment, or if I have made myself accountable to someone else, and even then I have trouble finishing tasks. It was honestly difficult for me to get out of bed and shower for the past couple of days. I am on winter break currently. 

What makes me the most afraid is that I haven't been thinking-- especially thinking creatively. If I have a new idea to ponder, I never pursue it. I used to constantly be thinking of new art projects and writing prompts, even though they never came to fruition. In school, I am ridiculously bored. I am lucky if I pay attention for ten minutes straight in any of my classes. My grades are fine, however. 

Could I have some advice, please? I am saddest about my lack of curiosity. Even when there was nothing interesting to do, I always had my imagination, and now I am bored with my own mind. Anything you can say to help would be greatly appreciated.

"This might end up sounding like a bunch of rambling but I am tired and have to get this off my chest to someone else. 

The last few months have been really rough. Between a very serious likelihood that I am going to have to drop out of grad school because of a stupid error on my part, money issues, and just struggling with Seasonal Affect Disorder, this is the lowest I have ever been. . 

Getting the ""blues"" during the winter time for me is normal and I usually don't say anything to anyone but this year has been so so bad. Up until now, I haven't seriously felt the ""Things would be better without me"" feeling before and it scared the shit out of. I was driving in car and I had a very real moment of not wanting to hit the brakes as I pulled up to the stop sign.. I am still scared about how bad I was feeling and could feel again. Honestly, on top of the fear and sadness, I feel a lot of shame for being so bummed out and having a thought like that. 

I struggled with whether or not to tell anyone. I was really ashamed with how I felt. I have a degree in Psych and I work in Mental Health so I have given the ""who to talk to/numbers to call"" speech more times than I can count but I was/am scared to admit that I might need it. It took me a couple of days but I did end up telling my boyfriend. I don't think that I can talk to my parents/family about how I am feeling yet. .Just a different type of relationship with them but I told him. It was incredibly scary and I don't think I have ever felt more ashamed/scared to say something in my life. I couldn't outright say that I wanted to die in that moment but I told him how I felt and he seemed to understand. He made sure to do the good boyfriend/person thing. . Was very understanding/supportive but made sure that I knew I needed to tell him or someone if I was that sad or felt that way again. 

I am not saying that saying something made the depression any less or easier but i can say that telling him was a lot more freeing than I thought. I know that he has my back and is watching to catch me if I fall back into feeling like I wanted to hurt myself or something like that. I am glad I did it.

"Okay so this is extremely embarrassing and I have been called everything under the sun from lazy to useless, I have been out of full time employment since 2013 with only one seasonal summer job as a parts driver for a helicopter company last summer. 

In my previous work place which was known as a starter company for the trade I was trying to get into I worked myself into sickness and was bullied by grown ass men into depression. This all culminated into a bad back injury from lifting a 12x12 with a coworker when the coworker slipped and I tried to compensate which made me slip a disc. I was bullied into not filling for workers comp and put on light duty for 2 weeks, this all happened around the time I was finally supposed to get my apprenticeship. Instead I was laid off, to which no one told me until I drove the hour to work but everyone seemed to know the day before. 

So this is the embarrassing part, I had a mental breakdown in my truck then drove home crying. I was so frustrated so angry. I should have gone then and there to the competitor in town and applied for a job, but I couldn't bring myself to so I took a few days for myself and started applying for more entry level trade jobs. Now if you haven't been in or tried to get into a trade, most of the time the only way your going to even get a interview is if you know someone who works for the company. Which unfortunately I was 20 at the time and just starting out, so of course I didn't know anyone in the trade. And then whole oil glut/oligarchy thing happened which made it even harder. 

So I did that for a year, had to move back with my parents, my parents gave me shit when I tried to sell my truck  and they took on the payments. I shouldn't have let them I know, it made me feel so shitty and it still does. So then summer hits and my best friends family owns a helicopter company and this was a big fire year in my province, so he asked me if I could give him a hand so I did. I wish I could still work for them, I didn't think people could be so nice at a workplace. Then summer ended and  they didn't need me anymore, so I went back to looking. Then last winter I slipped and slipped my disc again only this time was much worse and I was laid up for 6 months doing pt, getting injections and seeing a chiropractor. 

Now I've been out of work with almost nothing to show for my time for so long and I have nothing to put on my resume. I did do a few courses to try and get something but that didn't pan out. I have my h2s, csts, first aid and forklift and zoomboom tickets. I just want to live, not exist. I need work, I've tried applying for everything under the sun the past few months. Every day gets harder and harder at this point I think I should just kill myself to relieve my parents of a financial burden , and a embarrassment. I feel like such a failure, I tried my hardest I really did I swear I'm not lazy I'm trying, please I just want to be a person again. 

If you read all that, thank your for taking the time to it really means a lot to me. It's hard for me to type this out and even harder for me to hit the post button. Sorry for getting pretty emotional towards the end and also for any grammatical errors English is my second language.

This nothingness has grown increasingly pervasive in my life.

I want to go to college but feel it is not in my best interest at the moment. I want to take a year off and work but am worried a year might turn into a lifetime of dead-end jobs and complacency. I want sometimes to pass my house in my Jeep and keep driving. But what would that solve?

I guess what I'm getting at is that I have no direction at the moment and nothing is calling me particularly loudly. I don't know where to go or what to do. I often find my eyes welling up and my fingers tapping my quivering leg with a sense of urgency, but alas I am still sitting. This yearning to do, to live, to experience coupled with my indistinct, unguided future, has birthed an uneasiness, a tension, that I haven't been able to relieve.

"Good day everyone!

I have decided to write my story here, since it seems that there might be some people here who might relate to me and maybe give insight.

TLDR: I am a 25 year old male who is enjoying his life, but constantly feels that he is doing more negative than positive things day-to-day in his life.

So going back to the story. As said above in the TLDR i have this weird feeling that i am doing more negative things in my life than positive things day-to-day and i can't seem to shake it off. Let me clarify that feeling, every day when i wake up i feel i am doing more things I DON'T WANT TO DO and LESS THINGS I WANT TO DO! No i am not depressed (at least i think i am not), no i am not sad, but this feeling makes me empty. It all started when i went to college for Bachelors degree. Before that everything seemed fine and i was doing more positive things in life than negative ones. My Bachelors degree went smoothly, i got the degree, i got a decent job (above average pay where i live), i wen't on to Masters degree and from the get go (starting from Bachelors degree) i have this urgency, that i do more things i don't want to do day-to-day and i get no pleasure from it.

Let me bring you an example. I wake up, i go to work. This part i enjoy. Now everything falls apart after work. I have to do this Masters degree and i feel like this is a complete and utter chore to do. Although everyone expect that i must finish this, so i have this pressure on me, that i have to finish this and i want to, but i feel like i am a prison in my own jail. I would gladly workout or hangout with friends, but i can't because from the morning to evening i am at work and after evening till night (sometimes even to 02:00 or 03:00) i do school stuff. I have already burned out once before (where i failed hard on some assignments) and i decided to take less workload. Still i feel like i am always overwhelmed and i can't seem to find free time to be who i want to be, but rather i feel like i have to complete these chores.

Then there is this another thing. I don't get enough respect from others although when problems arise, everyone are running to me for help. For an example, i am an engineer and the university where i am is expanding in the field where i work. I offered my help for anything the answer was ""You should get more experience before offering help"" from the director. After that i was quite confused, because i have been working on my speciality for over 3 years, i have a Bachelors degree, i am looking forward for my Masters degree and when i offer a friendly helping hand i get scolded for no apparent reason. Also when they need some materials from the workplace i work for, then everyone are running for me to ask help.

This helping is expanding to other things as well in life. When my friends are in need of help (lending money or anything else) then everyone are running to me, but i get no credit for it. For one friend i helped him to get a great job opening through my connections and then he was ""Yeah man, thanks for helping me, i will throw you a party"" of course this party never happened and i never got a thanks for it, rather that just thank you and goodbye.

Also at workplace i often get the same ""Disrespect"" treatment from older engineers (since i am a young guy) then i also provide new ideas, new innovative approaches and i seem to never get any respect for it. I have brought new ideas which have improved some systems and then its like ""Well its obvious thanks for the help"", but sometimes i get scolded for no apparent reason like the same from the director. Is this like some kind of an age thing? I don't understand or am i just an idiot.

But the main thing although is this school thing, that some of my classmates who are not even working in their speciality full-time are going more to school and getting more praises like scholarships, director is happy with them and me who is working as a full-time engineer, gets scolded, gets said like ""Get more experience"" although others who have never worked in their speciality. Is this like some kind of an academid circle-jerk they are doing to me? No i am not a fricking loser loner nerd guy, i am quite a self confident guy, but this just makes me so angry that i provide the university materials and experience from my workplace and i get scolded for working and not being full-time academic student? How does this even be logical?

Oeh there are many more things which i could write, but i don't want to drag this out if anyone has any questions or wants to discuss, i would happily open up more.

Thank you,
I just wanted to write this out!",2,"feeling more negative than positive, doing masters ,get no pleasure,"

I wanted to give my old job a two-weeks notice but I couldn't because the new job couldn't give me a proper state date then they finally told me it would be the following Monday which was three days later. It sucked but I had to tell my boss that I had to quit after the Saturday before. He knew that I was getting a new job so I didn't just spring this on him. I hated telling him I had to start on Monday.

Monday rolls around and the new job tells me they don't need me until a week later. I didn't have my old job to go back to since they had already taken me out of the system. So yay, I was screwed out of a weeks pay. 

I finally did get to work the following week. Now, I don't have a car of my own. New job said they would work with me and either pick me up from my home or have me walk a few blocks to be picked up. Since November I have only worked a total of two weeks. I don't have a car to just drive around and look for jobs nor do I have a friend that can drive me around (I don't even know what a friend is anymore). 

New job hasn't had any work for me for the past two weeks and they are saying they are keeping us till the 13th. I have a phone bill I have to pay in a few weeks plus give my roommate rent. He also works for new job and is also having a hard time as well since he has no car.

I simply do not have the money to buy a car or even a down payment. I wish I knew what to do or where to go. I can't help but once again think about the life I had before last June. I had a family, a car and a wife. I still have a bit of resentment towards her because when she left me she want to her parents and they immediately helped her get a car. We lost our old car because we were behind on payments and I was borrowing a car from a friend of her family until she left then they guy suddenly needed it back...

I'm just super worried about everything. I don't have a single way out of this house. I feel like this is my prison. I'm here with roommates who all they want to do is get high (I have no problems with smoking by the way) and play video games. I enjoy gaming myself, but I don't want that to just be my life. I hate it here. I wish I knew of something to do or where to go. I wish a someone would talk to me or listen. I wish someone was concerned about my life. I miss having friends who cared. I just...I hate this. I hate all of it.",2,"switch job abruptly, dont have a car, new job hasnt had any work for me past two weeks, want new car badly, no real friends"
"I've hated school all my life, but I did my best to get good grades and finish because I thought I could finally be free once I graduate. After graduating, I thought life would finally start being fun and enjoyable, I had worked so hard to finally be over with it and I was full of dreams and motivation. Fast forward 2 years later, I tried everything I could, from starting my own business to working at a restaurant, working in software development job (I graduated in Computer Science), working as a guide, acting, and every time it's the same, I end up hating my job and my life and quit. At this point I feel like I've lost all my motivation to do anything, I don't know what I want to do and no matter how much I look for a passion I can't find one. I'm currently employed and I hate my job, just thinking about it makes me want to kill myself. Everybody thinks I'm doing great because I go to the gym, learn foreign languages, play music, got good grades at school, but work makes me so fucking depressed that all I can think of is ending everything. I love to learn languages but that doesn't make any money, translation makes money but I hate it and want to kill myself just thinking about it. I love watching anime, listening to music, playing music, eating good food, seeing a nice scenery, but none of that makes money, and with no money I'm homeless, and I'd rather die than be homeless, but working makes me want to kill myself. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on how you look at it, I have a good family who I most definitely do not want to harm and thus suicide is absolutely out of the question, I could never forgive myself if I went through with it. So here I am, hating my life and wanting to kill myself every day but unable to do so because I do not want to cause harm to my family. It's like I'm in jail although I'm perfectly healthy (at least physically) and free (in theory). I just wish I was never born, I wouldn't be in this situation and everything would be so much easier. It seems like no matter which direction I step in, it sucks. So then I look towards suicide, but even that sucks. I wish I would just pass out and wake up from this shitty nightmare.",2,"hated school and college, working as a guide, acting , every time end up hating my job, wish I were never born, life sucks"

"So back in 2015 I had this girlfriend, my first one, long story short we broke up and I got major depression, suicidal thoughts, self harm(cutting, snapping, punching) for about a year. Luckily by mid 2016 I managed to get out of it but after the holidays I found out after I left year 11 and went onto a new sixth form this girl, my ex, is now at the same sixth form/ college as me and this is completely screwing me up, she told all her friends about all the stupid shit I said to her that I would've preferred to keep private, which in turn means they are all judging me, apparently they are calling me names and I'm basically being bullied. 
Not only that but there are these people in my computing class who started out being my friends but slowly I think they are just starting to bully me too, there was this picture I uploaded 2 years ago to my Instagram of me in a onesie that they keep teasing me about, they even went so far as to print it off and put it in my pocket so as to piss my off when I find it. 
I really don't want to go back to college as I don't want to face all of this again, i really think it's going to break me and pull me back to cutting and sucical thoughts, even though the thoughts have already started again.

I despise doing work and even though I'm pretty good at school (I'm a freshman in high school) I know I need to improve next year (first year at my school grades don't matter).  This is because I absolutely must get into Harvard.  All my siblings and both of my parents went there, and I would be a complete fuckup and embarassment if I didn't.  Perhaps it's irrational but it would be crushing to me, I might kill myself.  I have no friends at school, most people think I'm creepy (at the beginning I tried really hard to get a girlfriend and it backfired), overly pushy, annoying, etc.  My siblings, who I'm very close with, are rarely home, and I'm sort of the family problem child (they're all virtually perfect.)  My parents are usually good but they put me under a lot of pressure.  My life should feel good but I fucking hate it and I don't know how to handle 3 and a half more years of this with no friends, little sleep due to homework, boredom and stress. Oh and I'm also somewhat addicted to videogames, they're all I do in my free time because I have no friends or physical talent (I also hate sports), and sometimes even cut into my homework time which is why I'm getting B+s instead of A's which I NEED to get.

 Just got back the results after retaking a test and scored another F. And so I am formally announcing giving up on my education and getting a low-entry job and just being content with that for the rest of my life.

Somedays just seem to pass on autopilot, I don't even notice the day has passed until I look outside and see it's already dark out.

So I'm back to jobseeking once again, and experiencing incredible anxiety about telling my family about my failure, they've been really supportive of me ""taking life into my own hands"" and striving to do better with my education. Truth be told it was a half-assed attempt and I barely studied at all. Spent my time playing games or wallowing in self pity most of the time.

Yesterday I googled something that vaguely described how I felt and landed on [this page](http://www.getesteem.com/lse-symptoms/symptom-details.html) and it resonated so hard with me I broke down into tears. I feel like a mess.

Everything is just really overwhelming right now.

"Hello, this is my first post here. Sorry if it breaks any of the rules. I am an 18 yr old male in my freshman year of college. I'm not very smart and I have to take English 48 in the community college I go to since I failed Freshman English twice, had to retake Sophomore English and struggled through all my other English classes.

"Hi everyone,
I've been lurking on this reddit for a couple of months now, on and off, depending on my mood. It's always been uplifting to read the responses to the posts.

The context of my problem is that I'll be looking for an internship in April of this year (my very first job), and I'm unsure if I can match up to the competition and impress a potential employer.

However, that isn't what I wanted help with. My problem is that when I think about my prospects, I have attacks of what I'm pretty sure is called ""anticipatory"" anxiety, ranging from vague feelings of discomfort to hyperventilating panic attacks, almost always followed by a period of intense depressed lethargy where I am unable to do anything but stare at the ceiling and feel shitty about myself. This can last for anytime between 2-3 hours to a whole day.

Needless to say, this is seriously hampering my productivity, and I'd like to ask about the r/depression community if they've ever experienced anything similar and what they've done to avoid or subdue these feelings of hopelessness and anxiety.

Thanks in advance!

"Moving back home isn't an option. I won't be able to get and hold a job for much the same reason I can't graduate - an inability to be among others for any notable amount of time. I had hoped to get a stay at home job upon graduating, but without a degree that possibility is closed to me.

I have roughly $20k to my name and my expenses are minimal. All I want is to keep to myself and not constantly worry about food and shelter, but I know nothing about essentials such as cooking or apartment searching.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5jquj6/i_failed_another_college_class_and_i_dont_know/

But basically I am 23 years old and a computer science major and I have recently just failed another semester of college and told my mother about it. She was disappointed in me and really expressed her disappointment in me.

Whenever I don't distract myself with video games or watching tv I feel miserable about my life and reflect about how much of a failure I think I am. I usually get thoughts about what I would've done differently if I could turn back time and get a sort of existential crisis. 

Sometimes I feel motivated in the morning to improve my life and that I would build up on my resume by trying to learn a new programming language or by working on an app or some coding project I can put on my portfolio but whenever I get stuck I end up losing my will to continue and go back to having my existential crisis.

I have tried following a daily schedule and deleting the games I play on my computer but I end up still distracting myself with other things.

Is there a way to just power through life? I keep telling myself that life gets better and that in the future I'll get married and start my own family and will be happy. But whenever I take some time to think about it I don't really know if its worth it. 

Thanks for reading.",2,"failed another semester, mother disappointed in me, distract self with video games, lack of motivation, existential crisis"

"I have just moved in with my gf in December, graduated a year ago and have begun working in a company. The company's a successful growth company.

I have liked to work there, but there are some problems. I had a conversation with my bosses about my performance, and they said that they're not sure if I will get to continue there after the test period.

I don't mind criticism, I know I can do better, but f.ex. right now I've been in a flu for about 3 weeks, and my boss has suggested that I shouldn't have a day off even though I would feel like it.

Everything about this situation makes me feel pressurised, and I wake up every morning feeling reluctant to go to work. It's not nice to feel like every day matters at work, when normal routines are starting to feel like effort.

When I get home from work, I usually just slob on the couch and watch comedies or other funny videos to feel better. I sleep quite ok, could do with a few more hours.

I'm grateful to have gotten an opportunity to work in such a successful company. After all, in these times, even getting work is not certain.

I have been depressed before. At that time, I was just 18 and trying to figure out what the hell was I doing. Ended up quitting my job then.
