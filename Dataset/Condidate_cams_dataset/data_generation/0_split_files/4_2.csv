"Hiya redditors of r/depression, as a person who suffers from depression and social anxiety, I know what itâs like to feel lonely, particularly on big holidays like these.

"Hi... I'm 19 y.o., today around 23:00 I had a big fight with my mother, I made joke about her loud chewing and she flipped out...I walked away to my room and had anxiety attack while I listened to her crying in  another room.... At midnight when we drinked champagne she didn't even looked me in the eye... Now I'm sitting in  my room crying and listening how she wants to throw me out of the house, how she is screaming at my father... I just see one way out... I did nothing wrong, I didn't ment it wrong... I don't understand how it could turn into this... So I guess happy new year... I hope it's gonna be the last one....

"17 years old here.
Tl;dr: Have been ""clean"" of depression for about a year, depression came back, I write a list of things i want to achieve within the next 6 months, if I fail achieving all of the things I will commit suicide and give up forever.
Having had depressions since I was a child (always hated myself, was never satisfied with myself, even had suicidal thoughts at the age of 8, being sad and lazy, having no motivation for anything). Around 14 months ago I told myself I am gonna fight this, I will not let my life be controlled by this sickness. I completely started my life all over again. I fought my porn and alcohol addictions (I live in Germany, here it is no problem for people under 16 to have access to cheap alcohol). I got rid of toxic friends, started working out (a lot), changed my diet and got more social. I even got a bit into meditation. Focusing a lot more on important things like sports, school/education. I really got back on track and thought that I had beaten my depression completely.
After some time I finally felt true happiness. I found good friends with which i had a lot of fun and which i truely love. And it went on like this for actually a lot of time.
And then it all slowly crept up on me again...
I dont know why, I dont know when exactly...
About 2 months ago I started feeling inner changes. Doing things that usually would be extremely exciting to me did not bother me anyway, when I did them I did not feel any emotions at all (for example illegally climbing up a crane for the first time in my life; i did not feel fear while doing it or relief/happiness afterwards)
In general I just recognized some kind of neutrality towards life; i did not have any real emotions anymore. It became stronger with time. 
That is just how it started, a lot of events were since then (dont want to bother you with things that are not relevant/interesting, so i keep it short) like severe injury, finding a girlfriend, stress in general. And yesterday my whole life just flipped and the depression train got a full body hit on me. My girlfriend more or less broke up with me, my best friends hate me now and my family is mad.
I never thought that I would have depressions again but well there they are: crying, self hatred, suicidal thoughts, social isolation, energylessness, bed ridden, not having eaten or drunk water for 2 days, not having washed or changed clothes for 3 days.
Well after a lot of thinking I came to a conclusion:
I will write a list of things I want to achieve until first of July 2018 (exactly half a year). If i achieve all of these things, fine. If not, I will commit suicide. And I take this dead seriously - If I cannot get my life back on track I do not see any reason in living anymore. I could do it once but it only helped temporarily. So if I cant even do it again, my life will be bullshit forever and i dont want that.
Luckily I am fucking afraid of death (which is good because that way I have never tried suicide but only had a lot of thoughts about them) so I have a lot of motivation to actually achieve all the things on the list. I DO NOT FUCKING WANT TO DIE so I really have a very good motivation, but if I fail I will overcome my fear, because I MUST die, there is no other rational option.
If anybody is interested what some of the points on my list are (i havent worked it out completely yet):
-130kg bench press as 1RM
-250kg deadlift as 1 RM (yes I am very sports focused)
- having an average grade of 1.5 or better (which is extremely good in the german school system)
- losing my virginity
- earning 1000â¬ with side jobs

These are hard goals, but with enough work I can achieve them and I will start out extremely dedicated and set a symbol. For the first week of 2018, so the next 7 days, I will close away my smart phone, not have any social interactions, working ALL day (learning a lot, reading a lot, starting meditation, working out, cooking amazing meals)
The only thing that concerns me is that propably some of my friends will not be able to accept my new strict form of living (and propably be mad that I didnt talk to them for 7 days without warning them before) but I have no problem with making sacrifices like those to earn my right of surviving.",4,"My girlfriend more or less broke up with me, my best friends hate me now, my family is mad,  toxic friends,self hatred, social isolation, energylessness, bed ridden,"
"names where changed and the grammer problems are because of a reading problem i have but try to read it to your best abilities 



I was born from a 15 year old mom and a 20 something year old rapist dad yeah starting even before my birth shit was messed up, when I was born it was april 22 2002 in berlin vermont surprisingly it was cold in april snowing even. So lets move to one of my first memories one day when me and my mom lived in a trailer park someone slammed a door and a glass painting fell and it went through my foot. Later in my life me and a step brother of mine where fighting and I fell through a glass table causing glass to go through my skull causing more pain from an early age.
 So later in my life my mom began to date a man named dan he as a cook in south carolina so when we move there I had my first experience in a long line of male role models due to the fact that I had no dad growing up or a consultant father figure so I developed a distain towards them but not till the second one. So my mom had a bad case of ptsd and probably bipolar disorder cause she would change from happy to pissed on the matter of seconds and this would often be in many of my memories.
 After one big fight between mom and dan they broke up and I was sen to live with my grandma but she left me with someone else till I was 6 when after that mom and dan got back together and I moved to live with them in florida. We lived in an apartment building and me and dan began to develop a father son relationship he was nice to me and taught me how to read better and build with legos and was overall an awesome guy ( at least what I can remember) but all good things must come to an end around age 9 mom and  dan broke up and me and mom moved to vermont once again. 
During the time we are we moved back me and mom lived with friends and family for a short amount of time till we became homeless for a good amount of time during the winter. And it had a major effect on me academically and emotionally. I began to develop a reading disorder and Oppositional defiant disorder which caused me to not to develop any kinds of friendship and social ties only loneliness it got to a point where the other kids saw me a scary and unstable and the school thought it was a good idea to lock me in a small room alone with only a desk and a chair and a packet of work for 7 hours a day. I became isolated and depressed at 11 at 11 years old I began to think I was not deserving to live on this world. But something around this time changed in me the boy who once saw the world ash happy and okay had changed in to a semi sociathinc ball of emotions of sadness and anger to a point where life was bland and grey.
I felt alone completely and in honestly around this time my reading disability went away but my o.c.d went away but I still was depressed and sad.mom was busy but always made time to give me affection and strict guidelines and I wished I could feel the joy of my adolescence in these times but no it was nothing but dark.
 on day after a teacher yelled at me for my different actions in the school compared to the other children I decided to act the way they wanted me to be I smiled and laughed and spoked and behaved but it was just a mask I wore so the real me would die alone in his ball of emotions, but he didn't after a solid year of wearing a mask of happy I began to convince the other people around me that I had changed  and it worked I was let out of the room and made friends with the other kids, and it almost fooled me into thinking I was happy but no I could tell that no matter how I acted I can't hide how I felt inside. Later in my life I moved to ca with my mom and her new bf and he was a grade a asshole, he made me actually try to commit suicide and my mom finally found out when I decided to jump 3 stories of a balcony and she stopped me. But steve had done the one thing no other father figure had done he got my mom pregnant with my little sister bella and that is the one good thing he ever did in my eyes cause that baby was wonderful funny and overall an awesome addition to the family but all good things must come to an end.
Steve one night found a will I wrote cause I was scared he would hurt me and he locked me up in a padded room for 2 days and that cause my depression and loneliness to come back and fucked me over . when I got home he beat the shit out of me till I started to bleed from my skin, and with that my mom gave me a gift that I will never forget âdo you want to go live with your nana, or stay here with meâ and I love my mom I truly do because she is the one coinsastant thing in my life but I couldn't stay here with that jackass and I left so much out of the story because I don't have the time and the focus to recount the entire story but on that day I took 3 planes here and begun to live with my grandma. Do I regret it sometimes but overall I am happy and semi sad at times but I am okay here

So now Iâm just in the basement, wanting to cry and burst into tears but just doesnât seem to want to happen. I feel so alone, Iâve tried to keep my mind clear by playing video games, but it doesnât seem to work. Iâm running out of options. I donât know what to do. I just need somebody to hug me and tell me everything is going to be alright. I feel so helpless right now...

"But not because I was sad but because I was so happy. Iâm spending some days with friends in a bigger city and we were planning on going to a prayer at 11 pm and then to a party. But I am crazily scared of fireworks (childhood trauma here you go) so I decided last minute to stay at our accommodation. A few minutes later 3 friends decided to come back because they were worried and didnât want me to spend New Yearâs Eve alone. I resisted in the beginning but they made theyâre decision and stayed with me. We had a small prayer and Christmas cookies and just spend some beautiful hours together. Afterwards they said it was the most beautiful New Yearâs Eve theyâve ever had and same applies to me because Iâm used to spending it alone and having a breakdown. I am just so happy and itâs unbelievable for me someone actually cared about me. 

However my ex roommate texted me as well how much she enjoyed being my roommate and how much I taught her. 

These things are so important for me right now because I realized Iâm really deep in my depression again and struggling with my current situation. I didnât think I meant anything to anyone and I was just being there but all of this showed me that there are people that care. 

And there are also people out there that care about you. You might not think they do or find it completely unbelievable but there are people that care and that would miss you if youâd just be gone. Take care. ",4,"scared of fireworks,childhood trauma"

"Hey everyone. Some context, I'm 16, sophomore, this all happened through my mid freshmen and mid sophomore year. I have pretty bad depression but got medication about maybe two months ago.

My once best friend lives over 7,000 miles away from me. She lives in South Africa while I live in the United States, specifically in central Texas. I met her on an app called ""talklife"" where you just vented about... life! I had made a post about how I hated myself, and I was in tears when one day she messaged me. She said she would be willing to be there for me and eventually our friendship really started to grow. She trusted me really quickly.

We mostly communicated on whatsapp. One day she randomly messaged me saying she hurt herself. It broke my heart. I wish I could have been there for her in person to hug her and be there for her. But I couldn't, but I did my best to comfort her. She opened up a lot on what she's been through. Bullying, parental abuse, and at one point a boy from her school pretty much threatened to rape her and nobody would take her seriously when she talked about it.

We both came to each other whenever we were hurt. I doubt she would ever admit it but she was a little clingy to me at one point, but I soon became waaay more clingy than she ever was. I was very attached to her. Being the closest friend I have ever had and the first person I would go to when I was hurting. 

I think my clingyness to her, along with my insecurity and depression, made things start to go downhill in our friendship. The first time we had a fight was when I was having an awful day at school and I was dying to vent to her. I was holding in tears at my classes and needed to talk but she was busy and constantly going offline. I felt like she was ignoring me and I told her ""fuck you"" and blocked her. It was weird, I felt better after that. I shouldn't have, because I potentially just ruined a friendship, but I felt better just being nasty, like it got my frustration and hurt out.

I unblocked her and apologized but she was hurting. However I recorded a video of myself just talking and apologizing, and admitting how I was a dick, and she really felt way happier after seeing it and seemed back in a good mood. I was glad she wasn't holding a grudge and felt better after the video I sent her.

It may sound weird to send her a video of myself, but I think net neutrality is not a thing in South Africa, so she has some bundle she says where she can use a couple apps but is unable to call at all. It took me a while to understand.

We had a lot of arguments along our friendship. A lot of times I questioned if it was getting toxic. However whenever we explained both our sides and admitted our faults, we were on good terms again. However, I still think it was taking a toll on our friendship.

There was a point where we got into an argument about something, I don't remember exactly all the details, but here's what I remember.

So we had planned to want to visit sometime. One day I watched a documentary on South Africa over it's gangs and crimes, and I jokingly told her I changed my mind over visiting. It was a dick move to joke about but I told her I didn't mean it, and that she should calm down. She started going off on me and I kind of ignored it. She later posted something on her status with her parents hugging her and it's caption said ""abuse."" I know it seems like a joke, but she has told me about how her mom hits her and has made her cry in fear, and how she's felt suicidal because of how her mom treated her, so I wasn't sure. I told her if she needed anyone I was hear and she told me ""Uhm... it was a joke."" I know that doesn't seem rude to say, but by her standards it really is. I was pretty insulted and I started kind of going off on her.

Eventually I tried to apologize but she wouldn't respond. I called her a disease and she told me she wished me a good life but couldn't take this and blocked me, ""for good."" I messaged her through my brother, messaging her school's name. She had a uniform on her Instagram she gave me where it said her school's name in big bold letters, I didn't stalk her or anything. She unblocked me and kind of panicked, but I told her how I found her school's name. I texted her it because I learned freaking her out gets her to message people back. I said let's try to fix things but she wasn't budging. I started getting mad and feeling very hurt. I felt like if she was a real friend she would try to fix things with me, and not cut me off, especially considering how close we were. When I look back on this know, I was pretty stupid for how mean I was to her, and not realizing she was just tired of all the arguing and me hurting her.

I told her some incredibly nasty things, bringing up a lot of the things she struggled with and vented to me about, only to have me use it against her and break her down. I could tell I was getting to her, really making her hurt. I was acting like a sadist over her ""being a fake friend"" which she wasn't. Simply tired of the arguments, my temper and emotional bullying. She soon blocked me later.

I wish I realised that my reaction was so stupid. In my mind I just viewed her as being a fake friend, and never meaning any of the times she was there for me since she wouldn't want to fix things with me.

The feeling of her being a fake friend really hurt me and made me kind of crazy. I cried a lot because I felt so betrayed. I borrowed my friend's phone's to text her things like ""you should kill yourself"" and ""you just lost the only friend you had."" Just really nasty things. At one point, I made an entire account on Instagram dedicated to making fun of her. I posted dumb edits of her face and made posts going into detail why I thought she was a piece of shit. I followed a ton of her peers and got up to like 700 followers at one point. I informed her about it and she started freaking out.

A couple weeks pass. One day, a friend of her's, who was also mine too, saw one of my posts and sent it to her to maybe make her realise some of the scummy things she has been doing. I made them sound a lot worse than they really were yet not quite making it a lie. She said she wasn't going to read it and was starting to get over what I had done. My friend reminded her of the times I was there for her, and how if I was hurting I obviously meant a lot to her, and him saying that made her unblock me and forgive me. I was very skeptical but we talked things out and I deleted the account even though I still felt like she was being fake to me.

I needed to get somethings off my chest and in a voice note I told her how she had hurt me before the account was made, and I was still having trouble if I wanted to be her friend or not. She then told me that she was sorry for the hurt she caused, but then she told me the hurt she felt from what I did.

She said every day she walked into school terrified that someone would bring up the account. She would hurt herself and contemplated suicide constantly while the account was up and while I sent her those disgusting messages. She tried to force herself to be strong but all it did was push her suicidal urges down for a short time. She cried while saying all this and said she was scared to be my friend again, because she didn't want me to hurt her like that again.

It hurt so much. I started crying and really felt like shit. I explained more of the hurt I felt but also gave a deeper apology and explained more on things that had contributed to me being an asshole. She then recorded a very long voice note, I think about 9 minutes, talking about how she was sorry for making me cry and the hurt she caused before, and how she forgave me, and how she was my glad to be my friend again.

That feeling I had when we fixed all that shit was truly amazing. I felt so much better. But I also felt a lot of guilt for what I had done to her, but I was glad we were friends again. I tried to be kinder and more patient and understanding with her. But honestly it didn't work. We had another big argument shortly.

She told me she was planning on trashing her phone. I was really hurt. It was the only way I had to contact her, as she couldn't mail me since her mom couldn't stand online friends. I told her I was feeling like shit because of her doing this, but she said it was because she truly believed she would be happier without her phone, and she wasn't doing it to trash me. That's not how I felt and when I got those messages I had to lock myself in the bathroom and cry. I felt so unimportant to her.

We argued about it for a while but I kept trying to keep in my frustration and hurt. Then randomly one day I snapped. All those feelings of her being a fake friend came back. I told her I was so fucking done with her and if she ever messaged me again I would reactivate the account, and that she should go die in a hole.

A couple days later I apologized but asked her to still not contact me, and eventually after about two weeks I asked to talk to her. She said all the suicidal feelings came back and she went back to her habit of harming herself and crying to sleep. She kept saying things like ""go ahead, tell me I should die"" when I was apologizing and she eventually threatened to kill herself. I contacted her mom through one of her friends and told her to make sure she was okay. I know she was abusive but I know she wouldn't let her kill herself. She was okay, but she also told her all the things I did to her, which resulted in her mom telling me to kill myself and threatened me with a court case and tracking me down if she had to. Honestly wasn't worried about her threats at all, and even if I did get in trouble, well I deserved it.

So yeah, I am sorry this was so damn long. I just wanted this entire situation off my chest. I feel so guilty for how I hurt her and constantly cry at night because of it, and I miss her so much. I wish I wasn't such an asshole. I have never treated anybody so poorly in my life yet she's the closest friend I have ever had. I'm usually extra nice to girls and I was always there for her when she was hurting or needed anyone but sometimes my emotions would go crazy and my mind would get truly fucked up. A lot of it has to do with us being only online friends. I really don't treat any of my friends in real life like that.

I really wish she would listen to me apologize and kind of explain why I was hurt, and allow me to make it up to her by maybe like mailing her a gift. I miss her. I genuinely hope she's okay. I don't want to believe I'm an awful person because I do care about her, and so many other people in my life, but sometimes I'm just a terrible person with the way I explode. I don't know if I should forgive myself, I feel like I deserve to hate myself and have everyone around me hate me.

*TL;DR I emotionally tormented my best friend because I was so insecure and vengeful for times she really hurt me, even though it usually wasn't her fault, and it resulted in so much harm towards her. I feel like I deserve so much worse because of what I did.*

I'm sorry if this doesn't seem like the best sunreddit to post this, but it does deal with two people who suffer from it and causes a lot of pain in their life even though the mail focus has been on the relationship. This sunreddit also seems the most supportive from others I have tried.

Anyways, happy New Year's everyone. I hope you guys enjoy it ð",4,"Bullying, parental abuse, and at one point a boy from her school pretty much threatened to rape her, my clingyness to her, downhill in our friendship, it was getting toxic, being a fake friend, lot of guilt for what I had done to her"
"Last night, I ended a relationship I had with someone that I'm very, very in love with. We can't be together now or anytime in the near future because of distance, and that was becoming unbearable. I started talking to another guy, someone I don't really know at all, and this is how I ruined what I had with the guy I love and I just miss him so much. I can't even talk to him anymore even though I desperately want to. I feel awful about hurting him and talking to him will make it worse no matter how much I wish I could.

I had a ""break up"" with a very close friend recently as well, someone who I share years worth of memories with and used to hang out with weekly. She posted a picture on her instagram story two days ago of her at a specific theme park (plans we had together) with someone else, and then yesterday she posted a picture of her with some new friends captioned ""best gifts of 2017"". My other friends think she is trying to make me jealous.

I live with my parents and my dad has been treating me like shit, today I literally thought he was going to kill me over an unwashed dish. I'm just tired of the abuse, I've gotten enough from him and my mom's ex bf combined. I don't understand what I did to deserve any of that but I guess it will always be beyond me.

On top of all this, I'm becoming very unmotivated in college and life in general, I'm afraid of not being successful in what I truly am passionate about, and I have no job (I quit because of anxiety) and need a new one soon because I'm going to run out of money. 

I feel like shit and like a terrible person, I can hardly eat and I've basically just been crying all day. I have no NYE plans (obviously) and I just hate my life so much. The guy I met recently wants to go out for coffee this upcoming week, and I agreed even though I feel hesitant. I'm just having trouble accepting that I can't physically be with the guy I love. I feel awful for what I've done.

tl;dr, I'm depressed and crying on NYE, almost everything in my life is currently shitty, I ruined something special I had with the person I love and wanted to be with more than anything and ultimately broke his heart

"I'm just gonna leave it here so I can come back to it later. If you look for help this won't help you, after all I can't help anyone.

I see no solution to this problem. It's not like I can't feel anything, that's not it. It's more like every emotion I feel is flat and fake. I can be happy but it is an empty happiness. I can be sad but it doesn't last long before I force myself to feel happy again. I can control it. I can control my happiness. I force myself to laugh and have fun and I feel the dopamine rush.

Deep down, however, I feel like in the long run it doesn't mean anything. I don't know what the goal of life is but it's not to be happy. Not for me at least.

I would love to feel empathy again. I miss it. No matter how hard I try, I can't feel it. It's like I have become immune to it.

I have one male friend who knows everything about me. I believe I'm not homosexual but I think about him a lot recently. It feels like he is someone who I would be able to feel affection towards.

"I'm going through a pretty rough breakup right now, and... I have no one, anymore. I have no one in my life now that I have lost my dove. And it's entirely my fault that I lost her. I fucked up, and now there's nothing left.

I have no idea why I'm doing this. I guess, I just wanted people to see. See some of my conversations with a therapist on trying to improve myself, and... my failing to do so. Just so I can show people that... I tried. This is the first conversation between my therapist and I, about three months ago. I guess you should know I'm pretty straightforward usually and... I'm also pretty fucked up. I was trying to become a better man, for myself... but mostly for her.


I don't know if this will actually interest anyone, but... Well, maybe someone will be kind enough to grant me some company or companionship right now... I am in a very, very dark place and... I would rather have died than to have lost that girl, even... even if we weren't really happy together. I took out the names because... well, the girl in question knows about my therapist, as it was her suggestion and all and.. Despite the fact she will never see this, I still don't want it to be recognized if she does.


 *Hello, &lt;//////&gt;. My name is &lt;/////&gt;. I guess I don't know where to start. Right now, the particular issue I'm having is that my insecurity has been the cause of every relationship I've had failing, and is ruining my current relationship. I have no idea how to stop it. I'm too needy, too clingy, unable to control my emotions at all. I am obsessive, and possessive. I am a hateful, spiteful, angry person and I have no idea how to let go of the things that have happened in the past. I want to change, but all anyone ever says is ""only you can do that"" and ""only you know how"" and that doesn't help. If it's all up to me, then it's hopeless.*


&gt; Hi ///// - Thanks you so much for reaching out and sharing so information about your experiences. My name is ////// ////// and I am a licensed therapist. Reaching out for help takes courage /////, you have made a wonderful first step toward creating the life you have always wanted. You talked about being really sensitive right now and how the way that you are feeling and responding to others is causing a great deal of distress. Based on the things you have shared, what you are feeling makes perfect sense. I have experience working with individuals who are interested in working through the barriers and unresolved issues in life to find a higher level of peace and joy. I would like the opportunity to help you this this time in your life. I would like for you to review my online schedule and select a day and time for us to have a live video session. This session would enable me to share the limits of confidentiality, review consent for therapy, explain what you can expect throughout the therapeutic process and answer any question you may have. Be encouraged, I think therapy might be a chance for a new beginning for you!! In the meantime, can you share more about how you have been dealing with all of the things you are experiencing? Who supports you in times like these?


*I have very few people that I have kept around me. I have no network of real friends, I have no support group. The majority of my emotional stability becomes the responsibility of the person I am romantically involved in, and this causes a great deal of stress to the both of us, and is generally an unhealthy way of handling things. I have only one or two true companions in my life, my closest and oldest of which I no longer get to see because he has moved far away and only visits rarely. Any occasional acquaintances I happen to make almost always end quickly, or never develope beyond anything other than a work mate or occasional social interaction. My family has either moved states away, or has so much drama and conflict that I do not feel it would be beneficial to bring them into my own.*

 *There are many worse things, though, that I feel probably ought to be brought to attention sooner or later. There have been many traumatic events I have experienced from childhood to adulthood that have left me a very isolated person. Even when there are people who try to reach out to me, I do not trust them with knowing most things, and do not want to burden them with my emotional issues. I am not an open person. I also have been diagnosed with ADHD and Insomnia, and the last psychiatrist I saw I didn't spend enough time with to confirm but it is also suspected that I have manic depressive bi-polar disorder or another emotional instability illness based on the time I spent with them and the fact that most of my family has been diagnosed with MDBPD.*

 *As for how I've been dealing with it, I've tried many things over the years, most of which weren't beneficial. Drug and alcohol abuse was severe during particular periods of time. I cannot maintain hobbies or interests for any period of time that could be considered significant. Mostly I just lay in bed, being miserable. I do not have the energy, the focus, or the motivation to do anything. I never have.*

*Many people have told me to seek therapy in the past, but the only time I was ever actually involved in psychiatric evaluation was when I was around 17 or 18, still in high school. At least, that's the only ""adulthood"" memory I can account for. When I was younger, my brothers and I were all involved in group therapy because we had all been sexually assaulted repeatedly by the son of a family friend. I was too young to remember those sessions, though, and the molestation didn't actually end for years following, nor was that the only individual to do so.*

"This year especially. I joined a D&amp;D group this year trying to make friends but they all don't like me or idk because none of them want to be friends. Anyways, they've been texting each other in our group chat (which we have when we need to ask questions like find out if everyone is good to play on our set days) for the past few days about having a New Years party. Everyone but one person said they'd be up for it (the one person was busy)...but they never asked me. They asked everyone else. Never mentioned me, asked how I was, if I could make it, if I wanted to come...nothing.

Party is tonight. Early this morning (like 1-2 am), I get a text from the DM asking about my back (I threw it out a while ago and have been in constant pain), I was thinking ""oh ok this is where he asks if I'm coming.""...yeah no. Just asked about my back, I said it was slightly better since I've been resting and he said something like ""Oh that's good.""...that's it.

And still no one asking about me in the main chat.

It hurts being excluded like that. I can only assume they did it because I don't drive, thus I can't really get to said party or get back home without someone else driving me...but they could at least offer or ask why I've been quiet or anything! It's the thought that counts...just them thinking about me would have made it easier.

This is just cruel. I'm not looking forward to our next game when I have to be around them...",4," but they never asked me, just them thinking about me would have made it easier"
"Iâd like to preface this post by saying if it appears that I am trolling, I am not, but I realise some of these points may seem illegitimate. 

I watched frozen for the first time recently. Being a 20 year old man, I realised I wasnât in the target audience for it, but I watched it nonetheless as I had nothin better to do. As I watched it I found myself strangely entranced. I enjoyed this innocence of it but it was strangely alien to me, like Iâd never experienced something like it before. It got me thinking about my childhood, which Iâve not long departed, and yet have rarely reflected upon.

I thought about how alien frozen was to me, and how I lacked anything like it when I was growing up. I was never shown Disney or Pixar films in my infancy, unlike, dare I say, most people my age. I summed this up to spending very little time with my mother due to her illnesses that rendered her incapable of caring for me in my formative years. Instead, I spent them in the care of my grandparents, who were very kind to me, yet it was not the same as having parents as my friends did. It wasnât until I was around 13 or 14 when my mother took over full time care of me, by which time it was too late for me to gather the classically happy childhood memories I feel Iâm lacking. Even when she took over my care, she was not really the perfect mother, not for lack of trying but due to a lack of experience, (she had me when she was very young compared to the average). She couldnât afford to rent a particularly nice place to stay, in fact it was so run down that I was too embarrassed to invite friends over. Sometimes she invited friends for me by asking their parents, but I soon put a stop to that when I discovered theyâd been talking about my house behind my back, commenting on how grotty it was compared to their middle class mansions in the suburbs. Times got so bad that, on multiple occasions, I remember being told to get on the floor and to be quiet whilst debt collectors hammered on the door in search of our meagre possessions to settle debts for necessities like electricity and gas.

I never knew my father either, in fact I didnât even know his name until about 2 years ago, when I found it out from my birth certificate. I then googled it and discovered he was a convicted paedophile which sent me into a downward spiral of self identity crisis. I always felt this lack of knowledge of where I come from. Friends who didnât understand would often ask me if I missed my dad or not and bullies who found out the information would often use it to their advantage.

I guess all in all what Iâm trying to say is I feel unsatisfied with my childhood, but I was never abused, verbally or physically. I was never homeless or reliant on food banks, despite being close on several occasions. I was always taught to be grateful for what I have. Like that classic quote says, âIf you have running water and a refrigerator, youâre better off than half of the worlds population.â Iâve always hated lines like that, Iâve certainly never felt better off, and even less so when compared to my peers. I quote that comes to mind is âI never wanted more than everyone else, just not the less I was used to.â I donât know if Iâm being melodramatic or if I have legitimate reasons to feel cheated. I guess Iâm just struggling with moving past darker days right now...

"Happy new year. A time when we both look toward the future and look backwards to the past. My future is a dark plcew, a horrible place of nothing but additional resonsibility, more expecttion, and yt more grief, more dissapointmnt, and more angisih. I feel as though I died many years ago. I am now thirty years old, and yet I attempted suicide in my late teens and early twenties. After theray and drugs, and finding true love, I recovered. But this is not  story of a mistreated hero. I am no antgonist of fiction, striving to overcome hardship. My hardship is of my own doing. My heartache is of my own creation. It is cliche to say that it is because I broke up with a girl. I broke her heart and now she is nothing mre than a distant memory. 

I am 30 now, but I figure I broke up with her about 6 or seven year ago. We were together for six years. I'd love to say I was different then but I'm quite sure I was more or less as I am now. This was the kind of love you find once in a lifetime. I have never communicated with one I felt so in tune with. I have never had someone be so patient with my issues. She forgave all my flaws and yet encouraged me to do better. For a while she made me feel as though I was someone ele. I told her I knew if we ever broke up it would be my fault, but she never believed me. 

I'm writing this now as an older man, supposedly moved on, supposedly mre sccesful. I am supposed to have learned and lived and fund new relationships. Many years ago she forgave me, and yet I feel mre and more grief as the years roll by. 

You see lthough I knew that I was incredibly lucky to have found love with oe such as her, I was totally and inexroably unfaithful. This woman loved me. I know this because she put up wit my flaws, and she taught me lie lessons I still repeat today. She is now with a man, or at least he was th last time we spoke, which was around three years ago. She looked healthy last I saw her, when she was with some new guy called Dave, and I noticed she looked so much healthier than I had ever seen her. She was so much more lifeike, confident, and vibrant than she ever was with me. I don't know if she is still with him. I a't brjng myself to messga eher, although not a minute of my waking life passes that she doesn't cross y mind. I miss her so much. Let me tell you that I miss her so very much. I have never told anyone close to me that I miss her, and even if I did tell any of my close confidants, I know no one from the time in which I know the girl I love, so to them it means very littele. More tan enanything in this world I miss her and I cannot possibly type this enough for it to portray how much I feel it. 

One night, 6 year ago or so, I ucked some other girl. I got drunk with a couple of friends on a randm nght out, lost contrl of my senses and my mind. Another girl, some stranger, some nothing, ws flirting with me, and through a series of terribe decisions I ended up sleeping with her within a couple of hours of meeting er As son as I it was done, I relaised what I had done. I called my ex, I tld her in no uncertain terms what I had done. THt I had cheated on her. I had slept with a stranger. I had been drunk. The scream. The scream of sheer angusih I heard down that phone haint s me even no. I cannot explain to you how much that killed me, istening to hr heart brek. This girl had put up with so much from me. She had gone through so much already and now this. That scream still haints me. She was on her way to the shops to pepare a nie surprise for us both when I told her this. She went back home nd I culd hear in her voice she was crying. I was staring at a wall, a foot away from it. I didn't feel like I was even me. I could hear ahe was crying. WHen she got back to her flat all I caould hear was her scream. She had held it in. She cried out, half echoing the word ""no"", half screaming and then she sobbed. I was whispering that I was so sorry. SHe screamed in the most cutting and now angry way ""Why?!""... ""Why would you?!"" I  just told her I was drunk, mindlessly drunk. SHe told me it was over. I agreed, I didn't blame her at all. I knew exactly what I had done. 

I have never been the same since. Judith has told me she forgives me. Was slept together after  year or so. SHe old me I need to learn to forgive myself. But this was five or o years go. Every day since I hve been a shell. I am not me. I diedd years go. I tried to kill myself before i knew her but never since. I just crrried on. I hate myself and my god, my gs. I have hated myself ever since. I am guilty. I m shameful. I broke dher heart. I am scum. I ha something perfect, and I reuined it. I mss her so much. 
I havehad a lot to drink. I tried to stop drinking sicne I cheated on her, blaming the alcohol But here and there, on nights like tonight, I have still turned to the bottle. I want to kill myself tonight. I hate myself. She is with another man, she is another persn, I am another person, she probably has kids by now. SHe is with me every waking hour and every waking day and my god I just can't forget wht I have done. I went back to university, decided to reinvent mysef and escape my past. But I haven't been happy in years. I cannot overcome this, and I should try to kill mmyself. I'm thinking of getting a lot more drunk and cutting my wrists or my throat. Deep enough that I bleed out in the bath. Even if it doesn't kill me, the act would bring me back to a time I feel more comfortable with. I have been so alone since this happened. THis is not the story of a person dealing with hardship. This is all my fault. I broke her heart. I just can't go on being this peron. I cnnot make sense of my narrative, I cannot make this sotry right. I do not want to break my mother's heart by killing myself. I t destroy her too. But I just can't go on anymore and I don't know what the fuk to do. lease if anyone can say anything that makes me feel remotely better, fuck it even if you just try, please do I will rad all of your messages. Please I just don't know what to do. ",4,"cheated on her, broke up with her, forgave all my flaws, feel more and more grief as the years roll by, never been the same since"
"//depressive rant
My friends always ask me why I never hang out with them. Not all the time, but whenever I do actually go out with friends it always comes up at one point. Yet nobody actively invites me to things. Sometimes they do, it seems random sometimes I don't particularly have one main group of friends. 

Honestly this is because I'm afraid. I'm afraid that if I actively tried to hang out with people, I'd end up scaring them away. I've kept myself locked up for years, because I always relied on people to invite me, rather than me planning it out/asking to join along. 

I'm not friendless, but I convince myself I am. I would sit in my house for a week, with my only social contact would be at work, and I'd get depressed. I'd feel lonely, feel like I have no friends, nobody to talk to. Yet people message me almost every day. I get invited to things occasionally, and some people have told me that I can hit them up if I ever want to hang out. But I never do. Not unless they invite me. I fucking hate myself.

//actual post

I didn't try today. I know I could have hit someone up, but I didn't. Someone asked me what I was doing today, told them I didn't know, they told me I should get fucked up with them. Never happened. I didn't even fucking try. Now I'm sitting at home, high as a fucking kite, have had a nasty anxiety attack the entire day, I'm fucking sick of it. My girlfriend is at work so I can't actually do shit. So fuck it. I'm getting high and playing video games, because fuck me.

EDIT: Since I'm high and on the self hate train that I'll have to clean up tomorrow, might as well go deeper because fuck it. I love how I paint this ugly picture and believe it's real. I always make myself lower than everyone else, and I never cut the bullshit even when I realize it's bullshit. I love how I fucking realize all the anxiety in my head, yet I let it get to me anyways. I should be better than this.",4,"always relied on people to invite me, always make myself lower than everyone else,  high and on the self hate"
"I really don't know what to do. The only time I don't feel this just... soul-crushing sadness is when I'm with who I consider to be my best friend. I'm really bad at talking to people and when I try to talk to people about my problems they often don't take me seriously. I also have really bad self esteem.

I've come to realize that what I used to think were good, close friends were just people who were just people that have the ""I'm here for you, but as long as I'm having fun"" mentality. Once I came to this realization, I stopped being the one to initiate conversations and activities outside of school and sure enough, almost none of them invite me to anything or talk to me outside of school and I'm left feeling just.. alone.

Every time I'm around the people who I consider to be my real friends, I feel a bit better. When I'm not talking, I constantly just feel useless, empty and alone. I know my parents love me but ever since I confronted my mother about my problems, she both blamed my problem on playing too much video games and basically told me just to be happy.

Very few things bring me happiness at this point. I thought starting a channel on Youtube and making videos regularly would help take my mind off of my problems so I did for a while. Over the course of a few months, I've gotten some really nice comments telling me that they genuinely enjoy my videos and that they'd like to see more, and that really made me happy. But then once that feeling wore off I felt like I was back to square one. I wish there was a way to enjoy my life without having to work my ass off for a temporary solution

Sometimes, when I'm alone, I just want to let it all out. I'll want to cry so badly but won't

"hey guys, this is something that i dont really do. Usually i use reddit for giggle and shits but now that im so depressed and desperate and i have no one to talk to i come here hoping i can pour my heart out before it pours blood out from sharp objects.

there's this girl, my best friend. Known her for like 3 years and i never thought i could love her so much, for in the past i saw her as annoying and stubborn and whiny but as time goes by i couldnt help but fell madly in love with her (without her knowing). I did make a move last summer but she straight out rejected me. We had a big fight and didnt talk to each other for like 2 months, worst 2 months of 2017, wanting to kill myself all the time and constantly being cynical to everybody. 

But we bumped into each other again at the end of November i think and she cried a lot and she hugged me saying she missed me so much and it was like, the warmest hug i've ever had in my entire life and at that moment i realized i dont want to lose her again, it kills me without her, inside and outside. 

But it's happening again, one night when a friend asked me how i was doing (he knew about my feelings for her) so i told him i still had the same feelings and he said that i should give up because she made it clear to him that she didnt want to take a step further with me. So i was very upset that night and i told him i couldnt because i was in too deep and i couldnt back out and nobody could help me back out and that he shouldnt care, nobody should care because i was dead, i was dead from inside to outside and nobody could help me. Only i could help me but i didnt want to. 

So my friend, i dont know what the fuck he has been thinking, thought it would be somehow of a solution to just tell her how am i feeling and you know what, she got all cold and wouldnt talk to me for weeks. I knew what was wrong but i pretended i didnt know anything. I dont want anything to mess with my head rn because im having an exam in a couple days. But i cant stand the harsh and dry tone when i wish her a nice christmas and new year and thank her for her christmas gift, i tried to ignore it and played it cool but deep down i just want to fucking kill myself to see if she cared. 

she said that we need to talk after my exam and i fear that i might get rejected again and it could also seriously damage our friendship too and i fear that we might break it. I dont want to loss her, she's the reason why i stopped thinking about killing myself buf i cant stand just being her friend. I sometimes think am i those cringy love desperate ""nice guy"" neckbeard who hates women because they reject them on the internet but i think im different. I've known this girl for 4 years now and i cant help but love her for who she is, not just some random hottie to DM on the internet. 

you guys can call me a wimp for whining over a subject that people constantly laugh at (the friendzone), i dont care, i just want to write something down to empty my thoughts for a while because the one person whom i always talk to when i have problems is now cold to me. Pls dont say there are other girls or there are many fishes or stuff like that, im told that and i also tell ppl that a lot and im sick of it. It's like when you're dying sick and the doctor tell you not to die and you can miraculously live. I spend too many brain cells picturing the hanging noose and pills and the razor and i smoked a lot (started smoking when she rejected me for the first time) and my chest hurt and i couldnt sleep well at night and i cant smile anymore.

if you make it down here i thank you sincerely for taking time to read and sorry for lack of punctuations and apostrophes because i write this feeling very bad and i couldnt cry though i want to but i just couldnt, i cant and my hands are shaking rn and i want to kill myself so bad rn. help me im suicidal, no you cant",4,"she straight out rejected me, wanting to kill myself, started smoking "

This year was hell to me and every year before was too. This year I lost 4 pets including one last week and my group of friends turned on me and set out to ruin my life. Hopefully something happens to make this year better but I doubt it. I also hope Kim Jong Unâs fat ass and his family gets assassinated so he canât kill us first,4," Hell, lost 4 pets, out to ruin my life,"
Just had a close friend completely block me and as the title suggests he was a furry. He recently came out as a furry and I was fine with it but recently he started hanging out with his furry friends and just up and blocked me today. One of his new friends might be a pedophile anyways and they were talking about meeting up to go to a con but you know what screw him. So yes I am now depressed as he was my only friend.,4," close friend completely block m,a furry,  pedophile,he was my only friend"
"Itâs almost 2018 and I have realized that this entire year will be added to the others that I have spent in a hellhole. I made a Reddit to rant to anonymous strangers on the internet and am feeling pathetic for it as no one would take me seriously if I said any of this in real life. I am fortunate and appreciate all thatâs been given to me in my life. However, I lacked a loving mother and father growing up and have always been subjected to, dare I call it, severe verbal discipline. Several hours of harsh yelling would be the result of accidentally forgetting to rinse out the mop as a third grader. There is only so many times someone can call you a stupid piece of shit before you believe it yourself. I became a nervous child, and never spoke until spoken to. I would be terrified to play outside of the privacy of a locked room. Despite this, I no longer hold blame to my parents. That is all that they were taught, although nothing can make it right. To this day, I panic when someone of authority even raises their voice slightly. But I believe that forgiveness may as well be the first step to forgiving myself. I am still young, 17, and I would like to say: DEPRESSION IS VERY REAL. It leaves you neglecting everyone around you and your personal hygiene. It saps away your ability to live. I thought I was just âgrowing upâ and that I would grow out of the âmoodsâ. But here I am, five years later, with the only thing stopping me from suicide being the thought of accidentally turning myself into a vegetable. I had suffered from a self harm addiction for the last year and I think Iâve kicked it for good. No one knew. Three rounds of antidepressants and attempts at therapy; yet, the fog still lingers. Does it get better?",4,"lacked a loving mother and father growing up and have always been subjected to, severe verbal discipline, harsh yelling, spent in a hellhole, feeling pathetic, fog still lingers, self harm addiction"

"Iâm 26, all my friends are either happily in relationships or married and Iâm the only single one in the group and have been for a while and itâs been a long running joke amongst us. So much so that one of them tagged me in a Facebook post this morning that said âguess whoâs not getting a kiss on New Years.â I was the only one they tagged in it. 

Do you know how that feels? To have your fucking day ruined before you even get out of bed? It feels pretty goddamn amazing when youâve been numb to everything for a while.

Later on I had plans fall through with some engaged friends who decided theyâd rather spend the evening together just the two of them. Okay, thatâs fine, I understand they donât get much time together because of work but donât agree to make plans with me then decide last minute to change your mind. Especially on a night like tonight.

What else happened? Oh yeah.

I even asked the girl Iâm interested in if she felt like doing something with me tonight after she got of work. What was her response? 

âI donât.â

Wow, fucking 3 for 3. Iâm batting a thousand today in the âno one wants you aroundâ category.

So now Iâm laying in bed, itâs an hour and six minutes into 2018 where I live. Iâve been laying in bed for 4 hours listening to the soft whirring of the ceiling fan do a shitty job of drowning out the sounds of fireworks in the distance representative of people having a memorable evening with their friends and families. 

And Iâm just laying here. With this pain in my chest where I think my heart is supposed to be. Thereâs just a hole there. 

If I try to talk to anyone about it all I hear is âitâll happen somedayâ or some other bullshit disguised as encouragement from the people in my life who have never had to go through this because theyâre happier than theyâve ever thought they could be. 

If my friends were listening Iâd say Iâm sorry that Iâm being such a fucking rain cloud in your beautiful blue sky of a life, but fuck all of you, you donât understand what itâs like to be me. You donât know what itâs like to be in so much emotional pain all the time to the point where you canât even cry to maybe make yourself feel better because of everything being so piled up inside of you that you canât form a single tear. Fuck you. Fuck all of you. I love you all but it kills me to know what you have that I have envied for so long to call my own, if Iâll ever even have the capability to sustain something like that with how black and empty Iâve become watching you all with smiles on your faces every single goddamn day knowing that I canât feel the same way.",4,"numb to everything, piled up inside"
Another NYE spent alone in my room hating my own guts. I can't tell what's worse --- my self pity that I have no friends and just watch snapchats of people having fun without me even though I know its self defeating ORRR the fact I really can't blame people for not inviting me out because even I hate spending time with myself. Add onto that my parents havent allowed me out of the house since I was released from the hospital for being suicidal. My world has become my room which just fucking feeds into my depression like water on a grease fire. God I'm so sick of being me.,4,"Alone, self pity, self defeating, can't blame people, suicidal, so sick of being me"
"It's New year's day, and I just opened up to my parents about my depression. I could hear the disappointment and anger in my father's voice. My mother made no sign of acknowledgement. My brother was playing his games on his computer as usual. And now I feel like I did the wrong and told them about my issues. Happy new year. I'm sorry if this post sucks. I am just kind of running on steam. Sorry.",4,"Disappointment, anger,in my fathers voice , I feel like I did the wrong"
I've read a couple of chapters and this is probably the first self-help book that is working for me. What are your thoughts? Would you recommend?,4, self-help book that is working 
"I'm a college student off on winter break, which means  I have a lot of spare time on my hands. When I have nothing to do my depression gets 100x worse. My parents do not understand that it is hard for me to get up when there is no point to. Why would I get up when I don't have school to attend? Anyway, I was having an episode a couple of weeks ago and wanted to go home. My mother said to me "" why would you want to go home? All you do is sleep anyway, it's not like you have anything to do"". I am 19 years old and have alot of time left in school, which means I have a lot of time before I move out. How do I deal with my parents lack of understanding while getting the support I need? I'm not sure how to deal with this.",4," parents do not understand, is hard,"
