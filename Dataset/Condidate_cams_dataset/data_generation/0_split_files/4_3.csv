"I feel like I was doing great, but after tonight spending time with family and friends. Seeing their relationship and me being alone again has really brought me down again.

"Premise, I have nocturnal enuresis. I'm 17 years old and this condition begins to be the most difficult thing in my life to deal with. Tonight, my parents let me stay at my boyfriend's house as a New Year's gift, so I slept here. I've been finding my bed dry in the morning for a few days, so not wanting to put on a diaper in his house I simply slept in his sleeping bag on the sofa. I fucked up. Though I only slept 2 hours and a half, I managed to wet his sleeping bag, his sofa, and both my pants and my dress. I don't know what to do now, I don't have clean clothes with me, and I know he'll be super mad at me when he wakes up. I hate myself.

"Exactly this day, one year ago, i was devastated from a broken relationship, i was also got laid off from my work. It was then that i decided to talk to one of my high school friend, and we continue to do that for until we became a couple. She is now my ex, she broke up with my, i'd spare you guys the detail but it's pretty much because of long distance relationship, my failure to realize it when she start to lose trust for me, and my stupidest decision ever. 2017 could have been my year, i found job at a place where the co-worker is friendly, and the boss treat me like family. I was in love someone who make me realize what it feel like to truly be in love, who can love me unconditionally. I could have it all, a good job, a wonderful family with her and my kid, yet I fucked it all up because i think too much, i worry too much about the future, about thing that may or may not happen, that i forgot about what important is in the present. I worked too hard for our future when i neglected her in the present, she began to lose trust in me, she was in pain because she think i abandoned her, and I didn't even realize it. Then she made a choice, she decided that she no longer love me and can't continue this relationship anymore. I can't get her to stay, nothing i said matter anymore, i was too blind to see that the girl i love the most was hurt be none other than me. After our broke up, i broke down mentally, i can't feel anything, can't do anything anymore. I was working two job and still in college, i tried my best to stay calm and collected when i'm study and at work. I barely pass the semester, got fired at my second job because i can't keep my mind clear, at least I still have my first job with me. Now, at the end of 2017, i was in that exact same place where i ended 2016, even worse than that. I just hope that i have the strength to go through 2018 without repeating any of that mistake, because i'm too tired of me ruining my life with my overthinking, i try so hard to control it, but i just keep doing that, and it results in me making stupid decision that keep ruining my life.",4,"broken relationship, broke down mentally, lose trust, lost job"

"I have progressed to a point where suicide is plaguing my thoughts every day. Any form of distraction: YouTube and Social Media, hanging out with my âfriendsâ school. Nothing can save me, I feel increasingly depressed and lonely. Winter break has interrupted my only form of solace; school. But I even then I had been exponentially losing interest in school and my grades reflect that shift. I can identify that I am failing I am so pathetic all of my friends are just friends with me out of pity I can trust no one. Everyone has abandoned me and I feel like shit every single goddamn day. Thoughts of suicide and all of my past failures and embarrassing moments no matter how small, are all huge and I feel as if everyone    Either hates me, takes advantage of me for what little intelligence is left, or is just friends with me out of pity or to bully me and belittle me. I have lost the will to Live ages ago. The only thing that keeps me going is the biological urge to not kill myself but even that is being degraded by all of these thoughts. I cannot go on with this.

Maybe the only reason i care about others is because i want a distraction from my own life. i want out of life, i want to end it all, there' is absoultely no reason to keep going. life sucks. seeing assholes in relationships suck, seeing other people be happy sucks. life sucks and it's not worth living anymore, it's just not.this is the first time I've truly felt like there's no potential upside to life, this is what my life is, it will not get better. i can't live 70 more years of this shit. i don't even want to get through the rest of this year.

"The only social media I use often are Youtube and Reddit. I have a Facebook account, but there are no pictures or info and I don't go on it often. I gave in and was curious about what people were posting on New Year's Eve...and I immediately regretted it. Most people were posting their 2017 highlights and boy did they make me feel worthless. One that really got to me was the one who posted about their engagement, moving into their own place together, graduating college, traveling, etc. I just broke down crying for 10 minutes straight after reading her post. 2017 for me was a blur. I cannot give you any highlights of my life because there weren't any for me. Just a lot of crying and regrets. I have no friends or social life, so it's really hard for me to do anything eventful. I just sit in my room alone trying to pass time with the internet. I hate it so much. It is ironic with me because I hate how much technology has advanced (social media wise) and how people are always on their devices nowadays, yet when you look at me .. I am doing what I hate other people doing. Sometimes I feel like if I grew up in the 80s, my life wouldn't be so bad. I wouldn't have a computer, phone, etc to occupy me so I would not feel tired or useless and instead put effort into making friends.

But now i am in bad shape, i have completely lost track with every one in my life. I cant do simple task anymore. I suffer from insanely bad mood swings, for instance i was just on my computer playing games then 5 minutes later i had 10+ painkillers hoping that i would die in my sleep that night. I now dont eat much at all and i stay up until about 5:00 am each night. I am starting to get suicidal thought more and more recently. I have also gone back to cutting my self. I hate myself. Im just a fat piece of s*** in high school that im the butt end of every joke. I dont want to be made fun of anymore, When i do go to a friends house my parents make fun of me because they think im a nerd that hangs out with other nerds. I am just tired of all of this. I want it to end. Im a failure to my parents, my friends, my self. I have started to not talk to any of my friends. I know it would help to talk to them but they donât understand anything i say. They just say âHaHa Sameâ ironically. They think im joking but im not, my hole life has become a joke for others. Its hard for me to just get the motivation to get up on a weekend.

"Posted on this /r/sexuality and I want to post it here since this subreddit is more active.
--

I am a male and I'm 19, I go to college. I have never been happy and content in my life, severe depression that's been on for 4+ years is one of the root causes. Depressed because I have no intimate interactions with females, who I am absolutely attracted to. Three ago I started experiencing thoughts that I would truly find happiness if I were born a female and I don't really know how I find solute in that thought - maybe because of my limited experience with women, but I do not know for sure.

I lost my virginity after two days of my 18th birthday to a hooker and I didn't even get to finish. I've only hooked up with one girl when I was 17 and that included only making out and that was it, apart from those two experiences I have other sexual experience whatsoever.

I need some help to understand my own self and why I feel this way, maybe it's because I need to get more experience with women? (Which is another problem.)

"Yesterday it was the 31st. My aunt's birthday. She is 70 years old.

I used the last bit of my money to buy her pizza, wings, and fries. You know, to treat her. I even massaged her back. I offered to do other stuff for her should she need it, like I always do.

Do you know what happened in the end? She stormed out of my apartment, screaming at me about how much she hates me for ""envying"" her. She randomly brought up topics of the past. Some of which aren't true, such as her saying I abused my cousin back when he lived near me. I've treated her to so much in the past few months, and I thought such a nice gesture would make her happy. I guess not.

""If this is my last day on Earth, good, because now you know the truth.""

An actual quote from her.

Yesterday, on the 31st, I tried to be a good person. I was left crying in my bedroom instead. Now it's 2018. And things look bleak. My boyfriend recently broke up with me. During my relationship with him, I was the happiest I have been in a long time, perhaps ever. I had 0 suicidal thoughts while in that relationship. Now it feels like he's ignoring me despite wanting to just ""be friends"".

Anyone could read this, even people I know, but I don't care. I don't care about anything anymore. I'm left wanting to die constantly. Anything is better than continuing to live this life I live. I just don't care anymore. I don't matter. I'm useless. My own mother is mentally unstable, and now I am too. I inherited it. The conditions I grew up in made me who I am now. I can't get a job. I can't get money. I can't be happy.

I'm a 19 years old girl, never been with a guy, only with a woman. I consider myself bisexual. I've been watching porn since 9 or I think much more younger than that. 

I grew up on a terrible family. During nights when I was young I always hear my Mother and Father having sex, worst even if I'm sleeping beside them. Sometimes, I think it is a make up sex that theyre are doing..

When I was young, I really had a thing with older men. Ive been groped a lot of times.. and the worst thing is that I actually enjoy it. It made me feel arouse when someone is groping me and I dont know why. That's why in porn, I'm being aroused as well with groping or.. force or worst gang sex whatever they call that. I used to masturbate and still masturbating for it.  I dont know why am I so into it even if I know that porn industry is evil and I dont ever want to be raped. I dont want casual sex as well.. but still I find myself masturbating to it and being so aroused by it. 


That's one of the things that depressing me. I want to stop myself from masturbating, I want to stop myself from watching porn.. thing is now, I'm on a long distance relationship and she's into kinky stuff.. i just dont know what to do anymore

I had another group of friends I thought I was getting closer with, we were supposed to go to a New Years party together. They ditched me, Iâm not sure why, or what happened. I think it might have been accidental, but none of them cared enough to try and fix it.

Also just found out the first group of friends had a New Years party. I didnât get invited, even though Iâm back in town for the holidays.

"Just today.

Suddenly feeling utterly hopeless. I haven't fantasised about dying since the short time I did 3 years ago.

I feel no interest in doing anything else since Sunday... not schoolwork, continuing to look for a job, gaming, reading, watching movies or anything today. I have written a haiku but that is all I have done this morning. I like their syllable structure and it's easy to work with. I have started trying writing poetry a little bit just this weekend as oddly enough I am interested in that.

I have been fantasising about dying since yesterday. I guess because I feel like I already am dead. I can't tell anyone or more therapist because they'll probably lock me up in a hospital or something and that is neither pleasant for me, plus it would inconvenience everyone else.

Since playing this stupid horror game for a little bit today that a friend has recommended, the fantasies have gotten a bit more intense. I am not going to actually do it but it is weird to me that usually my depression manifests itself as only apathy with hopelessness. Now I feel pure despair and almost a self indulgent desire to pass away and not have to fight anymore.

I just really, really want to give up. I have a great family, great educational opportunities, decent health and a family that help me through so much of my stupid shit. I am a useless sack of shit that i can't take advantage of all the things I have going for me. I think literally everyone would be better off not having me around. I feel like such a burden to everyone yet they don't want me to relieve them of that burden (me) and me of my burden (having to keeo fighting myself) and it feels bad.

We're both involved in creative majors and so the anxiety of wether or not to chase a creative path is worth it or not is a main form of anxiety for the both of us. For me it's a bit better because art has been something I've been wanting to do all my life and can't see myself doing anything else. Slowly our relationship just began to deteriorate. We'd go to the same hangouts, do the same things, become bored of it, started becoming more irritable with each other, have less and less to talk about, and eventually have nothing at all to say to each other. It was devastating, meeting up for a hangout and seeing that they obviously didn't want to. They have another friend they're close to but unlike me is someone quite extroverted and humorous with a vibrant personality. I'm more shy and my depressive episodes involve a lot of me just wanting to be left alone. 

They're a bit of the passive aggressive type but I can always see what they're feeling wether they say it or not. We had been close for such a long time and then all of a sudden this other friend had become their #1. I've had trauma in the past where friends have left me in the dust so it doesn't hurt as much as it did during those times but it does sting a little. My attitude towards it is that I just give up. I don't care anymore. I see when they third wheel me and I just don't have the energy to give a shit anymore. I want to slowly fade away. I feel like I've tried my best to rekindle what we had, but it becomes a little tiring when it's all one-sided. It sucks that I feel this way on New Years, so honestly I just want to let it go. I have another really good friend which I'm fortunate to have and I will continue to put effort into the relationships that deserve it. I came to rant about this, but I feel a lot better now getting it off of my chest. I'll be looking into seeing a doctor for the first time ever about my depression and I'm feeling hopeful. Happy New Years everyone.",4,"had trauma in the past, relationship just began to deteriorate, irritable with each other ,passive aggressive"
"hi --
For reference, I'm 21 and female.

First of all, I have a sister who is depressed. I know what that looks like: she contemplates the futility of her existence; she thinks she's worthless and generally has a deep-seated self hatred; on bad days, she cries herself to sleep and on the worst days she doesn't feel anything at all. I support her as best I can, but she often gets frustrated with me because I seem very far-removed from her mindset. I've always been a happy person, self confident (some might say to the point of arrogance), productive, etc. In particular, my sister cares a lot about what people think of her, and she often grows impatient with my inability to empathise with that position.

As much as I can enjoy living, I have no attachment to it. It's like the self-preservation instinct isn't there. I don't fear death, and I've experienced a good amount of physical pain in my life and I don't fear that either. I often just feel very removed from myself - disassociated - as if I'm looking from myself from very far away. Often I don't think of myself as a person but as a function of my activities (recently, a lot of work). Yes, I love people and I take an interest in intellectual material and I live both for the people in my life and my inner world, but if it makes any sense it often feels like my inner world itself is an external phenomenon, like I have no self. To borrow a line from Sylvia Plath: ""I am nobody. I have nothing to do with explosions."" And if it offers any insight: I don't cry very much, but when I do it's almost never for myself - it's for something larger and more abstract, like the Holocaust, or the rape crisis in India.

I just don't know what's wrong with me. I can be charming and engaged - I'm a creative type and very tactile. I'm confident in myself. Above all, I am happy making meaning within my own life, at peace with the knowledge that its significance is purely relative. But when I refer to myself it feels like I'm referring to some construction outside of myself, like the 'I' is still some distance away. For that reason, my self-preservation instinct in pretty switched off. I often think of death - not in a longing way, just in a morbidly curious way. Everything I value I can just as easily disengage, because those values seem arbitrary. The world is a beautiful place but it will keep turning without me (and everyone else). I don't think I'll ever kill myself, but my detachment sometimes scares me.

Is this normal, to an extent? Or is something wrong with me?",4,"sister who is depressed, often grows impatient with my inability to empathise with that position.

"My parents are divorced since I was 3. No big deal, many people started off worse. I've been living with my mom and rarely meet my dad because I'm too busy. Recently, I met up with my dad and my foster mother, and they thought I might have some psychological problems. Not severe, but still. They wanted to get me checked out. But my mom don't agree. She thought the other parents were overreacting. Personally I do feel off balance at times, and I WOULD get myself tested just to see if I'm okay or not. But even when I expressed that wish, mom still wouldn't take it more seriously and ignore it.
I don't want to come to my dad crying out for help because that would just make my mom and dad argue once more, and many many more problems regarding my family might ensue. But I still feel really upset with the fact that mom wouldn't get me any help even though it costs her nothing.

"First post here, and I actually hoped that I never felt like I needed to address these things. 

It's new years eve, its 5am here in Denmark. And i'm done.

So long story short.
I was 130kg (287 pounds) at 15 years old. My parents pretty much didnt really care, and all that.
When i turned 15, i knew there was 6-7 months for high school to start, so i joined a gym. Read all i could online. Lost 40kg, at for the first time looked like a human being. Yet, I couldnt get with any girls. I was pretty much ""broken"" in the head for being too fat and weird. I didnt give it. I read Mystery Method, The Game, practiced all the time, and had some luck. I finished high school, and after that, my genetics pretty much fucked me over. 

Keep in mind, I work out 5 days a week. I even became a personal trainer. But my genetics makes it very difficult to lean down all the way, and i also (like my father, and brother) have a pretty chubby face.  im in my mid 20's and my hair is thinning so bad, and people keep mentioning this. 

Im the ugly guy, in my group, even though im the person who spends most time taking care of myself. But im just ""gentically ugly"" so to speak. Ive seen so many girls around me, hook up with wrong guys, and ""friend zoning"" me. I had a crush on a girl, who hooked up with a 20 year old idiot douche, just because he is better looking, basically because of genetics. 

I hate this. I dont deserve it. I always try my hardest. Best at my school at software programming, best at most things that I do, because i keep figting for what i want. But I dont wanna do this shit anymore. Im giving up. Im not getting any ""wins"" with my life. I see myself struggling and fighting so much more than other people my age...

im in my mid 20's. This should be the best years of my life, but im only getting uglier, and I cant take it anymore...

I dont even know why im writing this. Guess sometimes its just nice to feel that you are being heard...",4,"My parents pretty much didnt really care, friend zoning"" me"
"I get it. I'm awkward at parties. I'd probably say no if you invited me to a huge party anyway. Doesn't mean I don't want to be invited. And when it's 4 or 5 of my 'closest friends' all having fun and playing board games together and no one wanted me to be there it makes me feel the worst I've felt since I started taking antidepressants.

I don't want to feel like this any more. I don't want to feel anything any more. I spent so long trying to convince myself that there's no huge fucking glaring flaw with my personality that drives people away but I guess the universe just keeps trying to convince me otherwise.

end of 2016-
i met her (iâll call her megan for the story) through some mutual friends. at the time she was dating one of my best friends (iâll call him danny for the story). so i had a class with meganâs bestfriend(iâll call her gwen for the story) &amp; danny, and we all got along perfectly. then suddenly me &amp; megan(she doesnât attend this school) become close friends through snapchat. apparently our sisters are friends &amp; we related a lot through music. well about a month later, gwen &amp; danny arenât aware me and megan are really close friends friends. then at like 2:00 in the morning she sends me a text talking about her feelings for me &amp; not gonna lie i felt the same. we have officially âtakenâ each other, but she still hasnât broken up with one of my best friends danny. well danny &amp; gwen learn &amp; gwen was cool with it. but danny hated my guts. this was like the third time a girl he liked or dated turned to me. i was known for getting his âsloppy secondsâ. me and megan get into an argument &amp; stopped talking &amp; dating.

fast forward about 4 months-
sheâs at my school &amp; i have a girlfriend at the time. but i really felt megan like really felt for her &amp; i still do... but now danny, megan, and gwen go everywhere together &amp; all 3 hate me. gwen cut me off cause iâm âsketchyâ, danny pretends to be my friend but turn on me &amp; consistently make plans w/o me &amp; megan. i try SO hard to be her friend and itâs just not working. she avoids me &amp; it fucking torture. i lost her, and i knew i deserved it. i shouldâve never argued, i shouldâve never said anything. it constantly pains me, watching her smile with all my âoldâ friends. i just need advice or help. i just need a glimmer of hope.",4,"we have officially âtakenâ each other, but she still hasnât broken up with one of my best friends danny"
"Holidays are over. Christmas presents are opened, food has been eaten, the old year is done and the new year has begun.

When I get back to work the inevitable question will come up: ""How was your holiday?""

I will answer ""It was alright."", or ""Just fine, nothing special."" or I will outright lie and say ""Was a fun time and got to spend some time with family.""


**What I really mean is:**


I spent my christmas alone. There were no presents, there was no family dinner. I spent christmas eve laying on the couch, sick with the flu and fever, eating microwaved pasta while watching christmas movies on Netflix, which honestly makes me even more depressed but I enjoy watching them nonetheless. 

On the day after christmas I spent the day gathering enough willpower and strength to go outside, not because I wanted to, but because my headache was killing me and I needed both painkillers and more food since my fridge was literally empty. Trip to the gas station for junkfood and painkillers was the 'highlight' of christmas for me.


On new years eve I was still a bit sick. I heard the first fireworks go off around 8 or 9pm. I kind of wanted to go outside and see them, but then I knew I would be standing alone like an outsider and watching the fireworks would be more likely to make me cry than smile. People may wonder why. Watching fireworks which is supposed to be happiness and bring in the hope of a new year. I see no joy or hope in the next year. Instead I see another year, another 365 nights of loneliness and darkness, another 12 months of coming up with excuses to avoid social gatherings and family events. Not that I get invited to those much anymore anyways. I went to bed at 10pm and slept until late in the morning. Happy new years to me.


**I will never tell my coworkers this, nor my family.**


Why would I? It just makes them sad too, and I don't want to make others depressed and talking about it just makes me sad and upset to the point where I end up in tears myself. I have no desire to be in tears in front of anyone or drag them into the dark pit where I'm stuck. Besides, what reason do I have to be sad or depressed? I have a nice job, stable economy and live well. If I was to really tell them how I feel I fear it would sound like whinging, complaining, being 'an entitled ass' or worse.


I know my friends probably think I don't like being with them since I almost always end up declining invitations, or just canceling in the last minute. I really do want to be with them, but when the moment comes it feels overwhelming, I feel out of place, I'm anxious and upset cause I don't want to bring down their joy. They invited me to christmas parties the previous years. This is the first year where I never heard anything from any of them...

I know my family probably thinks I'm upset with them or angry for something since I never show up for family dinners and events anymore. They didn't invite me this year either.

I know my coworkers probably think I'm just a misfit or arrogant since I decline every teambuilding and social gathering at work. That, and I generally eat my lunch alone by my desk rather than going to the cafeteria with everyone else. The few times I went I end up not talking anyways and just withdraw. I'm sure they think I am being rude or anti-social on purpose.


I love my friends, my family and I enjoy working with my coworkers.


But when they ask ""How was your holiday?"" how can I do anything but dodge the answer or lie?


So now it is 2018.
