"Do you have an animal to help you with anxiety and depression?

I have been finding myself gravitate towards wanting to get an animal to help myself with anxiety and depression. I have two boys ages 6 and 11 and I think an animal would do them well too, my youngest is the biggest animal lover ever and my oldest has always wanted one. 

Do you find them to help with your depression and anxiety? How do? And what do you own?

Thanks.",4,finding myself gravitate towards wanting to get an animal to help myself with anxiety and depression
I feel like a loser because I do not have a group of friends. I have friends but I do not have a group of them to be with while I'm at college. I feel like a loser because I'm always alone. Unfortunately I'm to blame because I am extremely introverted and self conscious. I'm self conscious to the point where I won't be friends with people because acquaintances mocked them frequently. I'm very lonely. I began to use weed as a coping mechanism for my depression and we all know how that has turned out. I'm very low risk because I believe that I have more to live for. I'm just tired of feeling alone. ,4,"feel like a loser because I do not have a group of friends,  feel like a loser because I'm always alone"
"It hurts so much. The distance between myself and the people I know keeps growing, and it's all my fault. I've turned myself into a guy that noone wants to deal with, and its breaking my heart.

"I'm really bad at making friends, and worse at moving on when I mess up and lose one. My trust issues make it a lot harder to accept that certain people genuinely care for me.

A few months ago I had a really bad anxiety attack and said a lot of awful things to a friend who had been incredibly amazing and supportive. She no longer talks to me. After continued (useless) therapy and meds, sobering up, and staying away from the knife, I was unable to prove to her that I had gotten any better. And I haven't. I cut off all my friends without saying a word because I knew that I would rely on them and that there was a good chance of another bad attack, and because I felt unwanted, excluded, and hated. After several weeks, I tried to reconnect with some of them, but they definitely want nothing to do with me. I feel ashamed that I've let my depression get this far.

Even if they were to give me another chance, I'm not even sure how to be happy at this point. I know that I will unintentionally make them feel worse, manipulate, and push them away. I don't want to, but I become a really shitty person when I get close to people. In addition, I don't think I would feel any different. I think that I would still feel unwanted, even if that isn't how they feel or treat me. I don't know what to do. 

I don't want to be alone, but I also don't want to be a harmful presence to the people that I care about. And it seems that I piss them off no matter what I do, and I don't know if I actually am or not because I'm so broken at this point. Everything is so convoluted at this point that I don't even know if I'm being honest or hiding parts.

Not really sure what can be said. I'm just venting and hopefully letting someone else know that they aren't alone.",4," trust issues make it a lot harder to accept that certain people genuinely care for me, really bad at making friends, and worse at moving on when I mess up and lose one,"

"I've recently had a bad break up. I was dating a really great girl but she dumped me. We were really close friends after we broke up and even made out once after, but after that she kind of ghosted me on everything because she didnt want to get back together with me. Its been a while since then and I kinda lashed out at her, which pushed me out of her close friend circle and into some ambiguous territory where she can talk to me from time to time (Nowhere as frequent as before) about random shit, none of it personal and deep like it used to be. She doesnt trust me anymore. I know Im supposed to move on from my ex after Im dumped, especially if Im still in love with her, but I dont have any close friends and my ex was my best friend when we dated too. I tried to go on without her for a while when she ghosted me, but I was in the darkest place I had ever been in, I literally was so close to attempting, since then I've reached back out to her and I've reached a state where unlike before, I can live life, but I have a very strong urge I will never be happy because she will never be with me again. 

So we've been talking again for a day or two, a month ago, if she was active she would literally be texting me, she would tell me anything and everything, and that brought so much joy to my life. But now she'll talk to me about some random shit every few hours, seening my all the time like she doesnt really wanna let me in. But honestly, its better this way for my mental health than not talking to her at all. She often expresses how ""I still mean a lot to her"".

I know through some sources that shes started to click with some other guy like we used when we first started dating and Im honestly so close to a fucking mental break down. Just the idea of her moving on already is like a fucking dagger through the heart, but if I stop talking to this girl I lose myself entirely right now. I dont know what to do, one of my friends died last night and that has put me in an even worse place than before. I would usually talk to my ex about it but shes pointed out (and its true) that I had a phase where I would go to her and seek attention and support and shes tired of it. I know shes right because it was an extremely narcissistic phase and It was definitely my bad. Anyway, I dont really know what to do, I havent cried in a few days but I think I will today.",4,"was dating a really great girl but she dumped me, were really close friends after we broke up, even made out once after, but after that she kind of ghosted me on everything, she didnt want to get back together, Its been a while since then and I kinda lashed out at her, which pushed me out of her close friend circle"

"I know for me I came to realize by my late teenage years that I have developed dual brain consciousness. What I mean is I alternate between two states at any given moment. Around friends and family I ""turn on"" my visual hemispheres. I actively look to be creative and funny and this drains my energy. When I'm alone I turn off and operate entirely on unconscious awareness. I will stare at the wall and ""recharge"" No thoughts, no feelings, like a dead man. People who caught me in the ""off mode"" have told me I  have dead eyes. 
   
All of this translates to my sex life (non existent right now) But when it was active I was never able to cum inside a woman. The reason being sex is a spontaneous act. And i operate like a robot in the off or on mode. I simply can't let go like other people. 

This is what causes my depression. Could be autism, adhd, or any other host of illnesses. Bottom line is after 25 years I realize you can't change it hard as you try.

"Hi Reddit. I don't know where to turn so I'm posting here.

Ever since my break up a month ago, it's been very hard to feel happiness.

We were together for more than two years and it was one of those relationships where we were very close. We depended on each other very much and were each other's best friends. I have a very hard time meeting people and making friends but I was totally happy to just spend time with her all the time. Literally my ""me time"" that I relished in before the relationship became ""us time"" and it felt good and right for me. We told each other we were in love before the relationship officially started and while I think the feelings of love morphed and changed and were periodically lost over the course of the relationship, she was always my best friend in the world. I trusted her completely and her company was all I needed.

We traveled all around together. Last summer we worked seasonal jobs in Alaska and then headed to the Grand Canyon after that to work through the winter. We had all these plans that I was so excited for and I was so happy to be able to have that experience with someone I was so close to. Nothing seemed off about the relationship and I trusted her so much I didn't think to question a new ""friendship"" with a guy she worked with.

Fast forward to a month ago and she wakes up one morning and tells me she hasn't been very happy being with me for a few months now and that she's developed feelings for this dude. I was totally shocked and blindsided. My entire world was turned upside down. Everything I enjoyed about life was suddenly gone and I was completely alone. She moved on without so much as a second guess like it was nothing. I found myself in a very shitty situation and I ran back home to my parent's house.

My self esteem is completely gone. I feel worthless, replaceable, unimportant, unattractive, and used. All the plans we made together are now hers and she's carrying them out with her new fuck buddy, like I was never even there. Everything I wanted for this winter is completely gone. I feel as if my life was stolen from me. These plans meant so much to me and they were suddenly hijacked. I feel like I'm stuck back where I started. My life has changed so much since I met her and I have no idea how to continue that without that type of relationship with someone. I want to get back out there and get a new job somewhere and travel again but I'm terrified to do it alone. Happiness is only real when shared after all.

The result is I've been severely depressed. I barely eat. I only get up to smoke cigarettes. Nothing at all that I used to enjoy gives me any pleasure. Conversations with old friends and family do not stimulate me at all. I cannot feel a single modicum of happiness. I feel either depressed, angry, insecure, or anxious at all times. I literally have not felt a single positive emotion since we broke up. It's been a month now. There are no ""good days"" along with the bad ones, there are only and always bad days. I strongly fantasize about suicide on a daily basis. I don't want to, and I doubt I will, but the thought of all my problems disappearing and not existing anymore is one of the few gratifications I can derive in this state of mind.

All I do is obsess over her and what she's doing and think about our old times and what should have been and go over every reason I hate her in my head over and over and over and over again. Today I sent her a million nasty texts to try to get under her skin and make her fight me. She just told me to go fuck myself and to stop texting her and that was that. I hyperventilated and got in the shower and punched the wall over and over and cried and screamed.

I feel I am unwell and I do not know what to do.

Sorry for the long post.",4,"since my break up a month ago, it's been very hard to feel happiness"
"Hello. First of all, i apologize about my English. I'm 17yo and I do not usually speak english. I'll do my best for sure.
I'll present myself shortly : 
I'm a 17yo white boy in Western Europe, 1m85 tall. Diagnosed HIQ ( 144, with a IQ verbal/IQ perf rate = ~1,3 ) at the age of 10 and dealing with ego problems, i've been depressed the two last years because of hyper-empathy ( a fucked up word to explain that my exgirlfriend's rape's story traumatized me. ) and social awkwardness. ( I've got few friends that i've known since elementary school which i love, but furthermore, i have never been a sociable person. )
So, after those two years of moderate to severe depression, I've been going better the last three months, since i've definitely broke up with my toxic ex-girlfriend, but i'm recently going worse since i met this other girl. We met each other two and a half month ago. This night, I was crying so badly because of my ex when she came to me and gave me a hug. She took care of myself, she heard me, she told me her own story, and then we slept together. Since this night, we have been dating each other. 
She has been so nice with me all this time long.
Two months later, i'm feeling as if i'm not deserving her. By induction, i'm feeling as if i wouldn't ever been able to be happy with anyone due to my low self esteem. ( That was already a problem during my last love-relationship. )
I've already use to struggle with depression, but what panics me is that i'm in graduating class and I have to succed it if i wan't to have a nice CPGE ( preparatory classes to prestigious universities ) and thus i would more likely get a well ranked university. 
I'm feeling lost. I don't have any idea about what i should do, if I should leave her asap to flee my own problems, if finally works shouldn't have the priority for once and i should focus about myself, or if i'm not seeing the most important here...
Thanks to you if you read me, that was pretty difficult for me to write ""non-academicly"" in English. If i did loud ( or even slight, but it should contains a lot and i wouldn't take up too much of your time ) mistakes, i would be glad to learn and improve my English, by the way. Have a nice day or a nice evening. It's 4a.m. for me while i'm writing this. ",4,my exgirlfriend's rape's story traumatized me

"I feel like most of us are leaning way more toward the emotional than the stoic. And as a male I have been trained to not be emotional, and also there really isn't a support system in place. Friends are great but it's more shooting the shit and screwing around than having sessions where i can just open up and cry. Even female friends of mine in the past seemed weirded out when i just needed to vent and share and break down a little. I have built boundaries that keep my self propped up on a bed of twigs to where i am solitary in what ever i am feeling. And when the weight is there those twigs snap and i have nowhere to turn. It's created i very unhealthy situation where it's all or nothing. If i open up i gush, and if i don't then you will never see that side of me. I'm sick of ""maning up"", sick of having to accommodate some bullshit notion that i can't feel. I was always a sensitive kid and i am a sensitive adult but perpetually hiding behind a mask of indifference which creates a cognitive dissonance on the basic story of who the hell i even am. When im ""stable"" im just living a lie i've been trained to live. And when im broken all the feelings i've suppressed come out and bite me right in the ass and boom i can't function anymore. 

How can you create balance?  I feel like most people are able to ride both conforming with the world and expressing themselves in some kind of way that doesn't have to be at total odds with each other. Where when something triggers them, they don't fall into a state where they can't even take care of themselves. Obviously there is a lot to do with the fact they have a more balanced brain chemistry, and their threshold for pain is far higher but i still think there is something to this lack of balance that contributes heavily to depression in general. 

Also, sidenote, as a man how in the hell can i find someone to open up to? I just need to talk sometimes and need a hug and don't want the entire emotional burden to be placed on a SO (which i scare away due to said mistake).

"When I was followed by the darkest of clouds, I fought to bring myself back to wanting to enjoy my life. I found my enjoyment of making things... things that make me feel good and that hopefully will one day bring some joy to someone else. Here's a few things I have created so far (see etsy page below).

"Iâve been working with the guy for the past two years. Heâs been a great co worker. Heâs been through a lot since I me him. He fought for custody for his 3 kids and son. Heâs a great man and co worker. Today he got called into the office. Our boss told him that he needs to get at least one of the eight certifications by beginning of February or he will be let go.

"Feeling a bit lonely. We can chat about your shit or mine or just stupid shit. About me 32 yo F, separated, 3 kids. I'm a total nerd. I enjoy reading, cooking, Netflix, sci-fi, fantasy, video games, being lazy, being active...just lots of stuff.

"I met a few people online last year who I thought I could talk to about my feelings. They were nice to my face about it, but they were passing around private things I said to their friends along with pictures of me, my location, and my full name. They even try to force my friends to apologise for being friends with me. I feel dumb that I could be so trusting. None of my friends that I made after this know about my struggles; I know none of them would treat me this way, but my mind refuses to listen to me.",4,"met a few people online last year, thought I could talk to about my feelings, were nice to my face about it, but they were passing around private things"

"3 years ago I moved in with a drunk. A man who drank at least a whole bottle of vodka a day. He would do the most random crazy shit he would punch a flat screen tv countless times for no reason, beat his girlfriend and bruise her, head butt her mom and scream and yell. One time he forced us to leave with his girlfriend at 12pm in the rain and we had to walk down the road until the cops came and  asked if we were okay. Things like this happened all the time. My bedroom was right under there's and I was forced to listen to them scream at each other and his girlfriend crying and screaming ,things getting thrown, her being thrown around and then having sex. I lived with them for 3 years and the final year I noticed a difference in myself. My room was kept constantly dark I would sleep all night get up and go to school and then come home and go right back to sleep when I was up all I could do is read for hours or watch tv blankly. I started to be rude to my mom and my family members. Whenever they would come in my room I would yell at them to get out (I'm pretty sure they just think I'm a cunt) before all this happend I got into a relationship with someone I didn't want to be with because I was being reckless. the last year I broke up with her (I don't even like woman either but I still dated her) I started to eat way to much and I started to stop talking. I missed a lot of school to the point where my mom was almost brought to court. I don't know if this matters but my style started to change and the music I listened to. I had no energy or motivation. At the time I didn't know I was depressed I just knew I was unhappy. 

Right now I have to share a room with my brother since we are staying with someone until we find our own place. The darkness comes out when I'm alone, and rn I'm constantly around someone which threw me into this state of numbness. It gave almost the complete opposite affect I can't eat I can't sleep I don't want to do anything and I'm still unhappy. I miss sleep. I want to come home and sleep so that the days will go  by until we get our house. I just want to sleep forever 
Does anybody know anyways I can make myself sleep?  
Sleep is such a good pass time but I've been having trouble with it

"Hey guys! Iâm new here, and I have been hesitant to speak on this. My depression started around 3 years ago during my sophomore year in high school, and Iâve tried to suppress it as much as possible, but unfortunately it still plagues me in small instances while being in my second semester of college. One of them that I canât seem to shake, is not being interested in literally anything. I used to love video games, now I canât play one for 5 minutes without getting bored or annoyed. I used to love skateboarding, and now I canât stand to go out and do it. Can anyone give me tips or solutions?

"I've always been someone who has a small circle of very close friends and not much else and I'm fortunate that my current friends are wonderful people and very supportive of me, but I still feel very insecure in my relationships with them. Leaving high school has been very good for me, but I think to some extent I've sabotaged my own recovery and kept myself constantly sad out of fear that if I'm not in need of emotional support that my friends will leave me because I won't have anything to offer. Recognizing this has been good for me but I still am afraid that my friendships will naturally peter out because of my own deficiencies as a person. Does this make me a bad friend? I feel like I've been manipulative and an unnecessary burden and I don't know if that's a product of my own self-dislike or a reasonable reaction to my behavior.",4," small circle of very close friends, fortunate that my current friends are wonderful people and very supportive of me, but I still feel very insecure in my relationships "
"Three years ago my dad died, it hardly feels like three weeks. It's like everything else in my life is so insignificant in comparison, it's like a black hole that distorts my perception of time. It's as if time passes 100x faster since it and everything before it is so long ago.

People say that after a major event in their life everything feels categorised into before and after it but to me it feels like things that are it and not, but most of them are.

People have been telling me since then that I probably have depression and should maybe get help but that's mostly just from seeing me because I don't open up. I feel like I've just always been a little gloomy and don't feel very different now compared to before other than the whole bending of time thing. People say they noticed a change in me, but I didn't, maybe they just expect something like that to mess up a 14 year old?",4,"three years ago my dad died, it hardly feels like three weeks"
