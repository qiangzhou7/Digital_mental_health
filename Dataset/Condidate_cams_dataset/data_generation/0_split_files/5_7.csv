"It's difficult to describe how I feel really because I have no reason to be depressed at all but I am! When I wake up in the morning I'm so disappointed that morning has arrived and i have to live through another day, I try to go back to sleep so I don't have to face the feelings I have! I don't want to burden everyone with my depression and be the one that people avoid because I'm always miserable and low. I'm anxious all the time and don't know how to control this, anxious about the smallest things that other people do each day with ease. Taking a train or a plane can trigger anxiety days and days before and make me feel so low. These feelings I cannot control and really wish I could. I came off my anti-depressants last year and now I'm thinking of going back on them but really don't want to. All the time I feel I'm going round and round in circles with such a heavy load!! Does anyone have any ways of dealing with such feelings? ",5,"disappointed,"
"I have extremely bad depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. I stopped taking this medication 5 months ago and didnât tell my doctor or family. I wanted to try do it alone. 

My OCD has started destroying my life again. Iâm not sleeping at all because I am checking my children and husband are breathing every 4 minutes every night. 

I need to start taking them again as they did help me, I just could not reach orgasm on them. My sex drive did not drop but it was so frustrating. Is this a common thing?

"I feel like depression and anger are linked, and I'm poorly dealing with both.

At my worst, I feel like I want to fight or insult others, which is obviously not the way to go. I've harbored grudges, though I'm not sure if that's related to depression or something else.

I've heard meditating is a good thing to try. Just haven't had the motivation to try yet.

Any tips are appreciated.",5,"Fight, insult others, grudges, anger"
"So Tl:dr: used to cut, 2 years later, need to cut more than ever and canât really properly focus on normal things.

I used to cut pretty much every night but I managed to wean myself off of it, but all of a sudden Iâm experiencing the worst need to cut Iâve ever had, I donât have anything to do it with and Iâm doing my best not too, but itâs so hard and Iâm scared of myself.

"Depression itâs a bitch.
Its like there is a constant voice in your head telling you that you are worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, a disappointment that you donât deserve happiness or to be alive but to only feel pain. It makes you feel like you are forever trapped in an abyss with no way of crawling out. Sometimes you can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it always drags you back deeper than youâve gone before and the impossible cycle of escaping begins again. No matter how much you try to escape the darkness, your brain yearns for the dark thoughts to return because it happens so frequently that it becomes the comfort zone for it. 
You begin to doubt everything about yourself; telling yourself whatever you do isnât good enough and you should just stop trying or its worthless to just go on and might be better to just end it all. You feel like you are nothing and will be important to anyone ever and when you are gone everyone will be happier knowing the pathetic failure that they once knew will be gone forever and can no longer fuck up their lives. 
All the smiles on the outside is just a mask to cover how you really feel. You cut because you feel like you deserve the sharp stinging sensation as the blade cuts your arm open and the blood slowing oozing out. Afterwards you are left with scars as a constant reminder of the pain you cause others and how worthless you are. ",5,"worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, disappointment, escaping, pain"

I really donât know where to start but Iâm going to say things are heavy on my chest? Idk I donât feel right, so sorry if this was the wrong place 

I really want help from a doctor or whatever, but I donât know who are they or where, I searched online to see whereâs the best doctors in my country and mostly they werenât in the same city, Iâve gone to a one in my city, itâs supposed to be the best, the appointment cost about 120 dollars maybe *itâs not our official currency I just converted* after waiting literally 7 hours *my appointment supposed to be at 1 pm but Iâve entered 8 pm* the only things she said âitâs not really depression youâre just lonely without friends and without any life activity, and you know about depression and you donât think yours a big dealâ will she said more than that but thatâs the summary of it, Iâve been with her for about 40 minuetsâ¦ I really didnât feel comfortable with her because how busy she isâ¦ she said come to me next week but I didnât go, thatâs all was before 3 weeks or soâ¦ I really donât know what to do and I want someone who I can talk to him, but how? Iâve never experienced anything like thisâ¦
Originally I didnât expect really to go to a therapistâ¦ one of my online friends was really trying to push me to a therapist, but the problem he doesnât live in my country so he doesnât know anyoneâ¦

One of the things that bothered me when the therapist said âyou need friendsâ I already have friends, maybe dozens of themâ¦ online friends, real life friends, and online friends who Iâve met themâ¦ still I feel lonely and lost between themâ¦ Iâm not really the best person between themâ¦ I may be even the worstâ¦ I hate being aliveâ¦

Iâm still 18 people say you havenât experienced life happy things will comeâ¦ but thereâs nothing such as happinessâ¦ finals are next Tuesday and I havenât studied anything yetâ¦ Iâm scared of my parents and donât want to talk with them because I hate themâ¦ I guess having a D isnât badâ¦ I donât want really to liveâ¦ self harm my self every 4 days or so, mostly my legs because I canât let my parents see itâ¦ ugliest person in earthâ¦ tried to suicide two times but I was so scared so bad thing to be aliveâ¦I always cry in the shower because thatâs the only place I can cry without anyone askingâ¦ I have a bad relationship with my brother and sister, none of them like meâ¦ lately I lose my temper so fast, and it annoy meâ¦ not to mention how I hate my body, I used to go the gym daily and lost a lot of wight but Iâve become worse nowâ¦ I donât know about my self Iâm scared of people or talking to new people or even sometimes my friendsâ¦

I used to play video games, having a YouTube channel that was growing really good, I donât feel itâs like accomplishing anything thing itâs just a crap and I feel depressed so I left it nowâ¦ itâs useless to try anything to be honest 

I really hate wasting my time by watching movies or netflix or animeâ¦ and mostly pornâ¦ idk I donât know even my self 

Oh also one more thing in high school I used to get high grades but my parents literally was angry at me for not getting âfull gradesâ idkâ¦

Sorry for the useless post, I really felt depressed and Twitter just suspended my account for being suicidel, and I donât have any place to write to someone without knowing who Iâmâ¦

"It's 4:18 AM as I'm typing this, and I can't sleep. It always takes me a long time to fall asleep, but I couldn't stop thinking and stressing about going back to work after the holidays. Before I knew it, I was about to break down and hyperventilate or cry. I didn't want to wake up my fiancÃ©e, so I got up and I'm now sitting in the livingroom. I'm sorry for whining when I know other people have it much worse than I do, but I need to vent.

I'm almost 30 years old, the son of the owner of a local business in a small town located in QuÃ©bec, Canada. I work for his company, which deals in the sales and repair of commercial and industrial equipment. On paper, I work in sales; in reality, I do practicality everything except for repairs, including but not limited to sales, purchasing, quotations, invoicing, customer service at the counter, on the phone and online, retail item placement and management, parts and equipment research, shipping and receiving, data entry and processing, IT, webmaster, infographics and promotional materials. I also manage our team to some degree and replace the boss and our accounts receivables/payables (his girlfriend) whenever they're away, so I handle late payment complaints even though I can't do anything about it. I'm bilingual and so almost all communications in English are done through me.

That may sound like a fair bit, but I then I also do approximately 75% of one of my colleagues' work because he quite simply can't be arsed to do it. He'll act like he's super busy doing one task whereas I'm typically juggling (no joke) between 5 and 8 tasks at any time, yet I often find him playing solitaire or stretching and loudly yawning at his desk, even when customers are waiting at the counter. A couple summers ago, for two years in a row, when we were the only employees in front, he literally spent hours sleeping at his desk while I alone held the fort throughout our busy seasons. He's approaching retirement age and has been involved with the family for decades; he's not going anywhere.

The foreman in charge of managing repairs and our crew of mechanics routinely vanishes, either going out for errands that take a suspicious amount of time to run, going upstairs to do work for his own company on our dime, spending half an hour in the washroom (upstairs for some reason), running home for one reason or another, or just plain nowhere to be found for no known reason. He fails to properly submit quotations to most customers and fails to properly fill out repair files, so we have to inform customers and make out invoices at the counter when they come in. He also gets me to find parts and pricing as well as place orders for him because he seemingly doesn't feel like doing that himself, maybe because that would cut into his Facebook time. He's typically 15-30 minutes late each morning and afternoon, but he takes off at closing time on the dot, if not a few minutes early. I think it's fair to say that I effectively do about half of his job for him. He's family and is seemingly unfireable for some reason, despite the fact that he's hurting the company badly.

I'll admit I'm usually about 5 minutes late in the morning; I barely get any sleep and never feel rested from any sleep I do get, so it takes a lot of time and motivation to get up and going. That doesn't make it right and I'm ashamed of this bad habit, but I work an extra hour or two everyday, unpaid. I get paid 40 hours a week, but typically work about 50 hours a week. I get reprimanded for being late and for being sick, but unpaid hours go unmentioned. I don't have any fancy diplomas, but I don't think I'd be exaggerating if I said I was a hard worker, maybe even a workaholic.

My father's family is pretty well known locally and is fairly affluent, so customers tend to assume that I'm well off, but they couldn't be further from the truth. I get paid a few dollars more than minimum wage and that's it; no benefits, no commission, no overtime pay, no extra vacation days and no share of the company's profits. I make just enough for my fiancÃ©e and I to survive and afford necessities, and that's about it. Last winter, I couldn't even afford heating, so I had to borrow money to buy fuel oil. Meanwhile, two of my cousins had their houses custom built, one of them spends half his time on vacation with his family and the other's heading to Las Vegas soon, and my other cousin doesn't work but has all her expenditures and house paid for by her dad.

If I dare to complain about my financial difficulties, I get talked down to by my father and his girlfriend and told that I should save up (what is this concept of having leftover money at the end of the month???). They say that my fiancÃ©e should find work, but they don't pay her for the work she does for them. She's a self-employed web designer, artist and programmer; unfortunately, times are tough in that line of business here. She has however done thousands of dollars worth of unpaid work for them, including 3-4 professional websites, and continues to assist them. Any amount she makes goes straight to paying off our debts (credit card) or contributes to paying our expenditures.

My father wants me to buy the business from him so that he has a retirement fund that allows him to keep up his current lifestyle, which includes going on vacation abroad 4-5 times a year, not including camping trips in his RV. However, he refuses to do anything about the obvious issues currently going on and refuses to adapt to the changing market. Suggestions always get turned down and he resists any improvements that I and my only helpful colleague attempt to make. I also routinely have to put up with my father's infantile tantrums and the fact that he doesn't trust me to do anything, resorting to ""micromanaging"". Recently, he doubted my ability to read a PDF in front of a supplier, which was embarassing, and couldn't let me compare invoices (that he asked me to compare) and tried to take over my computer while I was using it so he'd show me how to do my job. It's an extremely stressful work environment, but it's also the way my father has always been with me, and I'm fairly sure that's played a large part in the fact that I have no self-confidence and can't connect with people.

The end result of all the above is that I come home late everyday, exhausted both physically and especially mentally. I barely get any real sleep, my stomach frequently gives me trouble and I suspect that's due to stress, and every little thing feels like a huge challenge. I'm under massive stress because I know very well that if any emergency occurs, if anything breaks or worse, I'm completely unable to afford to solve the issue. Instead, I have to rely on the pity of others, typically my father's if he feels like it (with a healthy dose of acting like he's being generous instead of paying me according to my work), and live with the shame of it. I've always had an exceptional patience with people, but lately the stress has been building up and I've begun snapping at people, worst of all my loving and supportive fiancÃ©e without whom I wouldn't even be around right now.

I've been depressive for over 15 years now and coping with it, but I think this is my lowest point yet. The last week before the holidays, I stood alone in the shipping area and slowly dug a box cutter knife into my left wrist. I was, quite literally, an inch away from ending my life, but it barely left a mark and looks like a skin fold now. I don't want to leave my fiancÃ©e and our cats though, and I especially don't want them to end up in financial trouble. I have a life insurance, but the payout is minimal and they wouldn't cover suicide before at least another year and a half.

I'm going back to work on Monday, less than a week from now. At this point, I only see a few ways out...

- Winning the lottery: Essentially a miracle, but also our only hope of fulfilling any dreams or projects.

- Leaving: Taking a massive risk and leaving my current job, hopefully to work from home online, possibly burning bridges with a family that I do care for despite it all, but also possibly losing everything.

- Staying: Try to last another year and a half in this situation and then examine my options, possibly a rope.

It's now 7:06 AM as I'm typing this on my phone, still sitting in the livingroom. I've stopped panicking and am shaking instead. If you've read this whole thing, I feel sorry for taking that time away from your life and for whining so much, but I'm also thankful that you cared enough to finish. I'm not looking for a solution, I simply needed to vent.

That said, please hit me up if you're looking for someone to work online remotely.",5,"Sleep, never feel rested, reprimanded, sick, exhausted, physically, mentally"
"Just to give some background, I've felt pretty depressed for most of my adult/adolescent life (I'm 21 now) but have never felt able to talk to anyone about it (not even family or close friends).  I have days where I'm in a slightly more positive mood, but generally I just feel pretty apathetic about everything, lethargic and extremely self-critical to the point where it stops me doing things.  I don't really have physical symptoms but being this low obviously causes me to neglect my health quite a bit.  My environment and lifestyle certainly have an impact; I recently moved in with my aunt who has very little understanding of depression (and just emotions generally), and I'm living in a place where I don't really know anyone.

Anyway I took an NHS depression self-assessment recently and the results suggested that I should go and see my GP.  However, I'm seriously doubting whether to do it, I feel like I'd just be a waste of their time.  Besides I know that there's a chance that they might suggest taking anti-depressants, and I'm a little reluctant about that given everything that I've heard and read about them and their side effects.  

Sorry for the long post, guess I just needed to vent, but any advice would be really appreciated.",5,"feel pretty apathetic about everything, lethargic and extremely self-critical "

My mind is drifiting away in a shore of thoughts,
Everything sprayed on a piece of paper in form of a thousand dots,

What should I do with my life?
Get rich, some childrens and a beautiful wife?

But the question is how did I deserve that?
Living in the sewers like an ugly rat,

Waiting for a predator to end me,
'Cause even on the brightest days darkness is all I see,

This darkness feels like a home somehow,
I try to get to it but not now,

Sometimes I am standing on the edge,
Looking back to my life as if it was a sketch,

Maybe I should just erase it,
Throw it in a glowing firepit,

I know I will end forgotten,

"I got in two car-totaling wrecks in the final two weeks of 2018.

Firstly, I rear-ended someone hard enough to total my mother's car (it was still completely drivable but FUCK ME, right Geico? :); this happened the 19th.

Then, I got a rental. And took my girlfriend of two years out to dinner on NYE, because that's our anniversary date. Silly me. Someone t-boned my rental car at 55-60 mph and completely destroyed both cars. Thank the fucking lord no one involved sustained any serious injuries, but me and my girlfriend are in pain and quite frankly, while I'm glad she's alive and ultimately okay, I wish I was dead.

I'm on the hook for some serious fucking cash right now. I don't want to do this but I know I have to. For everyone else I've just been putting aside my fear and pain and anguish and self-doubt and I've been putting it into my work, finding extra hours and working for bonus etc. Hopefully I'll find a way out of this.

Sorry for rambling. I don't want to tell this to anyone else. They just won't listen because both the accidents were my fault, so maybe I really am just a shit driver despite an otherwise squeaky-clean driving record of four years. I don't know what sign the lord, should he exist, is trying to send me. Maybe it's just to stay off of the road.",5,"both the accidents were my fault, so maybe I really am just a shit driver"
"All that I've been able to feel is beginning to turn into feeling nothingness. Even when depressed there are still ups and downs but now I am starting to just feel nothing. Blandness. Stale. Everything devoid of any meaning really at all. I'm not suicidal and I don't self-harm. There's just no motivation to accomplish anything and I can't really see the point of anything. I find myself staring at things and thinking about nothing, whereas my mind used to spend a lot of time thinking about everything. Does anyone else feel like this? Sometimes, like now, I realize it's happening and it makes me feel worse to know it's happening but sometimes it really doesn't even bother me because sometimes feeling nothing can be better than feeling anything, ya know? I don't know.",5,"just no motivation to accomplish anything, can't really see the point of anything"
"I've always loved helping others, whether it means I'm there to talk to them and listen to their concerns, or doing something for them. It makes me feel like I'm contributing something to society, and it is especially rewarding to see when I've helped make their day better somehow. However, lately I've been feeling this is my only good quality, being a utility to others. People only keep me around and talk to me because they know I would always agree to helping them out. They tolerate all my other horrible qualities because the help is worth more to them. Recently, I sent an email to my boss (who I'm pretty close with) with an organized spreadsheet for a work task (something I had not been asked to do, and was my boss's job), and they replied telling me ""You're amazing! Thanks for making everything so organized for me. You are such a gem"". Comments that like sting for me rather than lift me up because they just further validate my belief that I am only a utility to others, and that if I weren't useful, they would ice me out in a second. I still try to do helpful things for others, but lately it's made me feel more horrible than good.",5,They tolerate all my other horrible qualities because the help is worth more to them
Im so fucked. I have anxiety to the point i feel i have paranoia and it leads to depression. And i just wanna be normal for once. I wanna actually live. Instead of constantly think about the bad about myself and how horrible i am. What can help me? Therapy? Meds? Can you guys help me out?,5, constantly think about the bad about myself and how horrible i am

"Iâm in a dark, deep pit in the ground. Itâs deep enough so I can just barely here the outside world up above me, but not much. Thereâs a ladder too. Sometimes, I climb up the ladder to peek out of the pit and see whatâs going on outside. But usually when I do, it starts pouring rain, or a storm starts heading for me. I feel it in my stomach. A lurching, swaying pendulum that swings back and forth. It swings, and I fall down the ladder. I remember that I havenât earned the outside world. I remember that the people out there hate me and rightly should. I remember how selfish it was of me to climb the ladder in the first place as if the world out there wanted anything to do with me.

sometimes it swings a different way, and I feel angry. Angry at myself for not just leaving the pit altogether and facing the world bravely. Angry at the people who hurts me. The pendulum has so much momentum, it slams into my stomach, sending me tumbling off the ladder again, and I hit the freezing cold dirt at the bottom. But I shouldâve known better, no one up there cares about me unless theyâre somehow benefiting from my being around. When I run out of shoulders to be cried on, spare bedrooms for people to stay in, home-cooked food or money, Iâm dispensable. No, less than dispensable- a nuisance. A fly in someoneâs car, or gum on someoneâs shoe. I want to scream but the outside world canât hear me, just as I can barely hear them.

Sometimes, people come by the pit and drop in food as if I were a zoo animal. But I like the food. It helps, and when my stomach is full the pendulum has no room to swing. I feel brave again, climb the ladder up out of the pit, and sometimes I even camp outside the pit with a fire and tent, and sometimes people have fun being with me, I think.

The food comes in little orange bottles with strange names but it still helps. It makes it easier to breathe if I do fall into the pit again.
I hope one day, I can leave the pit and go back home.",5,deep enough so I can just barely here the outside world up above me
Its just so hard to be alive. Everytime i think im out of it it comes back hard. Its been 2 months now. I've never been depressed before and now for 2 months i can't shake it. I don't think I'll ever be alright again.,5,"now for 2 months i can't shake it, I don't think I'll ever be alright again."
"I've been on therapy and taking meds (Lexapro 10 mg). I've been having less mood swings, it's easier to sleep and I don't have crying breakdowns anymore. Still, when I think about death or not existing anymore, it seems like such a comforting thought, like a relief from all my pain and fears - even thought it's been less hard to deal with them, it's still hard. I don't think about it all the time, but when I do, the idea of no existence feels very tempting. When I wake up, I always ended up sleeping again or just staying more in bed. Even if I get out of bed and have an ok day and all, I still hesitate to do so, because hiding from the world in my bed feels like the best choice as a first thought, when I have just waken up. 
But it's still a better place than I was before, so I guess I've got that going for me. Better than nothing.

",5,"don't think about it all the time, but when I do, the idea of no existence feels very tempting"
"I do. But I gotta do it again, it's been awhile.

Basically:

1.) Horrible genetics. Parents shouldn't have bred. I have several life threatening issues that my parents ignored the obvious early signs of, so my life is severely shortened. And I can barely walk.

(No real solution for this one. Besides, you know, ending things myself before I become trapped in my body.)

2.) Shitty in-laws. It's VERY bad. Spent almost a decade patiently convincing my SO that they hate him. Because they do.

(Either I keep trying to convince him to stop feeling obligated for people who mistreat him ..or I leave.)

3.) Poverty level.

(Randomly succeed at life and afford to live WOW SO EASY AMIRITE. My solution is to keep leaving below my means. Start gambling safely and see what extra money I can come up with.)

4.) No dependable friends. I talk to people easily. Most suck. Most enjoy suffering and pity points. I want people around me where we all want to SOLVE our depression/etc.

(Keep trying to establish long-term friendship with people. It's basically endless, time-consuming shopping that we all have to do.)

I've been depressed for about 20 years now. I'm pretty good at distracting myself and finding happiness in the tiniest things. But damn, the past two years are really grinding to a halt.",5,become trapped in my body
"I want to be happy again. To enjoy something, anything. To be content with my life.

I'm not afraid anymore. Fuck this world and everything in it. I'm getting no where. I have the noose tied.,5,getting no where
"I don't know if I'm depressed or not, but I do know that ever since October 12th my emotional state has progressively gotten worse. I don't know how much detail we are meant to go into, but that day was I suppose, borderline traumatic... I still remember it vividly. Crying on and off afterwards. 

Since then, I've had okay days where I was relatively happy. There's days when I don't cry, and others where I cry a few times... 

I don't have that much self confidence... I draw and I'm supposively smart, considering my 4. 0 GPA, but... I guess I just compare myself to people. 
I'm not smart, my brother is way smarter. 
I'm not a good artist, just an amateur trying their best. 
I'm not pretty, I have pimples and I don't smile enough. 
I have thoughts like that... People are their own worst critic, right?... but, I don't know if that's necessarily true. I'm overly sensitive, I've noticed. If anyone yells at me or nitpicks my flaws, I'll go off and cry, or at least feel like crying. An insult isn't enough to hurt me much, it's when its personal, Especially when it's my close family and friends saying it.... 

I've almost lost my best friend twice over arguments we had. She's clinically depressed. I can't help her. But I keep trying. During the first argument, I experienced my first and hopefully last panic attack. I've had more common anxious feelings sense. Both times I sobbed for many, many minutes. The pain and worry was unbearable. I didn't want to lose her because of something I did, especially. 

I often blame myself for the things that go wrong. I apologize a lot. I'm too irritable. I'm always tired. It seems like my memory has gotten worse. I'm jumpy, for some reason, especially with loud noises. My drawing hobby, talking with friends, and the internet are mostly the only things that make me happy. But it never lasts. I just wish it would... 

I am a Christian and so are my parents. I try and bring up my feelings with my mother but she insists that it's hormones and I should pray more. I thought she'd understand because of what her life had been like. I thought she'd understand since she's experienced anxiety and depression first hand. Again, I don't know if I have anything wrong with me. I haven't been anywhere. I've asked her to take me somewhere but she says I'm being a hypochondriac and believing myself into a depression. I don't think so. I just want to not hurt, is that so much to ask for? I love her, but I wish she would understand.... 

I've been sensitive to arguments since an argument began this whole ordeal and has caused problems in my closet friendship. 

I also suspect social anxiety is a possibility, but I'm really not a professional. I don't know, I just know that it effects my social life in several ways. 

When I get sad, as I often do when I'm not distracted, it hurts a lot. Physically, too. Like.. In my chest or stomach. It hurts so much. I can't handle it very well, or anything for that matter. 

I don't believe I'm suicidal, but... There have been the occasional thought of wanting to die. I'm not sure though. I want to live. But... Not like this. Not suffering... 

Anyways, here's my rambling about my feelings. If you guys could help me understand them better and maybe give advice, I'd appreciate it. 

Thank you for your time. ",5,"often blame myself for the things that go wrong, I apologize a lot, I'm too irritable, I'm always tired, It seems like my memory has gotten worse,I'm jumpy, for some reason, especially with loud noises"
"I don't see how it's supposed to help me feel or think any better. I already know that the way I think about things causes me to be depressed, but somehow I'm okay with it. It's difficult to explain. I AM my thoughts, and my thoughts aren't irrational. I'm not depressed because my ""brain is lying to me"". Why do I sit around not doing anything? Because at my core, I don't feel an intrinsic desire to actually do something that doesn't bring me immediate physical pleasure. I don't reap the intangible rewards of completing goals or learning new things. I just don't care for it. That's a fact. I guess you could chalk me up to a whining child since I clearly don't want to push myself out of the mental rut, and with that I would agree. My values don't exist anymore. I'm a shell of a person and I don't care enough to change that. That's the thing everyone who wants to help just doesn't understand. They can't help me due to philosophical reasons. There's not a thing anyone could tell me that would make me feel as if anything mattered. There's not a thing I could tell myself to change that either. I could mechanically flip the switch on that thought so to speak, but I wouldn't FEEL it. Going with it trying to fake it till I DO feel it doesn't work because it's not GENUINE. That's the thing about major depression. It is a rational reaction and it is a genuine reaction. When someone comes out of it, they don't become ""themselves"" again; they were always themselves. They were able to flip the switch and FEEL it. This, I cannot do, and not because I think I can't.",5,There's not a thing anyone could tell me that would make me feel as if anything mattered
....and now that escape from reality makes me feel a little closer to normal i spent the first 32 years of my life never experiencing depression but now i wonder if i did and i just wasnt bad enough that videogames wouldn't alleviate it completely. I don't understand myself anymore.,5,now that escape from reality makes me feel a little closer to normal
