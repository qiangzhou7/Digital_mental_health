"I have no motivation to live. I don't see myself getting anywhere in life. I don't have any skills, talents, accomplishments, or any real hobbies. I hate that I'm so stupid, so selfish, so socially incompetent, so incapable of performing even the most basic tasks. I hate being a complete burden on everybody. My friends don't seem to care at all about me, and my family doesn't understand my depression at all. Hell, I don't even know if I can understand it myself either. It's hard to articulate, but the best I can put it is that half the time, I feel like I'm just lying to myself and using depression as an excuse to be like this. My parents have always told me that I shouldn't even be depressed, considering how easy I have life compared to others, and as much as I hate to say it, I agree. As much as I really just want to fix everything, I feel like I just want to kill myself. But I can't do it. I don't know why, but I can't. No matter how badly I want to do it, I can't bring myself to do it. Maybe I'll just have to learn to accept living like this.",5,"have no motivation to live.

"I can't fucking sleep at all and I can't stop crying out of anxiety. I spent the past seven hours googling and getting worked up over a stupid medical procedure I need to get and that then morphed into me wanting to die. I'm anxious as hell and can't stop thinking about it. 

What's the point in living life if everything causes you pain? What did I do to deserve this? I didn't ask to be thrust into this fucking world without any say. I can't stop thinking about how life is just too painful to not be worth it at all. It's not, really. It sucks that I'd hurt so many people if I died, and it makes me angry that I have this shit holding me back from ending it all. I know they'd feel a certain way. But what about my feelings?! Why should I push through just so everyone around me can feel okay?",5,what's the point in living life if everything causes you pain
"I just really donât know what to do anymore. My mind keeps trying to kill me while my body is trying to keep me alive. Iâm starting to not feel anything at all, except being empty and depressed. Then, I get more depressed because I feel empty and I feel more empty because Iâm depressed. Iâve asked for help. Iâve asked for so much help. But no one sees it, even the people who are payed to care. I have to keep talking myself off this ledge and I donât even know why I do it. Iâve lost everything. My family, my true friends, my baby. Everything that I care about either leaves or dies. And Iâve become such a cold, empty person because of it.

"I was sitting in my room just trying to deal with life, and all the shit that has been thrown at me in the last few years when out of nowhere there was this flash of memory, and I remembered that this isn't the first time things have been bad, and that things have actually been far, far worse. And I remembered that all those years ago, music was life. For a brief moment, I remembered what it was like to feel. For real music, honest music, you have to be able to feel. I remembered that I would drift through the day back then so numb to the world, but when I got home, plugged up to the amp, and put on my 100 dollar studio quality headphones and magically I could feel. I wanted to remember that, so it's just what I did. Been a *long* time so I had to do some digging, and almost got stuck in the memories held by all the crap in storage, but I found it. The main volume dial needs to be replaced, and I had to rewire the speaker to the amp, but it all still works. And I played. Nothing fancy, just tuning, and some finger exercises, and other ""warmup"" stuff. I can't really remember how to play much else right now, but I did the thing, and it was great. I think I smiled for the first time in weeks. ",5,"sitting in my room just trying to deal with life, and all the shit that has been thrown at me in the last few years"

"Here we are again, in the middle of the night with nothing but the thoughts of failure, loneliness and fear of the future. I've been here so often over the last 10 years it feels like home. And has it really been 10 years? Unfortunately, yes. 10 years of depression. 10 years of anxiety issues interfering with my daily life. 5 Years out of high school and all I can count is the number of things I've fucked up. Dropped out of college. Been through 6 under-paid jobs that had me working 12 or more hours a day to exhaustion and panic attacks. That one really kills me. For the longest time panic attacks weren't something I had to worry about. I had maybe 3 from age 13 to 18. Then retail happened to me and I started having one a month. Then it turned into 1 a week. Then it turned into having problems leaving my house and jumping at the sound of a car starting. I suppose I've worked through part of that. I don't jump at everything anymore, and I managed to get out of the house some but being in public for any extended period of time still makes me nervous. I ran out of friends somewhere 2 years ago when I realized that my entire friend-group only hung around because I was a convenient source for weed and car rides. The last roomates I had were more my children than friends, since I had to constantly pick up after them to keep some organization in my living space, and constantly woke me up in the middle of the night bringing groups of drunk people over. I went straight after that. No drugs, no alcohol, no smoking. I still miss smoking. It gave me some amount of comfort in hard times, but you can't keep doing a thing that's killing you. Or so they say. I still have the urge to live, otherwise I would have kept the habit even when I started coughing up blood most mornings.
But the period of severe anxiety and depression before I did give up everything drained what meager savings I had accumulated. I was so afraid to leave the house that I quit my job, ordered delivery every day, and tried to drown my sorrows in alcohol and weed. There went 2k in a matter of months. What a waste. I could have bought into Bitcoin with that money. 
My mom had recently moved back into the state. I had no idea until she showed up on my doorstep every other day when my phone service went out. She helped me get out of the shit house I was staying in, gave me a place to stay and food for the last month, but I can tell her patience is running thin. In the beginning it was all ""OMG let me help you!"" ""We'll take you to a therapist"". That lasted all of a week before it was on to the same drivel I got growing up about getting a job. Meanwhile, I can't get even get McDonald's to call me back anymore. -.- I don't really think I need to talk to a therapist. Drugs aren't going to improve my situation all that much. Getting a call back from even the lowest of the pizza delivery places around here would help. A lack of inflation driving school tuitions and hence my student loans sky high would help. But drugs? I doubt it. If the drugs that helped me decide to STOP doing drugs didn't help, then the one's to dull my mind and make me ok with slaving for 12 hours a day on a wage that won't pay for an apartment without room-mates sure as hell aren't. But that comes too close to playing the victim for comfort. I don't want to be a victim, I don't want sympathy, I just want to do something productive that makes me not feel like shit, and lets me afford my own space. Does that sound like too much to ask? Really, someone should tell me because from my POV it doesn't, but I may not be thinking in the clearest terms anymore. My experiences of the last 5 years certainly seem to point in this direction. But whatever the case may be, thanks for reading, if you have. It's a release of some sort to put my thoughts down on paper.",5,"thoughts of failure, loneliness and fear of the future.

"I sometimes wish the world would end. Still here, I am awake, haunted by the sound of a subtle whisper. Though there's nothing left, cities sleeping that never before have heard rest, there's a feeling yearning; aching, hurting inside like pressure in an ear. If there was nobody, would you know? Recalling events of loss, you remember voices you have once heard before this time of nothingness disappearing after their loss... Soon enough you hear the news.
Am I insane? Who is this? Why is this happening? The subtle comfort of solidarity, though terrifying, luls me into comfort, still I hear this voice....
Still here alone..., where? 
We soon make plans.
Rendezvous. 
Nobody cares when. We have all the time in the world right? 
Paris. France. That's the destination.
The trip was not difficult, just long. Boats and gas are plentiful. Anyone... All two of them could break into the library now... There are so many...
Finally here... I wait. 
Nobody. It never was... I was wrong. I have learned nothing. I still wait and look but there's nobody in sight... I guess this really is real life...


I used to have this wish, and that some way, some how, I would meet her... Still getting played time and time again... I don't think it would end the way I hoped. We wouldn't meet. We wouldn't find love. There would be no hope, Or it would all be insanity from the start",5,"Nobody cares when, We have all the time in the world right"
"I don't know where else I can go to talk about all of this, so here goes I guess. I'm a 19 year old male and I feel like my life is already over. My dad refuses to apologize for running out on us when I was 3 years old; my mother says he only picked me up twice from the time I was born until I could walk. 

My first memory is of my older sisters begging me to eat my dinner because the sun was setting and we didn't have any power, and I had to eat so we could go to bed when darkness came. I was 3 at the time, and they were 12 and 9 years old, respectively. My dad repeatedly cheated on my mom while she was deployed overseas and spent weeks at a Motel 6 across town, leaving us to fend for ourselves, and we would have starved had my oldest sister not called the school and gotten one of her teachers to come give us groceries to hide from him. We were afraid to call the police because he might come back and beat us or worse. We were just kids, I don't know what else we could have done and it's in the past now so who cares. 

The few times he did come back, he would take away the groceries we had and take all the money in my sister's piggy bank. 
Over the past decade my siblings and I have rolled through the years binging on drugs, buying from the internet and selling them to get my next high. My nephew was taken by CPS when my sister almost died from a week-long binge on meth. 

My stepfather is an idiot but means well, and he's about the best I could ask for in a time like this, but as much as I try, I can't fill the void my dad left. He tries to talk to me now, but refuses to apologize or even acknowledge the terrible things he did. I don't think I can ever forgive him, and I don't know what to do.
I don't want to go back to the drugs, but it would be so easy to run down to the supermarket and get a bottle of cough syrup for under 5 bucks to make me feel a little numb for a few hours. 

I tried to kill myself a month ago and spent 3 days in a psych ward which helped only in the way that I would do anything to get out of there, even lying about my mental state in order to get discharged as soon as possible. I've been prescriped antidepressants and xanax and i have a solid couple of best friends that I'm closer to than anyone in my family, but they're going back to college at the end of this winter break and I'll be stuck in my shitty hometown with no prospects for the future.
I worked as an EMT for a few months after getting my certification about a year ago, but I saw some shit that still haunts me every night.

I don't know what to do, where to turn, or who can help me. The suicide hotline tells me that they have to move on to another caller after 10 minutes of talking and I don't want to give them my address or they'll call the police like last time. I'm scared, and alone, and I don't know what to do.",5,"older sisters begging me to eat my dinner because the sun was setting and we didn't have any power, and I had to eat so we could go to bed when darkness came.

"Dealing with my friend's suicide has gotten ... Really bad. To the point of not eating very much for the last month or so. My parents had come over to help me clean on Saturday and I had a headache so I could do little to help, but I tried my best. Tylenol didn't work. My dad ended up getting upset that there's ""always something wrong with me."" He also said a bunch of other bullshit stuff about depression after I had to remind him what I'm dealing with and why I am physically not well at the moment. Ended up locking myself in the bathroom, my cat worrying outside, until they left.

My mom texted me later that she had a talk with him that depression affects everyone differently, and he needs to be more understanding. I explained a little more about my dismal sleeping and eating habits, and clarifying my seemingly growing problems. Fine, we're good. Still pissed because he comes off as very heartless when it comes to depression. He's never been there himself, but my mom has, obviously I have, and their other kid (who I do not associate with for unrelated reasons) also has.

Today my mom came by again, and she keeps going on about ""why don't I do x or y"" and I explain that everything feels like it's lost meaning in all of this. 

And then she pulls the most bullshit line. Again. I have called her out so many times over the last almost 6 years, and I just don't understand how she can still say shit like this after having dealt with depression herself.

""Don't be depressed, you just have to think positive.""

Fucking wish i'da thought of that 6 years ago. Or 5, or less. /S

I'm on celexa but it's not working, waiting for my doctor to get my records from my old therapist so I can finish paperwork for a psychhealth evaluation. My hobbies bring me no joy, I had to quit one job, my other boss has made me feel absolutely unappreciated as an employee. At least my appetite is coming back so I'm getting back to.... Sort of normal... I just don't know how to deal with her when she does this. It's not the first time, and I'm sure it won't be the last, and I always explain very clearly why that's just simply not possible but... It just never really sets in. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated at this point. I'm lost enough, I don't need to deal with this too right now.",5,"Dealing with my friend's suicide has gotten, Really bad, To the point of not eating "

"Iâm suffering depression and anxiety, and Iâm just ... sick of it. I was doing well, hanging out with my dad ... then my friend asked me how work was going and I just started crying again. 

This is so not me! Iâm not a crier! Iâm someone strong who can fucking do what needs to be done, when it needs to be done. Iâm so sick of feeling weak and vulnerable. This is not who I am.

And then when I went to acupuncture today. Again. Totally fine, toddling through life, walk into the acupuncturistâs office, he asks me how Iâm going, and ... bam. Tears. 

I donât mind crying when thereâs a cause. And to be honest, I actually donât usually cry when there IS a cause. So to be crying when there isnât a viable cause ... it just feels pathetic.

I had thoughts of suicide while at the acupuncturist. I donât, usually, and I know that by putting it out there like this, thereâs a greater chance that I wonât - I wouldnât, anyway - but ... itâd be a lot easier for me. Not anyone else, I know. But itâd just stop everything for me. 

All I could think was life would be easier if I was a crow.  

Iâm self medicating with St Johnâs Wort, Vitamins, Fish oil, turmeric and Chinese roots ... and most of the time Iâm all right, but then - out of nowhere - tears.

To be fair, my shrink didnât say or do anything out of line. She was courteous and patient, as usual. However as I sat there, I just felt very pointless. Iâve felt like this all my life, whatâs there to change it? Whatâs there to look to look forward to?

Eat healthy and exercise! I did. I started at 240 lbs. Got down to 180. Then I went on meds and went back to 220. 

Talk to people! I did. Now they don't talk to me or they're weird around me.

Get professional help! I did. They either didn't know what to do or they told me to go talk to someone else in my government's healthcare.

Take time for yourself! Ok I'm staring at a wall and my thoughts are racing now what?

Journal! Tried that, ended up with me just bitching about my problems to myself. Wasn't very helpful

Focus on your hobbies! Hard to do that when nothing interests me anymore.

Make goals and follow through! Ok I did them now what?

Take medication! I did. For almost a year. All it did was either do nothing, give me horrible anxiety in which I couldn't move, or didn't help and just made me gain weight.

Also great to hear that depression never really goes away it just gets easier to manage. What's the point? Living life for the sake of living just seems pointless to me. There are so many people who'll say there's so much to live for or that it gets better. What if it doesn't?

Sometimes i would rather not exist or atleast, have a purpose a drive to live, for i always feel numb, there are brief moments were i can have good times but it takes all my being to maintiain. 

I sit here  wondering if there will be any true enjoyment in life, from what im surrounded by the drivel of normal life, is that what my fate is? a life of mundane bullshit of pointless relationships of sitting around doing nothing at all and even when something good comes along eventually it leaves that is the duality of life misery and happiness both ever flowing rivers which is not a bad thing, if it were not  for the fact that the ""good times"" seem to feel empty still  in the end there is still no reason no purpose we exist just waiting for the day we die.

In all things i thought had meaning, things that i thought i had pleasure in doing feel more and more empty to the point where i dont think i truly enjoy anything. So where does that leave me with no purpose no enjoyment just the goings of noraml life that is what i have to look foward to? in a sense that is hell, i can enjoy it for a while but not much longer than a month for i cannot exist just to enjoy life and have fun or some bullshit about finding love, pfff  that crap never lasts most of us fear loneliness, that is why we marry or spend long times with one person but eventually you will get tired of that person or they will lose their interest.

I have no idea why i feel the way i do, as if im completely blank that the idea of continuing this drives me insane i could not endure this. In the end i still do not understand how i feel im lost utterly searching for reason, but i doubt i will find it in this existence.

I'm much more ready to get happy seeing something than I was, and maybe this was due to some desparation to get out of the vantablack-coated hellhole that I fell into, but slowly I started to look at life as string of vignettes, with a moment of quirky charm thrown in sporadically. I'm still far from escaping this pit, but were it not for moments like those, I'd have stopped this nonsense a long while ago.

Rejection is a bummer, but if you also get the occasional date from trying, then it makes up for it. The problem with that is that the people like me who only ever get rejected feel even more like shit and don't want to put themselves up to that repeatedly.

It all feels so pointless to me now. Sure, it'll be depressing knowing that everyone else will be out tonight having fun, but it's all so superficial; get drunk, yell happy near years, feel like crap in the morning and resume regular life the next day. No matter what I chose to do I'll still be depressed. I don't want to celebrate with strangers, but I also don't want to be alone tonight..",5,"all be *normal* its all so superficial, feel like crap in the morning and resume regular life"
"Is there anyone else here that has so much but doesn't feel like they really deserve any of it?

Personally I've got a few really close friends from home and college, a great GPA, a good job, a family that probably isn't as bad as I think it is, and we're getting by financially, even if it is a bit tough.

I think about my situation compared to some of the others I read on here and I question why I'm so depressed. Even with all that I have, I feel like I don't deserve what I have, and someone who can actually enjoy them should have them instead. Thinking that I'm the one who gets it instead just makes me feel worse about it really

I wanna just throw it all away, disappear without anyone knowing where I went but I know that won't fix anything ",5,"dont deserve what I have,wanna throw it all away, disappear without anyone knowing where I went"
"Someone loved me and I think I loved them, I was so happy, then she was gone and I was awake.       
I laid in bed for more then an hour trying to just fall back asleep, I wasn't tired, I just wanted to go back.          
I can't even remember her name.  Seems so stupid that I would care, she was just a dream.      
I've never felt like that before, didn't even know I could, doubt I ever will again.        

Now that I'm awake it seems like a nightmare rather then a dream.

"I've only ever had one friend that I can tell anything to, but I've always hid my depression and various other mental issues from her. But she knew something was up because sometimes I go weeks to months where I don't leave my room more than once a day and barely eat or drink don't talk to anyone and lose whatever job I have at that time. And finally last night I told her everything and she was the first person to not down play my problems or end the friendship on the spot. She told me that she will be there to support me through everything and even told me she liked me a lot. But I'm hesitant to start a relationship because every relationship I've been in has ended after a month at most because of the way I am and I don't want to lose her as a friend. I do feel a lot better having finally told someone about my depression and other shit. I might ask her out anyway because she is the first girl to fully accept who I am.",5,"first person to not  downpaly my problems or end relationship, "

"Well, fuck you! To be alone in the crowds better than to be alone (to be left, to not try for the other, but not to choose loneliness), to be better than to be with people who do not understand you; as if it had to be with those people. If they do not understand you, then go, go the fuck away, come along, be like me. What is holding you? I tell you what it is that scares you; to live my lonely life in the pile of meat surrounding you. It 's not hard to be alone, believe me, you just need to be yourself. It is very insincere when you stay in that crowd and whine about staying in that crowd and praise my loneliness. Fuck you one more time.

I am not sincere too. Sometimes I wanna get in between that rotten, stinky pile of meat you've stayed in between and feel safe. I can not live loneliness properly. 

To be alone is like a suicidal person stays between death and life. Those who dreaming death, those who see death as salvation, those who want to die think about that because their hope is fading. But the hope that has been left in his pocket allows him to continue for a while. There are also similar hopes in the people that alone. The lonely people waits for someone, wants to find someone. As long as you remain alone you will lose hope, knowing someone, having the ability to communicate with someone. The prospects of getting rid of loneliness are weak as long they are alone.

The only person who is obsessed with death is the only one who has a chance to get away from loneliness and to survive as long as he has spent time there. The ability to survive. It has not been too long.

sorry for my english. it is not my first language and i've learned it myself, so it's not good, bad actually... whatever, i hope you'll understand what i meant.

"I'm ending 2016 having to fight through a situation I have no energy to deal with. I am being victimised once more and have little hope of getting help, yet I have no choice but to fight.

"Hi there. My name is Jonah I'm 17 and I struggle a bit with depression. Not as bad as it used to be but it comes and goes, especially in the winter. These are some things that happen to me when I have a bad day, and please, if you expierence the same or have anything to say about these, let me know: I usually want to eat salty foods. I don't get extra hungry, but I crave chips and popcorn. Stuff like that. I masterbate a lot more. I don't necessarily want to sleep more, but I like to lay in bed more. I get antisocial. I get the urge to start using again, although I know that if I do, it will only make things worse so I don't. I take comfort in smaller things. Usually stuff like videogames and youtube videos. Anyone have anything similar?",5," I get antisocial.I don't get extra hungry, but I crave chips and popcorn.  I masterbate a lot more."
"Possible triggers coming up.

I've built myself into a robust, hermit, cold, sociopathic character, but every once in a while who I would have been if my life went differently bursts through. I'm known for being extremely isolated in my family, and I have forced myself to be okay with being lonely, and it worked, it's my preferred state and I love it. But sometimes something goes off and I just realize I need people. I crave people. Therapists struggle to understand me(do you have any idea what an alienating feeling that is? This guy is supposed to fucking know, and he's looking at me like I'm a nut job), what about friends? What about a girlfriend? I failed high school, I'm alone, I have no skills nor do I want any, I don't believe in school in the first place, I don't believe in dedicating my life to some worthless fucking job, fuck that. I didn't ask to live and I'm not okay with the way I'm being forced to live. All this stress people talk about is stress that was created and it doesn't need to be there, and old fucks tell you 'when you grow up you'll understand' like I don't understand it, you're just accepting it, you're not okay with it, it doesn't make anymore sense, you just conformed and that's not okay, you're putting your ass in the air and you're just accepting that you're getting fucked, and you're okay with that because it's easy. I don't want to conform. I don't believe in this, I'm not built for this, I want to die. I am afraid, I'm alone, and I fear that I won't last any longer. I'm scared. I'm fucking frightened. I'm sick of people trying to push 'meaning' down your throat. Not a thing means anything and I will never not believe that. I don't give a fuck about what valuable skills you think I need to have. I want to live the way I want to live, and there's nothing wrong with that, and I'll never not feel like that and because of this I'm going to die, either soon and painfully. Or I'm gonna accept it and fucking kill myself, because I WILL NOT be able to cope with it for long. 

Edit: I feel obligated to just mention this. If you feel like dieing, get yourself help. If you feel without meaning, look into existential nihilism. Please don't kill yourself, and try to become happier. Get help.

"This is the first time I'm making the conscious effort to enjoy myself rather than wallow in my depression and self pity because nobody invited me to a NYE party. I've never before taken steps towards self care so that in itself is an accomplishment and I'm proud of it. Will I be back to my self destructive and self pitying ways soon? Who knows, but for just one day I'm going to allow myself to take care of me and if you've been looking for any encouragement or a sign to do the same then hopefully this is it. I've decided nobody gives a shit that you're laying in bed crying and the only person who can make me happy is myself if I just allow myself to enjoy things. Instead of purposely listening to that sad music when I'm already sad, I'm going to listen to my dumb 70's upbeat playlist.


Today is no different than any other day except for the fact that society deems it the start of a new year when in reality time is just a construct. The idea that you need to be around other people on NYE in order to have fun is also another construct. The sun will still set and rise like it does everyday.


If you give in to looking at social media you will see people getting drunk and what appears to be having fun. Realize that yes, some of these people are genuinely out having a good time, but a majority of it is making things appear better than they really are. They're not posting pictures of people sitting on a chair scrolling through their phones (which is what happens for 90% of the time at the majority of parties), they're posting pictures where everyone came together and posed like they're having fun and shit is wild and right after the camera shutter goes off they're back to scrolling on their phones. Some of them are probably feeling fed up and wishing it was over. Some of them probably feel just as alone as they do when there's nobody around (and that's truly a worse feeling). I know this was true back when I used to get invited to parties. You, on the other hand, are at home surrounded by things you can enjoy. Movies, TV, video games, books, hobbies like drawing, you name it. Would you really be happier at that party?


Anyway, I'm going to wrap this post up because, like I said, I have a day of fun shit to do by myself. If you're not ready to take the step towards self care, I get it. I've been depressed for a hell of a long time and never taken this step. But today I woke up and decided to do it. It'll happen for you eventually if it's not happening now. Happy NYE guys.



My plan as well as tips for tonight:


- Starting off eating a nice pot brownie that I've been saving (Also for the first time, I'm getting high because it's enjoyable, not as an escape)


- Watch a movie (Never seen The Wolf of Wall Street and I think I'm going to try it out tonight)


- Watch TV shows (I've been watching The Office lately)


- Play a video game (I've been into Battlefield 1 and Civ 6 lately)


- Depending on how high I get, watch Planet Earth (On a more serious note, shit puts things into perspective and reminds you how fucking cool the planet where we live is. People might suck sometimes, but nature is beautiful as fuck. The colors and scenery are amazing but I'll probably be high as shit crying when I see the predator killed the prey only to bring the food back to its own babies)


- Fireworks get to me pretty badly, so if they get loud I'm going to put headphones in


- Limit social media use (I know I won't be able to stop myself from checking, so I'll just remind myself of what I typed earlier when I do)


- Eat good food (Try making something new or order out your favorite food)


- Give my dog a hug and a treat at midnight


- Get a good rest and wake up tomorrow like I do everyday

I advise you to make a list like I did and if at any point you feel yourself drifting into self pity or whatever else, try to read it and do something on it to get you back on track to a good night :)",5,The idea that you need to be around other people on NYE in order to have fun is also another construct.they're posting pictures where everyone came together and posed like they're having fun 
"What if I have an amazing family, and amazing boyfriend, amazing friends, amazing schooling, amazing financial status. 

What if I have no reason to be depressed? 

All of my family is coming over this afternoon to enjoy the night and I'm crying in my room, afraid and tired. 

But all I can think about is how tired I am of life. How nothing is bringing me joy anymore. I have no reason to live. 

Is anyone else feeling this way? Please PM me. I feel so done.

"I am a monster. A horrible wife and a terrible mother. All i do is shout and snap at people, my rage is out of control. If someone breathes in the wrong direction I can't help myself I completely lose it. I am so stressed out but I really can't figure out why. All I want is to run away and be left alone.
I've been like this before but being in the UK mental health services are absolutely dire so I was just told 'what do you have to be so depressed for? You have everything to live for!' and stuck on a waiting list for therapy which I waited 6 months for and it was totally pointless. This time I won't even bother turning to anyone for help. I can't stand being around my husband because he asks if I'm ok every 5 minutes when I just want to scream at him to leave me alone. I can't stand being around my kid because she does my head in and I have zero patience for her. It's neither of their fault, it's all me, I don't deserve them.

They say to cheer up or to stay distracted, that it will pass. It's easier to have a reason for being sad but when you don't even know why you're hurting- it's so unbearable.

"I don't know that it does much good, for me or anyone else, but I'm going to talk about my situation right now. I just turned 26 a few weeks ago, make decent money working for the military, get straight A's in my college classes, have a loving and supportive family, and am physically fit.
Despite all this, I'm one very sad, lonely bastard. But I didn't used to be...about 3 weeks ago, I was suddenly punched in the soul with a powerful depression that I can't seem to shake. 

Things I enjoyed doing before don't interest me at all. I spend most of my time sitting in bed reading about depression and listening to sad music. Interestingly, the cause of this depression seems to be lonliness. This is strange for me, because I've always been an introvert...I've always preferred to stay alone and would often make up excuses for why I couldn't go do stuff with friends. I've always been very happy and content knowing that I would live, and die, alone. Until now. Now I can't stand the idea of being alone. I want to go out and meet cute girls...but I can't...being introverted is so ingrained in me that I can't seem to go out and meet people. Oh, I've gotten out a couple times...I'll go to a bar, take a seat in the back, drink a couple beers alone then head home without a word to anyone. And then I beat myself up for failing at what I was supposed to do.

 I'll swipe right on a few hundred girls on tinder and get 1...maybe 2 matches. Which takes me into the second part of my issue. I have had an ongoing habitual porn habit since I was 13 years old. I've become so used to the beauty and figures of porn stars that I have a zero percent attraction to most average women. So here I am, a lonely person with standards that rule out all but the best of the fairer gender. How messed up is that? I think ""hey, what about that hefty girl over there, she looks lonely"" and immediately dismiss the idea because appearently I'd rather be miserable and borderline suicidal than settle for a big girl. Yay my brain...thanks bud. 

So anyway...that's about it. Crippling depression getting worse each day because I don't have a hot girlfriend. Does it make sense to you? Me neither...",5," the cause of this depression seems to be lonliness, I can't stand the idea of being alone, I can't seem to go out and meet people. "
"I'm terrified of going out and spending time with my old friends from high school. I just stay at home all day and wonder why I'm so lonely. There's always this feeling that I want or need something, that it's just out of reach, but I don't know what it is.

"Hey ya'll. 

I'm okay. 

I'm trying to be okay with being okay. 

I've been trying lots of things lately, and I'm certainly seeing the results of my bravery. I've sobered up. I just got a job that I'm super motivated about, and I think after a few weeks I'll really be able to rock the shit out of it. All in all, I've learned a lot about self-care and self-love in the past month. In the grand scheme, I feel like I might finally be out of the rabbit hole, and can finally get my life moving again. 

But at the same time, I feel alone. I finally accept myself again, which is the most important step. But I feel like no one else wants to share the riches if found within myself. 
I'm a pretty cool guy, I make pretty cool music, and I'm pretty damn funny. 
But I have no one to sing for, and no one to make laugh. And as much as I appreciate my own company, it would be nice to have someone who values me as much as I do. 

That might come off as egotistical, but hey I'm a human being and yeah I have an ego. 

Sometimes I still need someone to take care of me, and I feel like I'm coming up short. 
I could really use a companion right about now. Some one to let me know that it truly is worth it to try to be the best version of myself. 
Someone more than my mom and my mirror.

- The human condition is a curse.
- If I have nothing to look forward to in the present or the future and there is no afterlife, what am I supposed to work towards?
but the bottom line is that I feel sad and angry about how I am currently living my life and I have no intention of changing it because I don't want to or as I would rather put it to make myself feel better:
- Because I see no reason to.
- Because nothing will change for the better even if I try.
- other stupid excuses like the ones above.
