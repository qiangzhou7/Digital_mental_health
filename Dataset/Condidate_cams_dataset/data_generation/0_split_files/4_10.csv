Iâve recently broke up with a guy I was on and off with for years. He said some pretty hurtful things about me and threw all the stuff I said to him in confidence in my face...such as no wonder you were abused as a child etc...I havenât mov d out of bed properly for 2 days and I feel awful as I have a 7 year old girl (dad is no existent) I always get bad bouts of feeling down and I feel suicidal. Ive tried but obviously not hard enough as Iâm still here. I think my attempts have been really petty and I think Iâm scared to do it properly..I also donât want to leave my daughter behind on her own having to deal with that. I have recently met a lot of my family and a lot are half sisters and a half brother. I have a full sister who has no decided to move to Australia with a half brother she hardly knows at all...I know I envy her in some way as Iâve always wanted to move abroad. I just feel so helpless. I try and think I can do things but then that little voice creeps in saying that I am worthless and there is no point. My ex did not help. He was an alcoholic and he was not helpful when he got drunk. He would just cry ad start calling me names etc sometimes over nothing or sometimes over a trivial matter...my daughter only saw bits of that side of him as I mainly went round during the day and there was times when he was such a lovely guy. I just donât know what to do. I want to get away but every time I try something gets in my way. My daughter is great and sheâs so polite and has a great personality. I have been snapping at her lately and itâs not fair on her. I feel like just being me is destroying her and I just donât feel like I deserve to be in other peopleâs presence. I try and put a front on and be happy when I used to go out and I think people just get fed up because I probably say or do something stupid. Sorry for the big rant but I just need someone to talk to. ,4,"recently broke up with a guy I was on and off with for years, He said some pretty hurtful things about me and threw all the stuff I said to him in confidence in my face,such as no wonder you were abused as a child etc, havenât mov d out of bed properly for 2 days, feel awful "

He wrote, you don't eat right. Your idea of a meal is eating 5 crackers and chewing gum. You smoke cigarettes nonstop. You go out every weekend and drink a lot. You sometimes drink 12 diet mountain dews every day. You exercise way too much and are severely underweight for your height. You cry all the time and feel sorry for yourself.

"Last year I thought I finally got over my depression and anxiety, but then my girlfriend cheated on me, broke up with me, and told me I wasnât good enough for her. It all came back into my life, I did countless drugs which only made my depression worse, I had a comedown that lasted one week and I never spent more time thinking about suicide on a genuine level than ever. Iâve stopped the drugs, they were bad for me, but theyâve affected me long term now even more than I already had been affected by my depression and anxiety.

"I get this shit all the time. I'm not allowed to complain about my job because ""That's just how it is"". I tried opening up about recent depressive episode, I felt like I'd been kicked in the nuts because after weeks of work getting myself back on my feet my reward was my shitty ass job. The response I get from my family ""Suck it up, we've all been there"". 

I took a long hard fucking look at them, none of them are happy. They're just permanently angry. They're angry at people who have it better, yeah sometimes someone else gets lucky, but they're always just fucking resentful, never supportive. They think they're so much better, if they're better why are they angry? Why are they constantly complaining? If they're better than their managers, their bosses, their peers who got a promotion or the neighbours that have a stable family, why are they the ones with the loveless marriage, the ones that are passed up for promotions? 

They get fucking angry when I take time off for mental illness, ""If you're not in a mental hospital you're well enough to go to work"". Knowing them if I did go back to the psych ward they'd probably berate me for stealing money off of the NHS. I'd be open to them having issues that need to be worked out too, but I have no sympathy for them if they're gonna shit on other mentally ill folk instead of fixing themselves.

And if not? Fuck you. Just because you spend your time being angry, finding ways to put others down and digging yourself a bigger rut doesn't mean I have to. Yeah, I'm depressed, but so fucking what? I know I'm going to accomplish way more than they ever will. 

I spent the past week crying myself to sleep again. Need to go back to the Doctor and re-evaluate my meds, I don't know when I'll be able to go back to work full-time and I don't have any money for anything other than basic food and medication, but you know what? At least I'm not some self-righteous cunt who lives to ruin someone else's life. Fuck em. I'm gonna cry again tonight, most likely, but I'm not gonna blame it on someone else. I'm gonna fix my shit and at the very least not drag someone else down with me if I fail.

I'm so glad my Mom is one of the few genuinely caring people in this family. God knows I'd go insane without her support. It certainly makes up for everyone else.",4,"not allowed to complain about my job ,The response I get from my family ""Suck it up, we've all been there"

To be honest I donât blame them either, itâs a chore to maintain a relationship with me.  Iâm not normal, Iâm a disgusting human, Iâll let you down if you give me a chance.

"Hey everyone. Some context, I'm 16, sophomore, this all happened through my mid freshmen and mid sophomore year. I have pretty bad depression but got medication about maybe two months ago.

My once best friend lives over 7,000 miles away from me. She lives in South Africa while I live in the United States, specifically in central Texas. I met her on an app called ""talklife"" where you just vented about... life! I had made a post about how I hated myself, and I was in tears when one day she messaged me. She said she would be willing to be there for me and eventually our friendship really started to grow. She trusted me really quickly.

We mostly communicated on whatsapp. One day she randomly messaged me saying she hurt herself. It broke my heart. I wish I could have been there for her in person to hug her and be there for her. But I couldn't, but I did my best to comfort her. She opened up a lot on what she's been through. Bullying, parental abuse, and at one point a boy from her school pretty much threatened to rape her and nobody would take her seriously when she talked about it.

We both came to each other whenever we were hurt. I doubt she would ever admit it but she was a little clingy to me at one point, like she never stopped messaging me and sent me pictures and videos of herself randomly. She made me feel really important. But I soon became waaay more clingy than she ever was. I was very attached to her. Being the closest friend I have ever had and the first person I would go to when I was hurting. 

I think my clingyness to her, along with my insecurity and depression, made things start to go downhill in our friendship. The first time we had a fight was when I was having an awful day at school and I was dying to vent to her. I was holding in tears at my classes and needed to talk but she was busy and constantly going offline. I felt like she was ignoring me and I told her ""fuck you"" and blocked her. It was weird, I felt better after that. I shouldn't have, because I potentially just ruined a friendship, but I felt better just being nasty, like it got my frustration and hurt out.

I unblocked her and apologized but she was hurting. However I recorded a video of myself just talking and apologizing, and admitting how I was a dick, and she really felt way happier after seeing it and seemed back in a good mood. I was glad she wasn't holding a grudge and felt better after the video I sent her.

It may sound weird to send her a video of myself, but I think net neutrality is not a thing in South Africa, so she has some bundle she says where she can use a couple apps but is unable to call at all. It took me a while to understand.

We had a lot of arguments along our friendship. A lot of times I questioned if it was getting toxic. However whenever we explained both our sides and admitted our faults, we were on good terms again. However, I still think it was taking a toll on our friendship.

There was a point where we got into an argument about something, I don't remember exactly all the details, but here's what I remember.

So we had planned to want to visit sometime. One day I watched a documentary on South Africa over it's gangs and crimes, and I jokingly told her I changed my mind over visiting. It was a dick move to joke about but I told her I didn't mean it, and that she should calm down. She started going off on me and I kind of ignored it. She later posted something on her status with her parents hugging her and it's caption said ""abuse."" I know it seems like a joke, but she has told me about how her mom hits her and has made her cry in fear, and how she's felt suicidal because of how her mom treated her, so I wasn't sure. I told her if she needed anyone I was hear and she told me ""Uhm... it was a joke."" I know that doesn't seem rude to say, but by her standards it really is. I was pretty insulted and I started kind of going off on her.

Eventually I tried to apologize but she wouldn't respond. I called her a disease and she told me she wished me a good life but couldn't take this and blocked me, ""for good."" I messaged her through my brother, messaging her school's name. She had a uniform on her Instagram she gave me where it said her school's name in big bold letters, I didn't stalk her or anything. She unblocked me and kind of panicked, but I told her how I found her school's name. I texted her it because I learned freaking her out gets her to message people back. I said let's try to fix things but she wasn't budging. I started getting mad and feeling very hurt. I felt like if she was a real friend she would try to fix things with me, and not cut me off, especially considering how close we were. When I look back on this know, I was pretty stupid for how mean I was to her, and not realizing she was just tired of all the arguing and me hurting her.

I told her some incredibly nasty things, bringing up a lot of the things she struggled with and vented to me about, only to have me use it against her and break her down. I could tell I was getting to her, really making her hurt. I was acting like a sadist over her ""being a fake friend"" which she wasn't. Simply tired of the arguments, my temper and emotional bullying. She soon blocked me later.

I wish I realised that my reaction was so stupid. In my mind I just viewed her as being a fake friend, and never meaning any of the times she was there for me since she wouldn't want to fix things with me.

The feeling of her being a fake friend really hurt me and made me kind of crazy. I cried a lot because I felt so betrayed. I borrowed my friend's phone's to text her things like ""you should kill yourself"" and ""you just lost the only friend you had."" Just really nasty things. At one point, I made an entire account on Instagram dedicated to making fun of her. I posted dumb edits of her face and made posts going into detail why I thought she was a piece of shit. I followed a ton of her peers and got up to like 700 followers at one point. I informed her about it and she started freaking out.

A couple weeks pass. One day, a friend of her's, who was also mine too, saw one of my posts and sent it to her to maybe make her realise some of the scummy things she has been doing. I made them sound a lot worse than they really were yet not quite making it a lie. She said she wasn't going to read it and was starting to get over what I had done. My friend reminded her of the times I was there for her, and how if I was hurting this much she obviously meant a lot to me, and him saying that made her unblock me and forgive me. I was very skeptical but we talked things out and I deleted the account even though I still felt like she was being fake to me.

I needed to get somethings off my chest and in a voice note I told her how she had hurt me before the account was made, and I was still having trouble if I wanted to be her friend or not. She then told me that she was sorry for the hurt she caused, but then she told me the hurt she felt from what I did.

She said every day she walked into school terrified that someone would bring up the account. She would hurt herself and contemplated suicide constantly while the account was up and while I sent her those disgusting messages. She tried to force herself to be strong but all it did was push her suicidal urges down for a short time. She cried while saying all this and said she was scared to be my friend again, because she didn't want me to hurt her like that again.

It hurt so much. I started crying and really felt like shit. I explained more of the hurt I felt but also gave a deeper apology and explained more on things that had contributed to me being an asshole. She then recorded a very long voice note, I think about 9 minutes, talking about how she was sorry for making me cry and the hurt she caused before, and how she forgave me, and how she was my glad to be my friend again.

That feeling I had when we fixed all that shit was truly amazing. I felt so much better. But I also felt a lot of guilt for what I had done to her, but I was glad we were friends again. I tried to be kinder and more patient and understanding with her. But honestly it didn't work. We had another big argument shortly.

She told me she was planning on trashing her phone. I was really hurt. It was the only way I had to contact her, as she couldn't mail me since her mom couldn't stand online friends. I told her I was feeling like shit because of her doing this, but she said it was because she truly believed she would be happier without her phone, and she wasn't doing it to trash me. That's not how I felt and when I got those messages I had to lock myself in the bathroom and cry. I felt so unimportant to her.

We argued about it for a while but I kept trying to keep in my frustration and hurt. Then randomly one day I snapped. All those feelings of her being a fake friend came back. I told her I was so fucking done with her and if she ever messaged me again I would reactivate the account, and that she should go die in a hole.

A couple days later I apologized but asked her to still not contact me, and eventually after about two weeks I asked to talk to her. She said all the suicidal feelings came back and she went back to her habit of harming herself and crying to sleep. She kept saying things like ""go ahead, tell me I should die"" when I was apologizing and she eventually threatened to kill herself. I contacted her mom through one of her friends and told her to make sure she was okay. I know she was abusive but I know she wouldn't let her kill herself. She was okay, but she also told her all the things I did to her, which resulted in her mom telling me to kill myself and threatened me with a court case and tracking me down if she had to. Honestly wasn't worried about her threats at all, and even if I did get in trouble, well I deserved it.

So yeah, I am sorry this was so damn long. I just wanted this entire situation off my chest. I feel so guilty for how I hurt her and constantly cry at night because of it, and I miss her so much. I wish I wasn't such an asshole. I have never treated anybody so poorly in my life yet she's the closest friend I have ever had. I'm usually extra nice to girls and I was always there for her when she was hurting or needed anyone but sometimes my emotions would go crazy and my mind would get truly fucked up. A lot of it has to do with us being only online friends. I really don't treat any of my friends in real life like that.

I really wish she would listen to me apologize and kind of explain why I was hurt, and allow me to make it up to her by maybe like mailing her a gift. I miss her. I genuinely hope she's okay. I don't want to believe I'm an awful person because I do care about her, and so many other people in my life, but sometimes I'm just a terrible person with the way I explode. I don't know if I should forgive myself, I feel like I deserve to hate myself and have everyone around me hate me.

*TL;DR I emotionally tormented my best friend because I was so insecure and vengeful for times she really hurt me, even though it usually wasn't her fault, and it resulted in so much harm towards her. I feel like I deserve so much worse because of what I did.*

I'm sorry if this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to post this, but it does deal with two people who suffer from it and causes a lot of pain in their life even though the mail focus has been on the relationship. This subreddit also seems the most supportive from others I have tried.",4,not realizing she was just tired of all the arguing and me hurting her.

"Hey guys. This might sound funny to you (it sounds funny even to me lol), but i'm really ashamed of my past.

I'm 17 year old, and about 5 months ago I shaved my head. Previously, I had mid-sized hair and I was a cute guy, but when I cut my hair I looked really, really bad. Some people even couldn't recognise me. But that's not everything - one day I got drunk with my friend and we shaved the ends of our eyebrows (yeah, we really did it), so I looked like a serial killer or a pedophile... I literally wanted to cut my whole head next morning.

Few days later, I was at brother's birthday party and I took some photos with him and his friends, and one of the guys posted the photo of us on facebook. He didn't tag me, but he tagged my friend, who is in my class. He even put a cover photo with me and some other guys... 

Now, here comes the real problem...

A few weeks ago, I met a girl through one of my classmates (not the one I mentioned before), and now we're in relationship. Now, I'm scared that he could maybe tell her about my hair-shaving, or that my girlfriend could find my bald photos (4 of them) on facebook.

Yes, I know this is a really funny and strange story, but I don't know how to deal with this... I'm thinking about this whole day. That simply kills me, because she'll probably find them one day (and maybe even break up with me), and I don't know how should i react...

"Have any of you lost a pet that you raised and were solely responsible for? My depression has gotten really bad again in the past 2 years and I've spent alot of that time in my room or depressed outside in a zoned out state of mind. One of my best buddies which was my Lovebird absolutely loved being around me. They are silly little birds and do really odd things and love to snuggle with you.

But with my depression I used alot of that time being by myself without my bird. Of course like most things you don't realize how incredibly important they are to you till it's too late. When I woke up to find Kiwi dead in her food bowl I was just devastated. It really didn't hit me bad till a few days later when I realized how she could of helped me during my depression and how my depression caused her to live a lonelier life as well. I knew it was my fault 100% why she died and looked into alot of things that I thought were safe for birds that did harm to her. 

I even did a proper funeral box for her, wrapped her in an orange towel, flowers, golden sacred art with quartz crystals and buried her in my backyard. 
It even got the people in the parrot sub to shed some tears. 

Time hasn't helped and I truly feel like a part of me, one of the few remaining pieces of happiness has been torn away from me. No matter what she always wanted to hang out with me and we've been through alot the 10 years I had her. I still remember coming back from the hospital after my suicide attempt where I was gone for a few weeks and when I came home she freaked out when she saw it was me, chirping and flying around the cage like she couldn't believe I was back. I used to meditate with her outside, play all types of games and now its all over.

Sometimes you get that one pet where it's just a really incredible bond and it sucks when something shitty like depression ruins the time I'll never get back with her along with the stress or loneliness I caused her.

If any of you have pets you love, really try to be with them more often to see if they will at least rid your mind of depression or at least have the comfort in knowing that your making them happen. It may not solve your problems but this whole situation has shown me how delicate life is. 

I don't know exactly the reason for this post, I just wanted to get my feelings out there in case any of you are animal lovers, try not to let depression destroy that friendship/bond where a pet can sometimes love you no matter what.",4,Have any of you lost a pet that you raised and were solely responsible for

"I've been suffering with anxiety and depression for a while now but it has increasingly gotten worse within the last year and I feel like there is no getting better.

I have not seeked medical advice as I dont know where to start and what to say. I dont know what made me this way and I just wish it was as simple as popping to the shops and buying some pills to make it all better. There is more important things in the world than me and I dont want to waste anyones time.

I used to cope by keeping myself busy and pushing myself to do anything and everything to avoid having to sit with just my own thoughts for company. But its beating me and the motivation to do anything is becoming none existent, it's like I want to but I cant push through the voices in my head and the pressure on my chest.

My friends seem to be becoming more and more distant with little understanding on whats going on with me but too wrapped up in their own lifes.

A hand full of my work collegues seem to be going through a similar thing but can come off quite judgemental and I honestly think if I confided in them they would just think I was after attention and 'jumping on the bandwagon'. And the other hand full slag off depression as if it doesnt exist or they are worse off as if its a competition.

My family have their own issues and I feel as much as they would love to help they need to focus on themselves and each other.

My boyfriend is the one person I thought I could rely on to speak to and make me feel at comfort if not better when im at my worst but nearly a month ago he nearly broke up with me. I fear its gotten too much for him. He has since said he didnt mean it and you dont realise what you've got until its nearly gone but its broken me. The one person I thought I could be myself with and express my true feelings and now its just another face to put on.

"Before I start, I just wanna say that I am in no danger of harming myself, I'm simply just going through a rough patch in life. 

I'm in the middle of winter break of my senior year of college and have never felt more lonely. Despite having a strong friend group at college and being in an amazing relationship with someone I love very much, I feel totally isolated. Many of my friends from college and my girlfriend live in the same town, while I live 3 states and 10 hours away from them. At home, I have found that, since starting college, all of my friends from high school have practically abandoned me. Despite seeing them frequently hanging out over the past 4 years on social media, I have yet to receive a response to any of the texts I've sent out, and, as a result, I find myself at home with no social life, thus causing a strong re-emergence of my depression that has pretty much taken over my thoughts. I live in a pretty rural area, so there aren't many ways to meet new people over break due to how spread out everything is and the extremely cold weather. While I've been able to spend some time with my family, my parents have to work most days. 

While my friends and girlfriend have been hanging out frequently, I've been delegated to sitting at home alone browsing through netflix. To make matters more difficult for me, I've been pretty open with my girlfriend about my situation but have found that she has been rather unresponsive due to a very active social life and busy family schedule at home. Its important to also understand that she has serious depression as well and recently moved to the town she's currently in 2 years ago and had some trouble meeting people as well, something with she has obviously overcome.  There have been one or two days where we've been able to text back and forth for a few hours, where I've been able to share my feelings with her about my break and have received helpful advice and comforting words in response; however a majority of our days have been delegated to a ""good morning"" text, one or two 5 minute check-ins throughout the day and a ""good night"". For example, on New Years Eve I was stuck at home alone (parents go to bed early) and asked my girlfriend earlier in the day if she'd like to talk for 5 minutes at midnight. Upon the drop of the ball, I simply receive a ""Happy New Years, I love you"" text, which I reply to asking if she wants to talk and then receive no response for the rest of the night until I said I'm going to bed to which she immediately responds good night. Due to my loneliness, I've tried to arrange some skype sessions or phone calls with her, because it'd be nice to have someone to actually talk to thats not my family, but have had little success. I find that some days I'll ask her if she'd like to have a phone call to which i recieve a ""maybe"" response, only to later find out that she made plans after our conversation to do something with her friends. I've been having trouble finding a way to communicate to her that it would be nice if I were to be able to skype of talk with her at least a few times over break while also trying to give her space to enjoy her time at home. I understand that she's been really busy, it just feels like she's made no efforts to try and talk with me. 

This situation has left me extremely conflicted about my life and my relationships. I know I tend to overthink things a lot when my depression re-emerges but I also find it frustrating that the person with whom I am closest doesn't seem to have a desire to talk to me. I'm hesitant to text some of my friends individually because I've never really had serious depression problems while I've known them and don't know how they'd handle it. I don't know how to cope with this situation I'm in. With graduation and adult life looming for me as well, I find myself anxious, lonely, depressed, and overthinking my entire life. The only friends I have I've made while in college and I will soon moving on from that stage of my life. I know that I'll still be friends with them in the future, but will likely be spread out across the country. I'm nervous that I will continue to have social troubles outside of college in the real world and find myself constantly googling how to make new friends in new places. Loneliness is one of my biggest fears in life and even facing it short term has unleashed a world of problems within me. 

I hope that this ""rant"" isn't too scatterbrained or jumbled, I just wanted to get it off my chest. I'm not sure if any of you have gone through similar situations but I figured I might as well reach out somewhere.

"I always feared people's judgement.  I never wanted to be known as the weird one or the outsider.  I always kept to myself.  No one really bothered me, but no one really cared for me either.  I was in the middle, not bad enough to be hated, not good enough to be loved.  I was content with this position for a while, but it was lonely.  I would always sit at home, while others would go out and actually do things with friends.  I would lament my existence, and question if I was ever good enough.  The truth is I am afraid to just be who I am around people.

I have seen how people treat others who are different.  They can be mean and cruel.  Their avoidance can hurt and damage, and their ridicule can cut and bruise.  I have been on the receiving end of cruelty, and I would rather not go in depth about it.  People don't accept me now, even as docile and non-aggressive as I am, so how would they accept me if I was myself?  I worry they would think I am weird and annoying, even though I don't mean to be at all.

It has made me lose my curiosity for life and all the things within it, understanding how something works, and I hate myself for it, as this have been one of the biggest drives for me in all my life. I could get excited just about a small idea popping in my head. Today no ideas are floating, my brain is empty, meds, depression or just myself?

"I finally got the time to post this, I've been opening the submit page for a while but I couldn't just do it. I need to get this off my chest.

It's been a real hell for me since 2 years when my mother died and I am forced to live and get tortured by my stepfather but since December, I feel like I've been going through much worse things now. 

I'm already suffering enough from horrible family abuse, death of my mother, finding out the hard and sad truth who were my real parents, social anxiety and losing nearly all of my friends, but I've been now also suffering quite alot at college.

I'm getting nearly constantly bullied by my groupmates since the first week of college. I've been called names, humiliated infront of others, including teachers, even physically hit couple of times. I've tried to ignore them and report them to our teacher, but that did do nothing, only if anything, my teacher also made fun of me and believed their rumour about me infront of the group. Other groupmates won't do anything about it either because they all know each other. Some of the bullies are even bullying me together so I can't do so much about it, they also keep bullying teachers too and have the worst grades ever.

I almost literally have no friends in college, except few guys and they betrayed me too. It's so hard for me to have great grades when you're basically alone all the time without any help at all.

In the last day when we were on practice, they refused to work with me and they shamed me the whole day, I didn't get to do anything at practice at all because of them, that made me so hopeless in myself and I don't feel motivated to improve practing after this at all. 

It's really hard for me to live with my stepfather who often emotineally abuses me alot and tried to kick me out of home once, with a family that tried to commit me into mental hospital in a sick way, without friends and being constantly bullied in college. I feel like giving up anytime soon and accept my fate if nothing changes.

The only game that makes me feel better for awhile is Life is Strange. It has alot of situations which hit me home and I would relate to them so hard, making me feel better feeling that I'm not alone. Also the game mainly is about friendship, Max, Chloe and Rachel are really great friends and I've had these kind of friends before I lost them unfortunately. Actually felt I wasn't alone while playing this masterpiece game.

I wish one day I wouldn't wake up to stop suffering like this forever everyday.
