"Hello all. This is my first post in this sub, and this actually is probably my first serious post on all of Reddit. Iâm just here because I would like to get some things off my chest and Iâm not in a situation where I can express my feelings to people around me in my life such as my mom and dad or friends. Itâs best to say these things to people I donât know but may also suffer from the same feelings or ideas.

I am severely and unhealthily depressed. I stress myself out over little things, I constantly put myself down, blame myself for things that I damn well know are not actually my fault, treat myself horribly and find different ways to make my life even worse daily. I donât like being this way, but I have tried so many different methods to change these kinds of behaviors and feelings but nothing I have done makes me change. Iâve tried antidepressants, ânatural alternativesâ to medicine, exercising my stress away, surrounding myself with positive thoughts and energy and people, but for some reason, every night when I return home and get in the bed, I lie awake thinking of how worthless and pointless my existence is. I am absolutely SHOWERED by thoughts of depression and worthlessness, despite knowing how many good friends and family I have, despite knowing how good my life has the potential to be. Every day feels almost like a struggle to me because I spend a good portion of the day out and about with friends or at work, or whatever Iâm doing, but as soon as I get by myself somewhere, I almost immediately start to get those depressive thoughts again and again.

It almost seems like my brain refuses to let the rest of me be happy. I try to push away the bad thoughts and sadness but it just keeps coming back even stronger every time and I have gotten to the point where I donât know how to handle myself anymore. I have suicidal thoughts daily, although I would never act upon them because I know that suicide is not the only answer to my issues. But itâs just an every day thought that I have, that I struggle with constantly. Always telling myself, âYouâre a failure anyway, why not just do itâ or things like âYou know your family or anybody wouldnât ACTUALLY miss you, right?â Itâs just little things like those that add up ever so much throughout the days, weeks, and months that I struggle with. Sometimes I will have days that are absolutely fantastic like going to a concert or being in a show or whatever, and then as soon as I get home, I feel like garbage for whatever reason. No matter how many positive thoughts I try to think, the bad thoughts always find a way to become stronger and break through my positivity. And Iâm just not sure what to do about it anymore.

Apologies for writing so much, but as I said before, these were things that I was keeping bottled up because I could not tell my family or friends about this because of reasons Iâm not actually sure of. Fear that I will be judged, maybe fear of losing friendships, I donât know. Regardless, I thank you for reading this long ass post and hope that maybe someone has any stories or advice or whatever they would like to share.",4,would like to get some things off my chest and Iâm not in a situation where I can express my feelings to people around me in my life such as my mom and dad or friends
"I watched The Greatest Showman the other day, and the song âA Million Dreamsâ made me cry so hard. It basically details the love story between the main character and his future wife. They talk about the big dreams they have, and the fact that they picture a world where these dreams come true helps them get through today.

I just kept wishing that I had someone who loved me the way they loved each other. That I could have dreams that could actually become a reality someday. That I could be someone special instead of another sad lonely person waiting for a miracle that will never happen.

I guess sometimes dreams are only meant to be dreams.",4, just kept wishing that I had someone who loved me the way they loved each other
"In the past two weeks, I haven't spoken to a soul. When I was a kid, people always said that I was chatty. It took me a long time to realize that I spoke all my thoughts trying to get the inability to have a conversation out of my system. It's years later and sometimes I think it's better to be alone. It takes so much for me to hold my self together. So much to not end my life. I hope someday I'll be glued back, or someone will help me carry the pieces. In reality, however, I'm constantly scared that if I let someone come close, they'll break me even more. It's like standing in front of a cracked mirror. The reality is distorted. Self image delusional. A few more cracks and it would all come falling down.",4,"In the past two weeks, I haven't spoken to a soul, inability to have a conversation out of my system"

I've just been feeling worse since then. I tried to be optimistic about it, and to have my new year's resolution be some bullshit like ""talk to more people"" but I know that's not going to happen. I'm so socially awkward I can't start a conversation, and nobody wants to talk to me.

I've also thought of talking to a therapist about it, but that will never happen. I can't see myself ever opening up about any of this in person.

I just wish I could be able to literally just fucking talk to other people without being awkward, let alone have a single friend. ",4,"realized that outside of family, I had no contacts to add, None, have a single friend outside of my family"

Today I will be sharing one of them:thinking way too far,WAAY TOO FAR...

It usually starts by me thinking about the good things that will be happening to me in the near future,like,eating out with my family,but the problem is...I always think,""what's after that?""
It goes like this

my stupid ass asking:well,what's after that dinner?
brain that i desperetely want to amputate:well,you will go to sleep,and experience the misery of worrying about the future,as always

my stupid ass asking:well,what happens when i finally get my shit together?

brain that i desperetely want to amputate:well,you will experience the misery and stress of going to a good middle school and the overwhelming amount of homework.
my stupid ass asking:well,what if I graduate with a degree after the misery?

brain that i desperetely want to amputate:You may get a well paying job,but your parents are still going to die anyway,have fun.
my stupid ass asking:well,after getting a well paying job,what if i manage to achieve my life goals?
brain that i desperetely want to amputate:your parents are still dead anyway,and you still have to go through the misery of reflecting on all the memories with her and crying your ass off,and after achieving your goal,you will have nothing to do,and just sit there and die,i guess.

This is where my brain goes to sleep,and I reflect of my thoughts,and think further,as I am a dumbass.

me:Well,what if I die?

me to me:you will either be rencarniated,or experience infinate blackness,wait,you are dead!oh yeah,since you do not have a sence of perspective anymore,time will theretically go infinatily fast and the universe will just die of heat death,and even if you rencarniate,there is a 99.9969% that you will become something of no value,like a gnat,or a housefly,and even if you become human again,you will have another chance to experience the misery of feeling dead,depression,and 20+ years of education,and also die on the inside seeing our society collapse right before your eyes,and also,the memories of your awesome parents will also be gone,or you will spawn in a test tube,and you will be a subject for science experiments.

"Hey guys,
I've been depressed, anxious and introverted my whole life but I've kinda learnt to live with it. Recently since I don't sleep much and I have a lot of down time to myself I consume myself in my thoughts. Yesterday my girlfriend dumped me, it was genuinely sick, we had been dating almost 7 months and when she dumped me she laughed and smiled and treated me like shit. It was also my birthday. I loved this girl, I put in so much effort to be a person suited to society and not an overly cynical, disfunctional boyfriend in order for her to like me and so I could find happiness. I'm sitting here now writing this because I have no one, I feel physically sick with the way she is treating me and how once again she has abandoned me. She is fucking with me, ontop of all the bad shit that has recently happened to me. I can't function now, I feel so helpless, I don't know what to say or do, I constantly feel overwhelmed with anxiety. I haven't been this depressed in years. This is such a dark place and I have no one. I just want to end it. 

Please anyone give me some advice. ",4," she dumped me she laughed and smiled and treated me like shit, feel physicaaly sick the way she treating me,  She has abondened me"
"Hello. I am 22 years old. Me and my family are suffering from a severe depression over things that has happened in 2016. Starting from october 2016, I've started writing a public diary in Tumblr, hoping that this can actually help relieve this opressive feeling. Has any of you tried doing something like this and if so, is it helping you?",4, me and my family suffering from a severe depresion 
"My daughter tried to kill herself, again. This is the third attempt that I know of. Her husband walked into the bathroom as she was digging into her arm. He said he has never seen anything like it. He is traumatized. After discovering that she had been self medicating with drugs and then this he is done. He is scared that her poor choices will land him in military prison. I love my daughter and this young man and I am saddened for both of them. I am sad for my daughter, I am not sure she will survive this break up. I am truly afraid that I will be burying my daughter.

My daughter has a mental illness. She has been diagnosed as bipolar and clinically depressed. This has been a struggle since she was a young teenager. We have lost friendships and family ties because of her poor choices, the lies, and lack of impulse control. She has stolen medication from me and others. She revealed, in a most spectacular fashion, that she was a drug addict when she was a teenager, all in front of a class that we were taking together. Needless to say I gave myself permission to have distance from my daughter. She was an adult. I had gotten her help, I had fought with her about staying on medications and going to doctors appointments. As an adult I could no longer force her to do what needed to be done, it was now up to her. 

She seemed to figure it out. She had a job, a bf, a home, and friends. I could see that she struggled with the rollercoaster that came with her diagnosis, but she was making it. Couple years in things toppled. Suddenly her friends and bf were done with, she had burned bridges with them. She was floating with no anchor or refuge. Except me and my partner. We were moving and offered her the opportunity to start fresh in another state. She leaped at the opportunity. But she first wanted to visit with my sister in yet another state. The agreement was that she would join us in the new place after spending time with my sister.

This turned into her living there until she burned bridges there. She became homeless. Too prideful to tell me that she was reduced to living in a homeless camp. All because she was now taking drugs to self medicate and she knew this would horrify me. She kept a job. She met the young man who would help get her clean, and marry her. He joined the military, they got stationed state side. Her husband and I continually prompted her to get medication and help. She put it off. She was on a high with life. Then the cycle began again.

She started using meth about 6 months ago. She snorted cocaine. She smoked weed. She planted this stuff in another persons car so that they couldn't turn her in. She was making illogical choices based on the drugs and her ill mind. My SIL left her to figure out what to do. Her actions could land him in Leavenworth, ruin his career. 

He came home and found what she had done. He got help for her. She calls me to tell me in her most piteous voice. Tries to tell me that he wouldn't listen to her, that she was getting rid of his monster of a wife. No amount of explaining and questioning would get her to see that these were her choices. As I write this, she is hospitalized. She knows that he wants a divorce, but she wants to fight for him. No convincing her that this is what needs to happen right now. He doesn't trust her, he is angry, and tired. I don't think he wants to continue and I can not blame him.

So where does this leave my broken daughter? I don't know. I am in another state. I am not where she wants to be. I fear that once she is released and she sees that he is done and he removes her from base it will be the beginning of the end. I have told her she needs to figure out what she wants. I feel she will choose drugs and all that comes with it. While I want so much more for her, I can't make her choose the path of health and sanity. I am heartbroken.",4," daughter has mental illness, tried to kill herself, diagnosed with bipolar disoreder , lost family ties and friendship"
"I have no reason to feel this way. I am surrounded by loving family and caring friends but is there a reason for me just listening to slow music that appeals to me personally most nights and just feeling sad?

 I haven't really felt 100% for a couple years now, but no one i know has an inkling of what's happening to me, cause i think i hide it quite well with humour and when im socialising, it grants me temporary relief from these feelings of self doubt and loneliness, but always, when im alone these feelings creep back in and i can never seem to be rid of them. 

I've never really had much luck with relationships, i had something serious a couple months back, which actually stopped my lamenting, but it fizzled out pretty quickly and the feelings returned, and magnified with each failure to communicate with any girl im interested in.

And now i sit here by myself, again, watching the fireworks from my window as my family sleeps and with music in my ears, just feeling.. sad.

I don't really know how to explain it or why I'm like this, so i figured i may as well share and get outside opinions on it. Im not searching for a solution, just a means to understand this

"I'm 18(M) and turning 19 in a month time. I've been having depression since late Jan 2016 which started because of an extremely bad break up, financial issues, parents divorcing thus having to move out as well as performing badly in class.


i'll try to keep the post short and simple because I'm exhausted right now, typing this on mobile doesn't help too, especially for formatting.


Any advice from those who have/had depression would be greatly appreciated. Well, just ranting for online does relief everything in which I had bottled up.


So on new year, I just broke up with my girlfriend(4months) and connections from my close friends. My relationship was toxic as it felt as though I was the only one trying as I clinged onto the thoughts that she would be the one who help me to get out of depression. She was initially really supportive and that was why I was attracted to her, she helped me to elavate my abuse of tobacco but I feel as though I'll fall back into that sinkhole.


People change and I don't blame her. She feels exhausted and does not feel the same way anymore.


Right now I'm just really exhausted of everything.
I have scheduled appointments for a psychiatrist that was done by the SAF, Singapore's Army basically.


I don't know what to expect besides perhaps being announced as clinically depressed. Does a psychiatrist really help? Any response would be greatly appreciated.

"It's six hours until New Year here and I just want to curl up and die.

I've had depression for as long as I can remember but it recently has become worse. My boyfriend of 2 and a half years (who I live and work with) broke up with two weeks ago. Tonight he has gone to one of our colleagues house parties, I wasn't invited. No one invited me anywhere and I don't blame them.

I'm not angry that he went, I am angry at myself. I have no friends, live miles away from any family and at the age of almost 28 have nothing to live for. I try to stay upbeat but I really don't see the point. I've alienated myself from everyone and this is what I get. I just want it all to be over.",4,"Broke up with boyfriend,have no friends, I've alienated myself from everyone "
"*I apologize in advance for the throwaway and being vague, I feel like this post would do more harm than help if anyone involved were to find it*

**A little backstory:**
My (22m) ex (19f) has a history of depression, much of it deep seeded from experiences in her childhood and a lack of support from her family. For the better half of our relationship (~1.5 year)  it seemed to be fairly under control and she seemed pretty happy. She had meds and was seeing a therapist. I've also struggled with depression for about 3 years now, starting before our relationship. I broke up with her for fairly shallow reasons; I was freaked out about being ""tied down"" having to always consider someone else's emotions and feelings when I can barely take care of my own, and I have huge self-esteem issues. It was obviously very rough but we still care about each other and try to maintain a friendship still.

**What is very concerning to me:** she recently got a new boyfriend and everyone appears to be ok that we still talk as friends to support each other, mainly because we know each other well so it's easy for us to talk openly about personal issues. Very recently however, she messaged me around 1:30 AM and said she needed help, which I've learned is code for she's drunk at a friends and can't stay the night there. Ask her if she called her boyfriend and she says they haven't been talking. Says she can't go home because her parents will flip their shit (which is true). I offer to give her a ride and let her stay at my place and she agrees. 

I knew she had been drinking occasionally with friends but this was completely different. She was almost incoherent and told me during the ride that this was the 5th night in a row that she had drank. While we were dating we rarely drank and if we did it was together, so this was completely irregular behavior. I remember she trailed off one of her sentences by repeating ""I don't know"" over and over while crying. We get to my house (I still live at home) and she's stumbling around and wakes my mom up who I apologize to profusely. We go to my room and she starts crying again and saying some very dark stuff, basically about not wanting to live anymore. I'm very shaken at this point, no longer annoyed and I start crying with her while we just lay on my bed. I had no idea what to say or do so I just kind of held her from behind while she calmed down so she couldn't hit herself or make a lot of noise and wake my parents. When she sobered up a little bit she apologized and said that she ""just didn't care about anything anymore and wanted to disappear"". We fell asleep around 6 AM.

**If you read nothing else, please read this:** We wake up in the afternoon and I take her to her car. Both of us are pretty silent, she was hungover, upset and embarrassed so I try not to say anything insensitive. We part ways and I just go for a long ass drive to clear my head. I have no fucking idea how to deal with this, I can't even take care of myself. I get drunk alone a lot and just don't tell anyone. I lay in bed all fucking day wanting to cry. I don't leave my house unless I have to. But I still care about her and need to help her because who the fuck else will? Her boyfriend is apparently useless, her ""friends"" are terrible fucking influences who don't care about anything besides getting fucked up to hide from their problems and her parents the moodiest people I've ever met. This whole situation has completely thrown me into a hole again because I have no idea what to do for her or myself. I'm not a dad, a therapist or a psychiatrist. I NEED advice to help her before she hurts herself or becomes dependent.

**TL;DR** please read the last paragraph if nothing else, my ex (who I'm still close to) and I both have depression. She has been turning to alcohol to escape her feelings and I am not a dad or therapist and have no idea how to help her before she hurts herself or gets worse *without* seeming like a hypocrite because I do the same damn shit.",4,"My ex, still care about her ,still  care about her,thrown me into the hole again"
"It seems like my 15-mid 20's I've had depression, I'm 25.

And these last few months hit me hard: I love to learn, I love learning about the world, the universe, programming in C++, etc. But reading philosophy made matters worse, I couldn't even get into discussions like free will or determinism, or simple politics; even worse if nihilism, existentialism, the existence of God, the soul, quantum mechanics, etc. were involved.

I noticed I had problem. I kinda just realized that nobody knows what's going on. Those questions, the big whys and hows are somehow preventing me from carrying on with my life. I was upset because it feels like there were no answers to those things. I still can't think straight, I get very emotional sometimes, crying in secret (I know, I should tell others). I think it has to do with my childhood: My mother is a hoarder, my father is an alcoholic who sometimes beat her, and they sometimes threatened to harm each other with knives and guns, my father went on long trips away, sometimes the police were involved. My mother would beat me and my brother, with belts or brooms (or la fabulosa chancla), sometimes for doing bad things... that's how they (and us, by proxy) were raised. But my sister and younger brother, haven't been hit once after I was 15. I know they wanted better for me and my siblings, deep down. And I don't want my siblings to feel any similar things, but they still live with my mother in a house full of junk. I want to help my parents, they're divorced now, but I want to help them. Has anyone gone through something similar? Is there anyway to help?

So anyways, back to this 2017. I'm gonna start meditation, connect with my family and long-time girlfriend, focus on studying, maybe start a local rock band with friends. How about you guys? What are you guys planning?

Happy New Years.",4,"mother is a hoarder, father is an alcoholic who sometimes beat her, threatned to harm each other with knives, mother would beat me and my brothers with  belts or brooms, dont want siblings to  feel any similar things"
"*wave*

I'm unsure where to even begin..

It's almost 2017. I'm 22 years old. I wake up every morning and regret the first and last breath of every moment from then until sleep carries me away, back into a dream world where my problems don't exist..

I'm struggling with things.. My memories just feel like I'm looking at a glimpse of somebody elses past.. I can't even focus on time accurately anymore. Everything seems to blend into one at times to the point that it's hard to recall whether things happened one day or another.. 

I have no purpose, no meaning in life, outside of living for my family. That's the one saving grace, I'd be long gone if they weren't around. But.. the longer this goes on the more I question the futility of living this way.. Selfish springs to mind, I would rip through their lives and leave an unfillable hole if I ever managed to muster the courage and end it all.

On top of this mental nightmare, I have no friends, I hate my job, my boss is a textbook asshole, using his position to self promote his importance and bring everyone else down even further. I've managed to be trapped in a life where work is the only social activity I partake in.. I play video games occasionally, but always alone. Socially, I'm inert. I can't help but feel if I had more friends and some semblance of a social life, my problems would be alleviated slightly.. but I've tried to no avail. I struggle with making friends, more-so any good ones. I can only reminisce of the times before I pushed them all away it would seem.

I feel the longer I stay here the further I drift ever closer to the end.. Looking for a job to no avail, the added failure stacking more onto an already miserable existence.

Don't get me wrong, suicide clearly isn't the ideal situation. Even I understand that there are bound to be things in life I enjoy, love even, that I've never even experienced.. but one person can only take so much before they snap. Even if it's in the pursuit of happiness.

People outside of this debilitating illness don't understand. I'm not sure many of them ever will. If I was asked ""Do you want to die?"" It's an easy no. Well why then? Because I'm tired of the crying, I'm tired of spending days in bed forcing myself to eat to avoid ending up back in the hospital.. There are no words that accurately definitively say what I feel, none that would provide the insight so many need to understand this shit. I'm at a point sometimes where I want to end it just to illustrate how I actually feel.. So people will finally understand.. Actions speak louder than words after all.

Time will tell where I end up. As I write this, seeing my life outlined like this, I can't work out if I feel validated or like I've just sunk even further into the abyss..

I didn't anticipate writing so much, it wrote itself mostly..

Sorry if it bore any of you, I needed to speak and this is one of the few subreddits where I didn't think I would be judged.

"Basically, I'm a girl who turned 18 in november. I've struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember (I started self harming when I was 12, but I managed to stop when I was around 15 or 16) and this year it's only gotten worse. My friends don't want to be around me anymore because they say I'm too miserable, or I'm ""always in a bad mood"". I suspect myself of having depression and I find it incredibly hard to get excited or happy about anything at all - I seem to have two modes of indifference or unhappiness. Recently (especially in the holiday season) my thoughts are consumed with how much I want to die, how much easier it would be and how little a lot of people would care. That, or many of my ""friends"" whom I thought the world of but I've since come to realise are only friends with me through circumstance, would suddenly care when they are nowhere to be found right now. At this point I have stopped trying to open up to my friends. I took a couple weeks off school last month in order to get my head straight and when asked why I hadn't been in, it very quickly became a competition of ""who has it worst"". I do have one friend who means the absolute world to me and I feel like I could tell him anything, but there's only so much you can burden one person with.
I've thought many times about how I could kill myself and I have written notes out for my closest friend and a few other people - at this point, it's just finding the courage to do it.",4,"My friends dont want to be around me anymore, I am too miserable, stopped trying to open up to my friends"
"This year has been complete hell for me I turned 22

I lost my girlfriend of 4 years she broke up with me by handing me the custom necklace I got her..

I fell thousands of dollars in debt from helping her with everything she needed from phones to car payments.

I met my best friend fell completely in love with her thought she felt the same way so I asked her out she turned me down. everything was fine (I just loved her company) until 2 weeks ago she started dating and I never really see her anymore and is now about to move away.... 

I'm stuck living with my parents who tell me how everything I do is wrong how I should have a 50k+ income how I should have moved out 2 years ago becomes it's easy to afford to live. I can't afford to move out alone I truly thought she loved me and we were simply going to get a apartment we even talked about it a lot to the point we looked at some..

I'm ending 2016 thousands in debt alone and depressed knowing there will never be anyone there for me when I need them my few friends I consider family and I would do anything for them (from buying tires to food to giving them a ride) and I like to think that they would be there for me... but this year has shown me that's not the case that non of them truly care about me...

I've been sleeping all day after work crying slowly realizing I have no one even as I write this I'm realizing that.

"I know we've all been through a lot this year. Some have experienced loss and others have been on the edge of their lives. 

I'm not going to be one of those people that gets super excited because its a new year because although its a new year tomorrow is still only Sunday. I've been reflecting all day unfortunately about the past year. The first half was pretty decent. I still had a wife and wasn't alone. Then the second half I lost it all. My wife, my car, my house and my family. I hate this so much. I've also lost a lot of friends that apparently can't handle someone who has depression which in my opinion is a stupid reason to not be someone's friend anymore.

My life's stock dropped a ton of points this year and I haven't been this depressed since my mom died 20 some years ago and I was abused. I miss the friends I had, but at the same time I guess they never really were my friend to begin with. 

Sadly, I feel like here at r/depression is the only place anymore where I can freely say how I feel without anyone else judging me. Without anyone else running away from me. If I posted this on social media people would just think I'm ""begging for attention"" when in reality this is simply how I feel. I hate knowing that I am always one to listen to what others are going though and able to sympathize, but that never seems to be a two-way street. It's as if I have some sort of disease and they stay away from me when I need them the most.

I also hate it when people say ""do it yourself"" ""build yourself up"" or my personal favorite ""you don't need anyone"" its so simple to say when you are the one that isn't depressed. I also hate it because I am a guy and other guys say ""you need to man up and stop being a bitch about this"" 

I wish I had an actual friend outside of here. I've resorted to Tinder and other ""dating"" apps but I suppose I'm not attractive enough either.

"Kinda a long post. And I'm sorry. 

I've spent majority of my life following in other people's footsteps or following a path someone else created for me. I've never really been given the chance to create my own footsteps.. until now. 

For the last year and a half I've been with a guy let's call Christian. He was great. Honestly. We never fought. We never really got mad. We always talked things through. We always made sure that we understood each other.  And he understood me. He knew me so well. He knew when I was having an anxiety attack and he knew what to say to coax me out of it. He knew how to handle my depression. And honestly I could say that for the first time in my life I was happy. REALLY HAPPY. It honestly seemed too good to be true. And i guess looking back it was.

In Sept he left to school. It's an odd school where he's on a boat and only has service at ports.  So I could only really talk to him every couple of weeks and only if he found wifi. Well most of his ports are small towns in countries that it's harder to find wifi. You can imagine how hard this would be. But we were managing. We were trying.  And in november I went to Spain to go visit him and everything seemed normal. But About a month ago he out of the blue dumped me. It was over text. He had called me earlier that day telling me he missed me and that he loved me. Then a couple hours later I got a text that turned my whole world upside down. 

I feel like a total wreck. It was so unexpected that I still have a hard time believing it. He left for sea shortly after and I've spent the better part of this month trying to survive. And while everyone around me has been supper supportive, I've never felt more alone. All I want is Christian.  And I want him to make the hurt go away like he always does. But now it's my turn to make myself happy.  And i don't know how. 

He comes home for semester break in 4 days and I'm not handling it very well. I don't want him to come back because just the thought of him in the same town makes me spiral out of control. 

This is the first time that I'll be able to focus on me without ever thinking of someone else when I make decisions. While I should be happy because it's a new chapter... I'm starting school..  moved into my first home... I've never felt more alone and empty. And the only thing that's been getting me through my day and keeping me asleep at night is my constant supply of weed. 

I literally have to stay high all the time in order to make it through the day. I have a therapist. I have a family. But I can't talk to anyone. I'm scared to open up because once I do I'm afraid I'll never stop crying.  

The worst part is he asked to see me when he's home so we can give our stuff back to each other. And talk about moving on. But I've let myself go so badly that im embarassrd to see him. I've gained over 20 pounds since I saw him in november. I don't want him to know I'm suffering. Or to know I'm dying on the onside.  But he will know as soon as he sees me. I'm an emotional eater. 

I'm scared. I'm lost. And I don't know how to move on. I just need someone to tell me that im going to be okay. 

Tldr; my boyfriend dumped my ass leaving me feeling alone and unsure of how to find myself and heal.

"It'll be 2017 in 49 minutes.

What a year 2016 has been. I lost my girlfriend of almost three years. The business I tried to get going failed before it even started. I got back in touch with the one girl I ever truely loved. Now we don't talk to each other anymore - but at least she found her someone, and she's doing better now. I'm not.

I don't have any friends to get drunk with tonight. So I'll be hitting the gin on my own until I pass out and hopefully I'll choke on my own vomit. But I digress.

What I was trying to say, apart from telling the whole world 'O how I'm sad, is that I know plenty of you guys and girls are in the same position. Remembering that we're together in our loneliness is creepily heartwarming.

Here's to hoping for a better 2017 - but it won't happen, right? So let's hope we find bliss in our sleep never waking up again.

This isn't really by choice it just seems I can never get close to more than 2 or 3 people at a time. Anywho, both of them moved really far away in the last few weeks. The only people I was going to have to spend New Years with were my parents and as a 27 year old that is already depressing but now they won't even make it home till tomorrow night due some travel mishaps.

If that's the case and she claims she loves this guy then what the fuck is going on? I can't keep doing this, she's put me through so much shit.

"I met this guy 2 years ago with whom I became best friend (although honestly I probably fell in love with him). He got back with his ex last year and since then I've just been spiralling down. When we're together, he keeps texting with his bf, and we barely have interesting conversations (we used to always hang out together and talk about everything). He keeps saying that he's my best friend, and he keeps saying that I'm very special to him, but he doesn't really act that way. Their relationship is long-distance and when he's with his boyfriend he barely texts me.

I tried distancing myself, but he's scared he's gonna lose me so he doesn't give me a lot of space. I spent last January-March severely depressed and ended up seeing a therapist. I managed to get out of the darkness, but these days I've been faltering. Especially since he's with him now for NYE and I'm stuck with my parents and I don't expect myself having a good time...

Lately we haven't spoke much and I was getting him out of my mind, but he sent me a picture of a gift his boyfriend gave him yesterday and my heart has been turned around. I feel like there's a hole, and yet everything is very heavy... I'm getting the same feeling I had when I was depressed. I keep getting the feeling I should simply ""break up"" with him, just tell him to go away, but when I think about that I start choking up and my chest just gets heavier.

Sorry this post is sort of messy and all over the place, I just needed to vent... It's hard, very hard.

"I just have no enjoyment in life anymore. I got out of a 6 year relationship about 2 months ago where I was cheated on. My confidence is rock bottom. I don't like the way I look. I have neglected my friends so I feel very alone. I am about to finish uni and I don't know what I want with my life now that the plans I made with my ex have all fallen through. I know that others value me but I don't value myself. 

I keep thinking about my last relationship and about everything I lost. I still can't understand how my ex could have cheated. It was so out of character and we had both agreed on numerous occasions that cheating was the most despicable thing you could do to a person. I want someone to fill the gap in my life which is loving someone and being loved but I have no idea if that will ever happen again which just adds to the feeling of hopelessness. Now I'm finishing uni I don't even know where I'd even meet someone new.

I tell myself that I am not depressed because I can snap myself out of the sinking feeling and sickness in the pit of my stomach but the fact that I keep returning to this feeling is starting to worry me. I want to say I can over-ride how I am feeling and logic my way out of it. I know that the way I am feeling is chemicals in my brain and how it's irrational and all the rest of it but understanding why I feel shit doesn't stop me feeling shit. 

I am making a conscious effort to speak to new people, to do new things and not to wallow in self pity but right now there are so few things to be excited or happy about and I am grasping at every little thing. Fake it till you make it though I guess.

"Something that has begun recently in the last 2 years is my overwhelming depression. I have a friend who lets just call Tyler. Its not his real name. A girlfriend called.... Maria? Sounds good. And a best friend lets call Shana. For the longest time I never had a depressed state, even when I was in high school. I always seemed to just be doing fine and that's mostly because I was good at something. Video games have been my life, they used to become my cherished center where I could always go to escape life for a few good hours and come back refreshed. Where I had so much fun seeing developers make these stunning worlds and querky characters. It gave me the best years of my life, now its become a hellscape of depression and sorrow. 

Not all games, Undertale was a big helper in my dark times. Yet to this day most games give me this bitter feeling. So the reason why is im not good at anything, nothing at all. In real life I have no talent. In my job im seen as the weakest link (in all 7 which i got fired from my last recently) because I am physically weak. I have an issue where I am unable to remember simple things but can remember the most complex passwords. I can't even remember my own name some days and I actually stand there thinking about it. I have no money and nor do I care but I was made fun of it alot. So video games was my big deal right? Unfortunately as of late my friends became so engrossingly good at it i can't deal with it.

My girlfriend can beat me at everything. Were having fun and I think its going to be a good time so we play Battleblock Theater for example. She always gets to the end on every single level, and gets most if not all the gems first. She uses these weird tricks and the thing is she has no previous experience before.....but she always wins. So much so she apologizes for it and rubs it in by saying shell let me go ahead..... like im a stupid child. Tyler on the other hand beats me at everything as well and makes it worse. Say a game like God Eater. I practice against a monster maybe 30 to 40 times. I even spent an entire day trying to master this fight against 1 creature. So game comes down and were playing with another friend but I die not once but 6 times. Hes laughing at me saying its easy and im a loser for dieing. He laughed even more pointing out he got an SSS rank (the highest) while i got a B..... cause i died entirely. I also play games like Overwatch and Killing Floor and even on those games he gets golds across the board and recently after losing on God Eater he flat out said ""Why do we even have you here?"" refering to our new friend getting the game, so he kicked me out and just now as I type they are all beating the final boss of the game with the new guy proving hes completely surpassed me....he uses my same weapon and all and called me ""Useless"" and saying ""I should kill myself"" .....i should, I truely believe failures like me should be euthanised. Make room for the great and the growing. If you have nothing at my age of 24 you should be removed from this earth and ground into fodder. im useless im garbage i hate myself i hate living and i hate freaking everything now, my life is just filled with failures and holding everyone back and im not good at a single thing no matter how hard i try or cry or sweat or work and nothing ever works out and even if i practice ghours after hours i alwys end up just being last dead last i want to win once i want someone to say i fucing matter at anything! WHY DO I TRY IF ALL I WILL DO IS LOSE EVERY TIME AND HAVE EVERYONE HATE ME BECAUSE IM A LOSER WHY CANT I JUST DIE AND BE DONE WITH IT!?",4,"girlfriend can beat me at everything, so she apologizes for it and rub it in saying she will let me go ahead like I were some stupid child, you are a loser, why do we even have you here?"
"I'm new to reddit as of today. Recently, my depression has been super bad and I've been hoping for some other support besides the usual ""but your life seems to be going well"" and ""dont be to hard on yourself"" that I get from my parents. I dont really have anyone I feel I can connect to, so hopefully I can find someone here that is going through something similar. The few people ive talked to about it tell me that I have no reason to be sad because Im super high in my class rank, get high grades, got into a college with some big scholarships, and have been first chair hornist in my school band (or they say im just stressed out, which i am, but its just adding to my depression and making me feel even worse). Truth is, I have never really fit in or connected with anyone at school, leaving me with many shallow friendships and no one I feel I can trust. Work isnt any better either. Minimum wage for a shitty retail job and the only coworker who i got close to and who could understand me refuses to talk to me now for literally no reason given. Hell, im only 17 and I already feel stuck in an endless cycle of anger and disappointment that im going to be in stuck in for 2017 and the rest of my fucking life.

"In twenty-five years of existence, 2016 has had to have been the worst year of my life. I have lost nearly every friend that was truly dear to me when the year started. One stole a pretty substantial amount of money from me, another was that ones twin, another ridiculed and belittled me behind my back to try to get into bed with an ex of mine, etc. Although, a woe from the year before, I am also dealing with my best friend marring and moving across the country. Any thing even remotely romance related is a self destructive mess. I was introduced to a young women and her young son back in July. We talked for a while and I was instantly head over heels for this girl. The first person I had really been interested in after calling off an engagement in early 2015. I proceed to spend the next six months busting my ass for someone that only sees me when it is convenient to her, under the self illusion that she had just been burnt to many time and had suffered a rough enough home life that she would just take time to warm her up to the idea of something steady. She has done me wrong some many times in that time that I've lost count. Last week she calls me wanting help because they have no where to go. What can i do, put a two year old on the street? The entire time up until last night has been decent, then she drops on me that some guy is blowing her up because they went on one date and she won't go on another. Mind you, in the time I've know her, she's bailed on every single date we have had planned that involved anything more than hanging out at my place. We had plans for me to take them out to dinner tonight. Where am I? At home, with a bourbon on the rocks, being a burden on the rest of the Reddit society on New Years. Mean while, she is out with her ""friends"" and wont respond to anything. So, cheers to 2017. I hope for a fantastic year to anyone who has sat through my tears and maybe one not so destructive for myself.

"According to Spotify, I was in the top 1% of listeners for Counting Crows and The National for the year. That got me thinking and I realized, I only ever feel to music. Here's a few songs that I really connect with and maybe we can swap songs or something?

**Possibility Days by Counting Crows**

&gt; Now ""living in smiles is better"", you say but we carry the burdens of all of our days, so I'm scared that youâll leave and youâre scared that I'll stay. It's an impossibility day, but we only say half the ballet.

also

&gt; I said, ""good night, goodbye""
Seems like a good thing,
So you know it's a good lie.
You can run out of choices
And still hear a voice in your head
When youâre lying in bed and it says that the best part of a bad day
Is knowing it's ok;
The color of everything changes,
The sky rearranges its shade,
And your smile doesnât fade,
Into a phone call
And one bad decision we made.

I view that last section as the voice you use to lie to yourself, trying to make yourself feel less like shit. The former section is how I feel about friendships that shattered when they found out I have depression, or if they don't explicitly know then how they treat me on my awful days.

**The Watchmaker by Steven Wilson**

&gt; Eliza, dear, you know there's something I must say. I've never really loved you but I'll miss you anyway...

also

&gt; You were just meant to be temporary while I waited for gold. Then we counted the years and I found I liked having someone to hold. But for you I had to wait, until one day it was too late.

I've had relationships where I didn't really feel for the other person, but just kept going because having someone there is nice. I regret both of these and this song really highlights that regret to me.

**Shemovedon by Porcupine Tree**

&gt; So for a while, everything seemed new. Did we connect, or was it just biding time for you?

&gt; She changes every time you look. By summer it was all gone, now she's moved on. She called you every other day so savor it it's all gone, cause she's moved on.

I connect this song very vividly to a girl I knew who feigned interest in even just a friendship. I thought we had something and formed a strong crush on her but she started getting cold. I confronted her multiple times but she kept hold the position that it was all okay. Eventually I got confirmation that she was avoiding any conversations with only me, and I confronted her last time and just got the message, ""I'm sorry."" Now thanks to a unique name, every time I even see her name somewhere it feels like a punch to my gut. So this song makes me extremely emotional, especially the guitar solo.

___
**Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks by The National**

&gt; Vanderlyle, crybaby cry. Oh the waters a rising, still no surprising you. Vanderlyle, crybaby cry. Man, it's all been forgiven, swans are a-swimmin'. I'll explain everything to the geeks.

I listened to this album around when I was 12 (yet to deal with depression) and fell in love with it. This was always my favorite song off it and never really knew why. I still don't really know why but have at least kind of a reason. It's one of the few where I can bawl my eyes out to any day. Just the chorus gives a kind of soothing, understanding, almost loving feel? It's just pleasant.

Plus it live [is a tearjerker like no other and on my bucket list to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpRRRwCVsic)

"So at least i made it this far, finally writing something here after lurking for a long time. 

I'm not entirely sure why I am so sad all the time, there is almost nothing in my life I feel I can complain about. I was never bullied, I have a loving supportive family, haven't been sick in a few years so somewhat healthy(although i drink a lot of coke), average intellect, average height, skinny. I have such low interest in things that my little income is way higher than rent+food. I went to the movies 2x this whole year, no hobbies to speak of (Watching TV shows and browsing the internet is barely a hobby).

I tried finishing my Computer Science degree at some point but every year went something like: School-&gt;Work during summer-&gt;Some school-&gt;Depression-&gt;Quit school. Had quite a few hobbies that started out fun and engaging but then got boring fast so I found another one. Now I feel like I have spent all my options for short-time happiness and I'm getting closer to the deep end of depression.

Everything I used to love to do just seems pointless right now, everything I aspired to be has vanished, I'm still fairly young(almost 30) but feels like life is passing me by. I have never had a partner or even kissed someone and people around me are having kids and successful careers.
I have now had a stable job for a year and it is killing me. I hate that job because I find it so meaningless, it's just an entry level IT job but deep down I feel like I should be doing something else. My friend recommended me for that job and now they are firing him because I have a little more education than him. That has not made our relationship stronger, he says it's no big deal but I can't but blame myself somehow, and I can't just quit because the rent would eventually eat my reserves and I would have to move back to my mother.

I don't know where this rant is going, just feeling quite bad that another year has gone by and I'm going less and less out of the house. Depression has hit like a truck over the holidays and I'm having a hard time seeing anything positive happening in the near future.

Happy new year woop woop",4,"I have never had a partner or even kissed someone and people around me are having kids and successful ca,. That has not made our relationship strongerreers."
"So, been a long time since I posted (used throwaway but now I don't care) Basically, I was really depressed, I self harmed and attempted suicide once. After a while I decided I needed some company so I got a girlfriend. That in itself is an issue so I'll summarize it. She and I were happy but she said she was still in love with her ex. Thats when I realized I wasn't really happy with her. I broke up with her and was genuinely happy. This was about a mont and a half ago. Depression was gone and I was the best I could be. Then my friends started saying shit behind my back, that I was a fake and didn't have individuality. Basically mean things. Besides my friends were still (and still are) best friends with my ex. Like all of them.I started becoming left out. they stopped talking to me. (Literally the only chat I have with another person is my one true friend (Who doesn't respond to any of my messages even though he talks in groups) the rest I haven't had a chat since beginning of december) I keep telling myself that its okey. That I don't need them. I am probably right, But it feels really shitty. And to top it all of, my depression is coming back. I can feel it creeping up.


Thanks for reading all this, You are probably the first people to care for me since vacations started.


tl;dr friends ditched me, depression is coming back. ",4,"I broke up with her, friends started saying things behind my back,,friends ditched me"
"I posted about an hour ago in r/relationships about a situation with my roommate where he owes me $1000 in unpaid debt, and I told his mom about it when she came to visit.

Most people sided with me, and told me I was right to do what I did. This was a great boost of confidence, and I finally felt certainty in my actions after all the apprehension I've felt while dealing with my roommate's failure to pay his bills. 

Tonight, I decided to tell my Mom, Dad, and sister about my decision, certain that they would finally side with me and praise me for doing the right thing, and being assertive. I know that in the past they have sympathized with my roommate, but I wanted them to see once and for all that I'm not the bad guy for wanting to take him to court, or to tell his parents about the massive debt that he owes me.

Their reactions were...not good.

My mom buried her face in her hand and said, ""You *really* shouldn't have done that.""

My Dad fell silent, and didn't say anything. He had a look on his face that said, ""You fucked up"", though.

I started rattling off stuff that people told me on Reddit about how right this decision was, and how I'm doing the right thing, about how great it was that I was finally taking action, etc.

My sister stopped me though, and she looked at me angrily and said in a sarcastic tone, ""Wow, congratulations! Getting validation from strangers on the internet really makes you confident in yourself, huh?""

Why doesn't she see how right I am? This whole situation with my roommate is cut-and-dry, and I'm taking the necessary steps to fix it. 

I started reciting some of the answers I got (they were really well-written), but the more I spoke, the more angrier they got, until my sister's eyes bore into me like daggers, and my Mom was sort of just standing there laughing, in an exhausted kind of way. ""There's no going back now."" she said in a defeated tone of voice. ""What's done is done. You let random internet people tell you what to do instead of us, and you're going to feel the consequences of that decision very soon.""

My voice cracked a little as I desperately tried to convince them to side with me, until Dad said, ""That's enough. We're not talking about this anymore. You're making your Mom upset.""

Why can't my family just be proud of me? I'm clearly, *clearly* doing the right thing here, and yet my parents seem to be more concerned about preserving the peace with my deadbeat roommate than getting my money back. Their *son's* money! I'm the one they should feel sorry for, not him.

A lot of people in that Reddit thread told me that I care way too much about what my family thinks, and I agree whole-heartedly. I don't know how to stop caring about what they think, because right now, they're all I've got. I don't really have any good friends who will talk to me about life situations without tuning out, or ignoring me. I've never dealt with difficult life situations like this before, and I need all the support I can get. I try to do all the right things, all the time, and I can't please them or make them happy. Nothing is ever good enough. I apologize if I sound dramatic, but these emotions have a firm hold on me and I can't make them stop. 

I want people to know how much my parent's disapproval means to me. I know I shouldn't care, but I do. I might need some advice on how to stop caring what they think, because tonight, I felt like I *needed* them to tell me that I made the right decision, because I will be dealing with a pissed-off roommate for two months, and it would really help to have people in my corner to tell me that I'm not the bad person that my roommate is making me out to be.",4,"sister stopped me though, and she looked at me angrily and said in a sarcastic tone, ""Wow, congratulations! Getting validation from strangers on the internet really makes you confident in yourself, I care way too much about what my family thinks, and I agree whole-heartedly."
"My parents and little sister left an hour ago to go to a party. Im home alone and have been walking around my house picking out spots in the house that are capable of holding a 180 lb male. I dont even know how to tie a noose and im going around laughing at myself while saying ""Thats no strong enough"" or ""That could probably hold my weight"". I got rejected a couple hours ago to someone who i now realize doesnt care about me. She claims to but I know she doesnt. She acts just like how Ive been acting for the past 4 years pretending to be happy whenever someone else is present. I don't think my parents would care if I did rid myself, every night I hear them talking about how stupid and worthless I am but during the day they pretend like they care alot. I know they dont. Funny thing is whenever I think about ending myself I dont get sad. I feel some kind of joy, some kind of hope. I have attempted to take my life 5 times so far (I will spare you details) however I have a different feeling about attempt #6. I think it might actually work, which makes me happier than almost everything else. I am lucky to go 5 minutes without thinking of suicide. I have an amazing life that people would kill for yet I feel empty inside. I have ""friends"" but I can tell that they don't care about me",4,"I got rejected a couple of hours ago, dont think parents wou;ld vcare if I rid myself"
"I hate when my family teases me about being a drama queen because I constantly cry and feel angry. They don't know how I feel in the inside, but I'm too scared to tell them.",4,hate when family tease me about being a drama queen
"Me (19M) was just cheated on by my girlfriend (19F) of two years. I don't know what to feel right now. 

Edit: typo on the title.",4,just cheated on by my girlfriend
"So this is what happened in the past 6 months:

1. Lost my car to a hit and run
2. Lost my job due to an illness that's out of my control
3. Had emergency surgery to remove appendix and ended up staying in the hospital 3 days due to complications
4. Instead of visiting me, girlfriend dumps me the day I leave the hospital

I just need to build up the courage of not caring about others and how this might effect them. This world can't hurt me anymore if I don't let it. 

This whole things is after 3 of the worst years of my life. I thought my girlfriend and I were going to make it and someday get married, but that was also a lie... 

This world is just not meant for me, and I can't wait I finally get the courage to check out permanently! 

Hopefully I can do it before 2017. Otherwise I've failed something else I said I'd do. 

I needed to put this out there so at lease I can go with a clear conscience. Thanks for listening, and good luck with your own battles.",4,"lost job due to illness, girlfrind dumped me, I thought my girlfriend and I were gooing to marry but it was a lie"
"I finally got the guts to post this, especially because I just came from a new years eve party and it's 4.33 AM and i'm just in a 'fuck it' kind of mode, I need some motivational help.

I feel like im a fucking failure at everything I do, I just turned 18 2 days ago, and time keeps going and going yet it seems I'm always in the same shitty place.
I don't feel okay with myself, i'm kinda short, i'm chubby, and let's face it, no girl wants a guy like that in her life. I just got home from a party just like I said, went over to have fun with some college friends (crush included) and hey, look at that, she's drunk and is spewing the truth through her mouth left and right. I've been 2 months so far gathering courage to just talk to her directly ( we have a group chat on facebook and we talk daily, 24/7 ) and do something about but there's always that mental block of 'hey she doesnt want you you're a loser look at you', and when I finally am about to do something about it, she just starts talking about how 'she misses *name_from_guy_from_our_groupchat *' and shit like that. All that built up courage went down in mere seconds.

And it's not even the first time this happens, I've been this whole summer talking to one of the best girls i've ever met (we know each other for like 4 years but we only talked more seriously this year) and it really felt like she was the one but then again, all that courage i've been building that whole time back then went down again the moment I knew I wasn't going anywhere, seems like I was being friendzoned.
We still talk, I even met her again today in the new years eve party after I left my college friends, but it seems like one day she really likes me but then other days she just ignores me completely, like for example, she gets really pumped up and invites me to the cinema but then she cancels the next day, i don't know her deal. 

I think I'm way too nice and caring but that's just the way I am and I can't stop it that easily, but it's FUCKING up my relationships with girls because I want to be with them but they just assume i'm their good kind friend who doesn't want anything.

I always get motivated and say to myself 'This is the day/month/year, that everything changes, from now on, I'll go to the gym everytime I can and start acting a different way with people blablabla', it works for the first few days or weeks, but it just burns down completely and I end up doing nothing. Endless loop. 

People say you gotta love yourself before you love others, I really need help loving myself then, because I just feel like time is flying away and I'll end up dying single, which is literally hell for me because I care so much about relationships and friends. I'm really grateful for the friends I have, but I just want that one special person to share all my moments with...",4,"I'm short and chibby, gathering courage to talk to her directly, she dosent want you, friendzoned"
"dsAIm 18, about to be 19 in a month (Feb.1) and a male, if that matters. 

As im posting this its currently 11:50 PM right before the new year. Both my brother and my sister are out at seperate parties, while im alone in my room. I have no connection to my parents, i feel so alone on new years eve when everyone else is having fun. All my friends left for college and havnt kept in touch, and my only online friends are all increasingly harder to reach. I feel like i only push those closest to me away when i try talking to them about how i feel. I never go out and do anything, im either at home or work, and even though me and my brother are ""friends"" and his friends accept me when they come over, they never invite me anywhere, and i feel awkward asking if i can tag along. My mom rarely talks to me, my dad isnt good at being supportive (to say the least) my stepmom hates me one day and acts like were friends the next. When they try to encourage me to better myself its always in a degrading way, ""youll be 300 pounds if you dont change the way you eat, look at yourself."" ""You need to eat less"" ""youre a terrible driver"" things like that. Im not too fat imo but im not thin either, i have manboobs and i hate them, and i genuinely want to better myself, but its hard without support. For the past week or so ive just wanted to curl up in my bed and cry, and its only as im typing this post that im finally getting that release, i genuinely dont know where else to turn. I have an overwhelming fear of there being no afterlife and just nothingness after death that cripples me and keeps me awake at night which no one ive talked to yet acknowledges. I just feel like im in a shitshow and i have no one here to help me through it, and all i want is to be happy but it feels like that just isnt possible for me. Sometimes i think im happy for a bit, but i feel like ive just gotten so good at pretending that i even fool myself sometimes. All this is made worse by the fact that right before my friends left, for about 2 months i was genuinely happy, we all went out and did things and it was fun, but then they all left, and now i feel like that little taste of happiness only makes this pain worse because i know what true happiness feels like, and i feel like i can never achieve it again.",4,"bother and sister are out at separate parties, I feel so alone,  mom rarely talks to me, dad isnt good at being supportive ,stepmom hates me"
Woohoo. Got blown off by the same girl two nights in a row. I don't know why I expected anything good to happen to me. Really hope 2017 is my last year.,4,blown off by the same girl two nights in  a row
