"I unsubscribed from suicide related forums, because overall atmosphere was so self-centered, full of anger and hatred.

Yes I understand, I and they are all frustrated to the level of thinking suicide, it'll be too much to expect civilized response from them or me.

But the extreme selfishness wore me quickly. 'I'm so depressed, I'm going to bitch at you and you're gonna just have to take it.'

Well, I'm starting to think I might not be a terrible scum of Earth as I used to think, because I don't wanna do that to others.
(though I may have done that sometimes without knowing)

It's strange that I can't stand fellow suicidal people, the extreme bitterness and aggressiveness I also have.

"Hi, 

I am no stranger to depression my self but am having a lot of current difficulties with helping my wife through hers. As I'm sure your all know what works for one person may not work for the next. Nor is it easy to know exactly what will help the best, especially when the depression hinders the sufferer from understanding their own needs, being able to express them and sometimes even not being able to accept the help even if it is exactly what they were asking for.

I love my wife deeply and would love to help her in any way that I can. I think I need a bit of a different perspective on this. Is there anyone out there that is willing to share what works for them as ""depressies"" or caregivers.",4,love my wife deeply and would love to help her in any way that I can
"It's weird because in middle school, I had friends. I attended a different high school than the rest of my friends, so I talked to them less. I started having social anxiety problems around this time as well. Most of my friends started experimenting with drugs and alcohol, but I knew that wasn't for me. Still my social anxiety made me think that because I was different than them in that way, they wouldn't like me as much. I was also scared they'd pressure me into doing it with them. So I started to socially isolate myself. I'm in college now, and I really don't talk to anyone besides my family. I have two people I talk to at my job, but we don't hang out outside of work. I've learned how to keep myself entertained, but now I long for companionship. I still sometimes struggle with my social anxiety and am afraid of putting myself out there only to push people away like I did before. Also I'm kinda shy so it's hard to talk to people lol. Anyone else out there a loner feeling a little lonesome? I'm new to redditt, so I'm hoping I did this right.

"I donât remember exactly when it started, but I do remember all those lonely walks home from school. I remember picking up snow and see it melt in my hand and I would tell myself that it was me. I was about 11 I think. 

It all turned worse once I got in my teens. I sort of just lived thru it and yes I made my parents life a living hell by being angry. Today I believe that was all a cry for help. I did a lot of weird shit, some weird relationships. But I always worked and maintained a job. All the time. I did all my chores and I tried I really did. 

Then you turn 18 and your supposed to start living. I left to work in FL, didnât work and moved back to Europe. A lot back and forth and finally decided to be a nurse because of pressure from my parents. At this point I was angry all the time again, but I worked hard to maintain composure and let it all out while I was alone and yes I was alone a lot of the time. 

I met my husband (just got married on Friday) and I thought life would finally make a turn for the better. We decided to move FL after some months in Europe and I was for once excited about life. FL didnât really work out because school was not what I thought it was. 

So now we live back in Europe under my parents roof until we find an apartment and yesterday it all came crashing down again. 

I have always been thought to speak my mind if something is not right. Iâm 22 turning 23 this year and Iâm still being treated as a child. My own father stood and watched me cry and told me I never did anything right and that Iâm an embarrassment to the family. I have learned to control my temper, but I am a loud and sarcastic person and maybe sometimes that doesnât work. 

It all came crashing down yesterday and I havenât felt this bad in years. I told my father I wanted to see a shrink, but he laughed at me and told me to grow a pair. He told me that nothing I do is ever good enough and that Iâm just rude. 

I donât know what more to do. I do everything they tell me. I go to school and I work. I smile and try to be funny. I guess the voice was right. I was never good enough and I never will be. ",4,sort of just lived thru it and yes I made my parents life a living hell by being angry
"I feel bad bc I had to turn away the pest control guy today bc my apt was too messy. The last time the pest control people came apparently they complained to my landlord bc the apt was so messy, and then the landlord sent an email scolding me. It pisses me off bc imo as long as I'm not doing any structural or permanent damage to the property I should be able to live in filth if I want to. But I also know that the way I'm living now isn't healthy. I'm just reluctant to clean bc cleaning up would require admitting to myself that the way I'm living now isn't normal or good for me. 

I also find it difficult to eat. I keep cooking too much pasta, realizing I don't want to eat (even when I'm hungry), and leaving it out to stick to the pan or rot. (Yep, turns out if you leave pasta in the sink for a while green stuff will grow all over it!) I think it's partly bc I like the light-headed feeling of not eating enough and drinking too much coffee. It's basically a cheap and easy way to get high. But lately whenever I ""eat well"" I end up getting intense stomachaches anyway. I had a steak yesterday bc I knew I needed protein but I ended up just getting stomach cramps and diarrhea. 

My dad died when I was young and my mom went back to work. She would always have to get up early and would get mad at me for making dinner late (I've always been a night owl) or not doing the dishes. In retrospect I totally understand why she'd get so mad (I *was* being disrespectful) but basically it just made me feel intense shame and that everything I do in the kitchen is basically filthy and gross. Also if I i.e. washed the dishes but didn't put them in the dishwasher she'd get just as mad and I think I unconsciously internalized that unless I completely clean up the kitchen I may as well just let everything sit around and rot. 

My main motivation to clean up would be so I could have friends over without feeling ashamed. (So far I've only let one person who I trust see my apt and I still felt like a gross weirdo.) 

The thing is actually I find dish-washing very calmly sometimes. I've found that concentrating on thinking about the process and how cleaning dishes is satisfying makes me want to clean a lot more than beating myself up about how everything is disgusting. 

Anyway does anyone have any advice for getting yourself to clean things up beyond ""break it into small steps"" ",4,"My dad died when I was young and my mom went back to work, She would always have to get up early and would get mad at me for making dinner late (I've always been a night owl) or not doing the dishes"

"So I heard that I should find a creative outlet to help cope with my depression...
I've been suicidal for 5 years, pretty much as long as I've been depressed.
Im to cowardly to actually do it but I just kind of wanna stop existing, I'm just extremely sad although I don't fully understand why.
So I'm kind of by myself venting because nobody really cares, I spend most of everyday just talking to myself... Mostly self hatred negative thoughts and I guess I'm a small cause of my depression.
So I'm kind of just looking for a creative outlet to let out my sadness and depression, so I have like three ideas for it. One of my major ways of coping with depression is joking about it, it has become a really good coping strategy believe it or not.
I wanted to do a couple things
1 I wanted to start a YouTube channel
2 I wanted to start publishing my art
3 I wanted to start animating

I really enjoy drawing, I love it and it's a form of coping for me.
YouTube is kind of just something for me to not feel alone, I probably won't actually do it though I just think it'd be interesting to get like minded depressed people to kind of hang out idk but there is a lot of us that seem to relate easily.
Animating has always been kind of cool, I love adventure Time and Rick and Morty, although it's kind of expensive at first I think it'd be a fun hobby for me to invest in.

Do you guys have any tips though, im just trying to keep my head up as long as possible without breaking down.

"Here's my story,
I have recently turned fourteen and I've recently noticed some really weird changes in my feelings and my behaviors.  I'm not sure where to start so I will try to explain my emotional state recently.
Some pretty weird things have been happeing to me latley and I'm not so sure what to think of them.  I've started having these ""episodes"" where I get super upset for no reason (the no reason is actually another problem I've been having which I will get into in just a second) and I'll just start ignoring people who text me which makes them worried and super upset.  And the ""no reason"" has been a super big problem for me and that problem is when other people treat me indifferently?  Its like when someone talks to me and they'll talk to me in a way that makes them seem like they don't care about me (now I want to adress that this is indeed an incredibly selfish point of view but I don't know how to work on it and make it stop or go away) and it makes me feel like total shit and just start hating everthing.  
I've also noticed that I have barley eaten, which is a pretty normal thing for me because I'm super fucking picky and only eat like snack foods french fries and mcdonalds, but now I'm actually getting scared for myself like today I was basically starving so I went to make waffles at 2 fucking AM.  I'm also aware that not eating is a sign of depression which is kinda scary to me as well because I fell like theres a super high chance that I'm depressed but I do not fucking believe it what so ever. 
I hate trying to talk about how I feel about this stuff to other people because I always feel like its me begging for attention because I'm in eighth grade and I'm used to people talking about their ""depression"" for no reason other than attention.  So I always feel like talking about it is just begging for attention (even though that is a stupid way to look at things because people with real depression do need to communicate and get help) and I always feel bad talking to people about it. 
I really don't know what to do and would like some advice and/or help with this.  I'm also aware that I'm not a very good writer so some of these things lack detail and might just be out of order or not make any sense so if you have any questions fell free to ask so I can try and get you information that you need.

"Hi all, 

I am a 20 year old male in college and I have been going through an especially hard time lately, so I wanted to share my story with depression and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. My hope is that my writing this out I can relieve some pain and maybe if anyone else is struggling with something similar they can feel comfort knowing they are not alone. I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 7 years old, after I got a strep throat infection I started experiencing symptoms of the disorder such as ticks (biting my shirt, blinking my eyes excessively, craning my neck a certain way a lot). I worried about little things, such as if there was a seam on my sock or a tag on my shirt, I would feel so much discomfort that I could not wear it. When I worried about things, sometimes I felt pains in either side of my body, if I didn't feel the pain in the other side of my body it felt wrong and the decision I made in my head felt wrong.

Anyway, my ticks got worse after taking a certain medication that I forget the name of, and then they got better after I got off it. I started having more rituals, like washing my hands and walking across mirrors multiple times to get it ""right"". This later turned into more obsessive thoughts, which are what I primarily suffer from now. I am not in therapy right now and I am not taking any medication. In high school, I feel like I was happier because I had a small group of friends and a best friend who was a girl that I loved. A year later, I did not talk to any of those friends including that girl because she did not reciprocate feelings and we stopped talking to each other soon after that. This was really hard for me at the time, she was so funny and genuinely nice I thought, she was absolutely beautiful and I took her to prom which was a shitty night because she ignored me most of the night. I ignored that red flag, and many others, I was 18 and I had never been in a relationship before and I fell for her hard.

After we stopped talking to each other, which was around December of 2016, I believe she texted me out of the blue in March of last year and we chatted a bit. That was all the contact we had until we saw each other at school when the semester started 4 months ago because she goes to the same college I do. It was good to see her, she told me she had a boyfriend that she broke up and he was an asshole, I had never met him. At the time I told myself that was okay she had moved on, I accepted that she was changing on and that I could move on too. I underestimated my feelings though because I ended up texting her and apologizing to her for whatever reason, and she apologized too. Things were well and good until I found out she had another boyfriend through a story she posted on Snapchat, and I freaked out. I blocked her phone number, Snapchat, Instagram and everything. I completely cut contact with her for 4 months. Until 2 weeks ago, and we had a great time recently as friends but she cut me off again and I don't know if I deserve it or not but it makes me feel bad of course.

I have a part time job, but it's not enough hours and I am going to see if I can't get more or maybe find something to do on the side. It makes me feel worse to not work or go to school and be around other people, I do not have any friends now, and I have been crying over something every day in recent months because of my depression. My family does not think I have depression, my mom has the key on the gate because she had postpartum depression and according to her that was real depression but not mine. I am just ""stir crazy"" from not working, and she is pushing me to get another job. When she says that to me it makes me feel invalid and worthless, which I feel like anyway pretty much anyway, I love her but I hate it when she makes me feel this way about myself. My dad does not think too much about my mental health, and neither does my mom's boyfriend.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my story with you all. It made me feel better to type it out as I have been having an extremely hard week. I was on a high because my best friend and I started talking again and spending time together 2 weeks ago, now she is ignoring me and I am not sure why. Now I have been crying just about every hour of every day and out of the past 48 hours I have probably slept through 20 of those hours. I hurt myself again and have been treating the wounds but they were stinging so bad sometimes. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.",4,did not talk to any of those friends including that girl because she did not reciprocate feelings and we stopped talking to each other soon after that

I get depressed every now and then; one could say that is quite normal and everyone does. But one thing that I don't think is normal is that I've never, ever been truly happy. I know that there are people that wake up in the morning and can't help but smile because their life is awesome and they feel incredibly happy. With most people it's because of a certain thing that they have that keeps their spirits high. Perhaps it's a wonderful significant other that makes them feel like they won the lottery. Perhaps they are blessed with astonishingly good looks or intelligence. With many, it could just be that you have good family and friends to pick you up. 

I have virtually none of these things. I have no reason to be happy. And I never have been. I can't recall in recent memory ever being in an uplifting mood one could deem happy. In fact, I'm aware and those close to me are aware of the fact that I am almost completely emotionally numb. I don't feel happy or sad or mad 90 percent of the time. Terrible things will happen, such as a family member passing away, and I won't feel any remorse. 

I know that this is likely just another one of those intermittent batches of depression, but I can't help but feel that this is the truth. I'm a pathetic, broken man that doesn't really have a reason to wake up happy. 

I'm not sure what I'm trying to get out of this post. Maybe to see if others have felt the same? Does anyone else feel emotionally numb? Does anyone else find looking at others happiness depressing? Does anyone else feel that they've never been happy? Because at times it feels like I'm the only one on Earth that does.

"Hi, I'm 17, male, and I've been having depressed thoughts for about a year now (not sure if that qualifies as having depression). I have friends, but I'm constantly scared that they don't actually like me and when they do i assume they're lying (i have been lied to about that in the past and that makes it hard to trust them). Im not close with any of them after they all turned on me when someone spread rumors about me once (long story, we sorted it out but i don't feel right about them after they hated me so quickly without question). 

I'm constantly terrified of being too obsessive around the people i like and driving them away, and that I'm way too desperate for a friendship or relationship i can feel good about. I get extremely self loathing around them and this causes those who i am close with to get annoyed at me i think. Im scared of opening up to anyone about how bad my self hatred has gotten because theyll just think it's juvenile (not sure about that myself tbh) or whether it's just me fishing for sympathy. I try to be nice to people but i think i take it to an extreme and be too apologetic of anything i think may annoy someone slightly. I have no idea what to do with myself so i read or play games to turn my brain off so i don't have to think about anything. 

 I wish i could talk to someone about it all since it makes me feel better but i feel like they'll just be annoyed at me for wasting their time. I constantly have this feeling in my chest of worthlessness that i feel physically, it keeps me awake at night and wears me down. I never used to consider suicide until a few months back, but now these thoughts are getting more and more frequent until I'm thinking them every day. I just want to make this feeling go away and I'll do anything to make it happen. I'm sorry for posting this here but i don't know what to do, i feel so purposeless and i want it to end. I've never spoken about these feelings with anyone. I don't know if there's a specific subreddit for venting so I'm sorry if this isn't the right place.

"My brother came to visit me from peru, this is the first time i saw him since i was 12 (17 now).

He would take me out to the movies, but me things for my birthday, and get me clothes for school.

it on a good note would be the best. iâm sort of torn because i donât want my brother to be sad about me. what can i do to make this guilt go away? am i just too selfish?",4,didnât have a father or a supportive mother he always took the role model of a dad. 
"A little background on me. I'm a 17 (soon to be 18) year old dude. What I meant by ""she makes me feel"" is that before her, all my feelings were very mild, sometimes even nonexistant. Like I didn't really fear anything (except for a weird fear of spiders, but that's besides the point), but I also don't think I've felt love or genuine happiness before. And I was fine with that, I liked being logical and that worked.

But this summer I met a girl. For anonymity purposes, we'll call her L. Now, L is the sweetest, most caring person I have ever met. We started talking at my summer job and instantly we clicked. Like our sense of humour is pretty much the same and she just feels so easy to talk to. If this isn't the place to post this then please poimt me im the right direction because I'd love some other perspectives on this problem since I'm completely incompetent.

Anyways, I've begun to notice that I feel genuine excitement whenever she texts me and I feel really happy while talking with her. But on the flipside, I feel like she's opened up all the shit feelings as well. I've never struggled with depression before, but I think I have it now. I've cried myself to sleep at 3 am more times than I'd like to admit and whenever I make her unhappy in any way I genuinely feel like killing myself.

So my question is this : Is it worth it? Are the good feelings worth the underlying crippling sadness that feels like it keeps slowly eating away at me? I understand that this might seem like teenage angst but I really don't know this, I've never had to deal with this kind of situation. So any responses and different perspectives are welcome, thank you for reading.

**TL:DR** Met a girl this summer who makes me feel amazing most of the time. The downside is that now I think I have some sort of depression and suicidal thoughts.",4,started talking at my summer job and instantly we clicked.

"Everything is falling or has fallen apart.  My dad killed himself several years ago because my mom left him for some douchebag with money.  My dog followed three months later.  I got an incurable STD from someone I trusted but shouldn't have.  Ive lost my license, and my car.  Im trapped in a dead end janitorial job that Ive been maxed out in for the last 3 years.  My spare income goes towards weed, so I can keep myself blithe and functional.  All I can do is go to work in a few hours and pretend everything is cool.  Nothing will ever change.  I'll always be poor.  I'll always be lonely, I'll always be depressed.  The woman I've been talking to is married, and on top of it, I think is close to dumping me for another side guy.  I could be imagining that.  Things have been different for several weeks.  Then since we've gotten closer to the New Year, she distanced herself more and more.  I think she's trying to get me to break up with her so she can move on guilt free.  I don't know.  We barely communicate.  It seems like she has better things to do.  

My intentions are to continue suffering through life, chain smoking, pounding sugar, and eating junk, until I get diabetes, heart disease, or cancer, and let it go untreated to kill me.  I have tremendous respect for people who have the balls to kill themselves.  Im not strong enough to be one of them.

I wonder if I'm even depressed or just too fucking lazy to do anything for myself..?

"So today in particular was a very bad day, I found out that my sister's husband beated my other sister who has been suffering from severe depression and he kept on calling her degrading terms (slut, bitch ) while my other sister is watching through the car, he also broke her phone, there were some 2 pieces of shit watching that didn't do anything, he also broke her expensive phone with all the data, I'm very angry and I think I might commit a murder I can't restrain myself. I also beated my father today because he said my sister deserves it

"I really want to connect with people. I really want to be understood, like normal people can understand each other. I really really really really want that.

Why does it have to be this way? No matter what I do I'll always be ""different"" and a ""weirdo"". FUCK THAT.

Fucking, what the fuck am I supposed to do, what am I supposed to do when the only way to connect with someone is to change, but change is impossible? I've felt like this ALL fucking month, but obviously I'm on a comedown right now, I think. Does butalbital have a comedown? I don't know.

Like, why does it have to be shit? I want to feel close to someone, I want someone to hold in my arms. I tried, I worked out, I cared about my appearance, I did everything right. Everything that I could-- and yet, I'm still stuck here just as alone as before. I'm stuck in my room, on a computer.

Is that too much to ask? Is that obsessive? Just to want someone to connect with, and hold? When, your whole life, you've been unable to connect with anyone. Even my own DAMN family, none of them ""get"" me. Why the fuck would a random stranger be able to get through to me? I'm fucking, hopelessly hopeful, that someone is going to come along and expose my soft side, that nobody knows I have.

I have a fucking heart, but I can't share it. There's no way to do that. I'm so depressed, now. It's not just the depression. It's everything. Everything I am, and everything I ever will be. Humans only have each other. But me, I'm not human. So I have nobody. I'm an alien, autistic, spaghetti-spilling retard doomed to never be understood or considered.

I want to just swallow all the rest of my barbs and finish a 6 pack. Fuck it, that's the only way I feel good, anymore. Drugs are the only way I feel good.

I'm too fuckin young for this shit. Why? Why me? I can't do this shit. People tell me ""you have time"". Time can't fix a broken robot.

I don't even know why I'm here. I have Asperger's. Nothing can fix me. Nothing can change me. I'm destined to be alone. I can't help myself, and nobody can help me. I want to be different, from the way I am, so baaadddd.. I want to be normal so badddd. It's so bad I just would rather die than live this disconnected.

"For the last few years I've ben hopping in and out of depression, but recently I have stopped caring about myself, I just want to make the people around me happy so that they don't end up the same way as me.

But I can't. Why? I always try to be as supportive and open as I can, never turn down invitations and try to hide what's inside me.

"The only thing that's really kept me alive is the realization that I am alive in order to make everyone around me better than what I am myself and to live for them instead of myself.

My life continued for others, never myself.

Yesterday my father explained to me how much I've affected people - in this moment I was faced with the truth I put off for more than 11 years. Being alive hurts people - financially, emotionally and physically.

The only reason I am alive has been conflicted - this is when I realized I was fucked.

So a little about myself and why I am posting here now. I have been lurking in this subreddit on and off since I found out it existed, about 6 months back. I've been dealing with a lot of dark thoughts and surprisingly don't even want to get better. I have no idea where all of these dark thoughts are coming from since I had a good childhood and was always a nice guy and good friends that I could count on. However, since I started university (2 years ago, in my final year now), I've distanced myself from my friends and to some extent my family. There was no apparent reason for it. This distancing however lead to me realising my own feelings more and more and to some extent ""find my inner self"". All my life I've dealt with my issues by helping others resolve their and I've always gotten by one way or another, with me abandoning most of my friends this has led to me not being able to help others. As a result of that I've had to deal with my own problems on my own and had to face them. Let's just say that did not go well. I am 6 months away from graduating and have zero idea of what I want to do with my life. I have my parents counting on me to figure this out and frankly that pressure keeps getting me into panic attacks every time I think about it and I start breathing faster, my heart beat goes up and I just want to start shouting. I know that this message is quite long but I've seen longer one's on here so I'm gonna stop while I still fall within the average and don't scare anyone off. I hope everyone is getting through their day alright.",4,abandoning most of my friends
"(just me writing down what may triggerd my depression) 







 I'm just not sure how my past experiences lead to me being Depressed. I know that I Was alienated by other people since middleschool and I newer really learned to interact with others. At that time I didn't really think my Situation is bad... Maybe that was because I didn't have much experience and I knew atleast how to physically defend my self.
Or is it,  that I don't evaluate it right and these experiences were a factor that played a roll.....
Maybe I'm forgeting something mmhhh.. 
It also be because of my view of the World.. 
Or my body just shitty....

"Long story short, I have long suspected that I have at least a mild form of depression. 

I function okay on the day-to-day and present ""normal"" and am not suicidal, but I go through waves where I become extremely upset (a.k.a. ball my eyes out about the state of my life every few months) and deep down I am pretty chronically unhappy with my life, although I try to avoid thinking about this very often because it just makes me sad. 

I come from a family of high achievers that doesn't believe in this kind of stuff (if i were to say I am depressed, they will just say you are lazy, in a funk, etc.) and I am broke/do not have health insurance (so therapy/meds out of the question). 

Is there an online test or something I can take to see if I have depression? Obviously I know it cannot take the place of a medical professional, but that isn't an option for me right now. 

Thanks for any help and I was so glad to discover this sub!",4,come from a family of high achievers that doesn't believe in this kind of stuff

"Hey guys, this might be pretty long but I have stuff I need to talk about. Oh, and I'm using a throwaway because a family member knows my main account name.

So, I've had depression for as long as I can remember, Originally, I though I was depressed because I was just lonely, so I spent a couple of years on a few dating sites where no one would talk to me because I'm not good looking enough. That made me feel even more worthless than I already did. Until my current girlfriend came along and started a long distance relationship with me. 

When she came into my life, I was in a particularly dark spot where I was having suicidal thoughts constantly and I even got out of bed at one point to grab my scissors and end it all. I eventually decided not to do it and went back to bed. The day after that last part, my girlfriend started talking to me, that was almost 2 years ago now and since she came into my life, I've gotten better and am much happier, generally, than I used to be.

A couple of months or so ago my suicidal thoughts were coming back and I told her about it (she knows everything above this) and then she started freaking out and getting depressed because she felt like she wasn't helping me at all. I reassured her that she was helping me and she didn't need to freak out or get depressed. A couple of days after that, the suicidal thoughts went away for a while.

Lately however, my depression's just really been getting to me and I'm just tired of living. I don't really want any advice, I just want to vent somewhere where I don't have to tell my girlfriend because I don't want her being depressed because of me again. Anyway, I'm getting off point here. Sorry about that.

Now, I did say I originally thought I was just depressed because I'm lonely. After being with my girlfriend, we eventually came to the conclusion that it's not really because I'm lonely, I honestly just don't have a reason for it. My life isn't bad, I'm in college and have an amazing girlfriend who wants to spend her life with me. I don't know, maybe I'm just broken or something. I think I should just end this here. I'm not actually going to kill myself or anything, but I am just so tired of being alive. I'm sorry if this isn't an appropriate place to post this, but I posted it here because it's something I don't want to tell anyone I know and I don't know where else to talk. I just want to feel like someone out there is listening.",4,vent somewhere where I don't have to tell my girlfriend because I don't want her being depressed because of me again
