"A good while ago back in college, there was a guy who joined our friends group. Me and him had a lot in common, and while a number of us found him to be annoying, I stuck up for the guy. I told him about my past - my first love was a long distance relationship and when i went to visit her, it turned out to be nothing more than a huge joke on her end and that gave me trust issues.

Time moves on, we end up becoming roommates with another mutual friend. Eventually, introduced into my life is this other girl.  She's a bit of a depressed wreck, and given my past, her being into me as much as she was, made me a bit hesitant to label the relationship.  We slept together a number of times, and eventually my friend found out, much to my dislike.  They got along a bit TOO well for my liking, to the point where i told him that if he ever slept with her, it would end our friendship.

A couple weeks ago, i saw her leave his room and our apartment ever so casually without making eye contact with me. Knowing immediately what was up, I questioned him about it.  I went into his room, saw the condom, and what really, REALLY hammered in the betrayal, the breach of trust wasn't anything they did.  It wasn't the fact that something was important to me that he knew about and selectively ignored. 

It was the lying.

He's been tossed out of the apartment since, but he is coming back once winter break is over. But in this process, i'm done.
Earlier, i was an apathetical cynical wreck who no one cared about, but now I can't bring myself to trust anyone, even the other roommate.  My friend was the more outgoing of us, so of course he has more friends, but I can't involve myself with any of them, much less anyone else because I can't...trust them.  In one fell swoop, it feels like he's taken everything from me. 

I don't care for my job anymore. It's means to an end, and that end is a pretty pathetic life. I'm at the point where i'm done with everything, because as far as i'm concerned, I don't see anything positive anymore.

"Hey Folks,

I feel that I really need a place to vent. This past September I was accepted into a program I've always dreamed of being in which was a great win for me. Unfortunately, it turned out to be bitter sweet because my grandmother passed away after a long battle with cancer shortly after starting. It really tore me up because I had to move away in August and didn't ever call her before she passed. I guess always felt I had something higher up on the list before calling her and might have been scared to call her too so just avoided it. The next time I saw her in person she was on a ventilator and heavily sedated, a shadow of her former self. 

The next months I kept busy with school which kept me from dealing with this event properly. Things just got worse from there though as one of my aunts was found dead in her house (heart attack) and another underwent surgery and ended up in the ICU. I feel I buried myself in school, shutting myself out from my emotions and told myself I would work through everything when I got home for Christmas break. The first day home, however, my mom got a call saying that the aunt who had surgery took a drastic turn for the worse and was on her death bed. This takes me up to now. This aunt who meant the world to me died and I just have lost all energy to function and have shut down. I'm scared to go back to school with all of this stuff still unresolved and I just want to feel appropriately for all of these losses. I've had a few complete breakdowns this last week but the grief hangs over me still. 

I think this is a first step to dealing with these issues but I'd really appreciate anyone else's perspectives. 

Thank you",4,"grandmother passed away, one aunt died due to heartattack, another due to surgary comlications, , had breakdowns, unresolved, grief hangs over"
"Backstory: I'm 21. My dad just turned 73. I have the typical father / daughter relationship every girl wishes to have. I was spoiled growing up. Yes, he's old. Yes, I was an accident. Yes, my parents are still together. Let's continue. 

Last year was big for me. Was promoted as the youngest employee company wide to have my position. I moved out. Travelled a LOT. Last year I also learned my dad's cancer had spread and it was a lot more serious this time. I was on my own, living my own life, for 6 months. I realized how bad things had gotten, and I broke my lease and moved back home to help assist my parents with things around the house. In May, he stopped treatment. He was given 6-9 months. We are now at the 9 month mark and he's on his way to a hospital bed in our living room. Meanwhile, my mom is a chainsmoker who is  coming down with pneumonia. 

Back to the point. My father is old, and has lived a very good life. I cannot be angry that his time has come. What I am angry about, however, is the fact I am now lost. Here comes my thought process.

Watching my mother take care of my dad in ways I would have never thought possible, how will she handle this when her husband is no longer on this earth?

He will without a doubt pass in my childhood home. When is the appropriate time to move out again? Will my mom be okay to take care of herself? 

I'm taking a lot of time off of work, and my boss is okay with it under the given circumstances. What if I'm not ready to return?

My mom lost her mother during the summer of 2015. Now she's losing her husband Spring of 2017, if he makes it that far. As far as family goes, it's just me and my brother, who has a family of his own. 

She's the type of mom who will spend hundreds of dollars on presents if it means not having to keep in touch daily / be a babysitter etc.. Not because she dislikes us, but because she has always been an independent, introverted.. er, bitch. When she does connect with you, it is something to be adored. She has a very unique way of showing love and it's the only love I have ever known from her. 

I keep having to remind myself that I am 21 and have my whole life ahead of me, but is that selfish? I'm not looking to abandon her after this is all said and done, but I ~feel~ like I need to return to my life as soon as possible. It's taking a toll on me mentally, and as a result, I'm isolating myself from friends and social gatherings. I just have no desire to do those things anymore. Some days its hard to get out of bed because I can't do anything. It's not that I don't WANT to get up start my day, I just lay there and think, ""whats the point? I don't need plans."" That's new. My parents are in the other room together 90% of the time, while I spend my entire day in my room trying to find things to distract me from my current life. I don't like thinking about the future because I feel exhausted trying to make those thoughts seem realistic. I'm either very irritable or so quiet that I don't think I can talk. The thought of going back to work to make money to resume the life I had seems unpalatable. 

I guess what I'm saying is, I'm stuck in a very large rut and I don't know what direction to go in, I just know that I need to get out of it.

TLDR: My dad is dying of natural causes, I put my life on pause to spend time with him, I realized that my mom might not do too well alone, and I don't know how / when / if I will go back to my life before I moved home or how I want to resume my life to move on.",4,"21 years old, parents very old, good job, promoted as youngets employee, travelled a lot , father diagnosed with cance, hospitalized, treatment stopped, 6-9 months given, worried about mother,mom a chain smoker, coing down with pneumonia, in a rut,"

I'm so tired of the suffering and I'm going to make it stop. the past few weeks i've done nothing but sit in my room distracting myself from these thought. can't do it anymore. just thought i'd get this off my chest. got everything all ready and prepared no notes no goodbyes nothing. everyone has turned their back on me so why the hell should i care anymore. was a waste of 25 years. brought nothing but pain misery and loneliness. anyway that's all i got",4,"gt nothing, family hates me, physically, mentally, tired of suffering"
"I've been going out with her for a little bit. She's told me she loves me a lot, but the past couple months i've made her feel unwanted. After she told me this and basically hinted that she wants this to be over, I realized that I have some deep rooted issues. I'm not happy (with myself), I haven't been happy for over a decade. I've faked it for so long, but I just hid all my unhappiness and now it's starting to come to me. I haven't wanted to wake up, I don't want to kill myself, but I don't care to live. Being alive just feels like my punishment for being a bad person. 

Here's this beautiful and great girl who loves me, and I've pushed her to the side and made her feel unwanted. Just so I can spend time by myself, alone, with my thoughts, because that should be how I feel. Alone and awful. And I hurt her in the process. She may be over me soon....but I won't be over her for a long time. And I need to let her go, I need to let her out of my toxic orbit. It hurts to know I've lost one of my best friends, but it's the only way I know how to get over someone. She deserves better than me anyway.

"This post is a mess. I don't care about structuring; I just typed in the words as they came to me... sorry for the mess...

---

I've been thinking about this for a while... then again, I stay in bed or sleep through most of the days, so I have a lot of time to think.

I talked to one of my friends (an increasingly rare species) last night and it got me to think.

I can't help anyone. As much as they keep saying things like how kind I am to them (""dude... if you really just said that, then you're not paying attention"") how good I am at listening, how much I helped (with what?)... nobody comes to me anymore when things happen. Unless I ask first, but by that time the damage is already done or they are already out of it.

So this friend and I talked and we talked for hours. Things got emotional at some points and eventually I just said ""Thank you for trusting me, but please, for your own sake, don't... you may come to me for help one day, on a day when I'm sick of being alive, and I will hurt you. I will makes things worse for you.""
Did I just say that? Really? Damn you, Bluerain12ya, what the hell are you doing?!?!

It hurt me. I'm on the verge of crying as I'm typing this and I don't know anymore what I'm supposed to do. Why am I even here? Why am I alive?

My mum recently told me about her depression which I knew nothing about. I didn't know how to react...
My crush was hospitalised due to a failed suicide attempt and despite how much we talked and helped each other in the past, she went to that other friend I talked to last night. I didn't even have the chance to help her. People who know about my depression, my medication, my self harm stopped talking to me. Sure we talk when I meet them, or if I message first, but for them to come to me first?
Hell, they are probably right. I'd just let them down anyway...

The only person I do talk on a semi-daily basis is someone I've met on r/selfharmpics
I have my doubts if I should message her any more, or rather if she should come to me and trust me with her problems. Every time I say something positive, every time I try to help, I feel like the biggest damn hypocrite on the planet. But I'm mostly worried that, especially recently, I just put my worthlessness for her to deal with, my constant whining, and I end up hurting her more than the suffering she already has to deal with. But I promised her, that I will not leave, I won't push her away and I won't let her push me away. That I might keep my distance if she needs it, but I will always be close enough to reach me. But I'm terrified that I'm just making things worse!!!

And I tried. I though if I try to help others, maybe I can take my mind off of things, and if they feel better, than I feel better, too. But I can't. And nobody wants to come to me. Nobody should come to me, anyway, since now I realise that I'll just be worthless... I'll just end up hurting them even more.

"It's been 6 months now. some days, she crosses my mind and I hate her with fiery rage and passion! Then some days, I don't think about her at all.....but then there are some days, where as much as I hate her...I still miss her like crazy.
today is one of those days. Today, I miss her, I fucking miss you!

I miss being able to end my night  with your voice. I miss the way my heart would light up when you spoke. I miss the way you burn with passion about the things you love. I miss you. I just miss all of you.

And now, the only thing I know how to do when I miss you is to numb myself with drugs and alcohol. I'm so numb, yet I still miss you.

"Does anyone else struggle around this time of year? I find myself fluctuating massively from being optimistic and determined to make positive changes, to feeling totally hopeless and unmotivated to do anything. 

I was dumped out of the blue in the beginning of November, and whilst it took it's toll on me at the time I felt like I could push through. By December I really was ok. But now the new year has come around and i've gone back to the usual routine of work, eat, sleep, repeat, I feel more lonely, useless and unlovable than ever before, convincing myself that 2017 is going to be awful. I wish there was a way I could just permanently stay in the positive moments where everything seems to have purpose and promise, but it seems as soon as I start feeling ok, I tumble backwards and feel worse than ever again :(

"She saw it in her mind's eye like a movie playing, the haunting memories from her childhood she couldn't seem to shake blending together into one raw, aching image. Her mother lying in a darkened room for days, her face swollen with tears. The inevitable ashtray overrun with ashes, the acrid scent of pot smoke in the air. The bed or couch or futon may have been different from year to year as Evie moved them around from apartment to commune to funky cottage, but her mother was always the same. Falling hard for some man, immersing herself in romantic fantasies that were crushed when the guy left. And the guy always left. Her mother's inability to get a grasp on reality had too often left Mischa to care for her younger sister, to care for her mother, from too young an age. She remembered shaking Evie awake, trying to get her to eat. To get up and take a shower, take her and Raine to school. No kid should have to do that. No kid should have to witness the way Evie had allowed herself to be ravaged by love. No woman should allow that to happen.",4,"saw it in her mind eye like a movie, mother unwell, lost grasp of reality, caring for younger sister, guys involved with romantically leave"
"I have beaten depression before! I really have! But this time for the life of me I can't! 

I have so much going on. Too much. A lot of heavy burdens but I also have lots of good too. My dad is living in the hospital. My mom had angina. My dad is a VERY COMPLICATED case. My mom's attitude is ""whatever"". And I have two older brothers, one who can't help through no fault of his own he has heart problems.

"Somebody I care very much for has been on escitalopram for years due to crippling depression.

His doctor said this was fine and last month he filled a prescription for the 20mg tablets which he's been taking since. Now, for the past week and a half, he's been feeling very emotional and out of control and the past 3 or 4 days he just can't stop crying, even at work. Every little thing upsets him to the point of tears and when he talks, he almost sounds like he's drunk. Of course, him being so emotional, he won't go to the doctor because he feels like it would be wasting the doctor's time.

"On Christmas night my boyfriend of two years broke up with me over text message. I didn't quite figure out what he was saying until the next morning.

We had gotten into an argument because he felt that I wasn't paying attention to him. I disagree. I was paying attention to him. Of course my six year old sister was going to act more excited to see him than a I do on an average day. He's a novelty to her. She thinks he's awesome. She loves when people just exist. She's six. And I made an error with the time that I went to his house, so we only got an hour and a half rather than the two hours I planned for. When we got to my house, he didn't make any effort to do Christmas dinner stuff with me or talk to me. And then he was mad at me for not spending that hour with him when he didn't try spending the hour with me. I tried. I tried to make everything fucking perfect. I was nervous. His family does Christmas differently. This was my chance to show him my traditions and we'd mix our traditions together in our future. I felt like we didn't get to be together much, so I invited him to help my sister try out her telescope. Apparently he didn't want to, but there was no communication. He didn't say anything. I sent my sister inside when we couldn't figure out how to use the telescope. He wouldn't come inside. He quiet-whisper-yelled ""no"" when I asked if he wanted to go inside. He told me that he never wanted to go outside. That I had been ignoring him all day/night. I don't remember everything that I said, but after he accusingly told me that my sister seemed more excited to see me then I have in a long time, I got angry. I told him that he could either come inside or stay outside. His choice.

When I came back outside after composing myself a bit, he was gone. The gift from my parents were sitting on the front steps and he was gone. I was terrified. I am terrified of people just leaving and disappearing without a trace. And he did just that. I texted him to ask where he was while trying to quell the rising panic. He could get hit by a car or get sick from the cold or just completely vanish forever. He replied that he was a good distance down the road. I panicked for a moment while formulating a plan. I went inside and grabbed my keys. I was going to tell my parents and grandparents that I'd be back, but they seemed so happy. I could totally handle this on my own while everything was falling apart.

I drove to the intersection and pulled into an empty parking lot nearby and got out. He was across the street and I wouldn't be able to safely cross right away, so I screamed his name. I'm not really the kind of person to scream, but I was angry and hurt and still panicking. I don't remember everything I said on the drive to his house. I did tell him that no matter how angry I was in previous arguments that I have never and would never just walk away like that. I told him that I wanted to in one, but I purposely left my purse and maybe my shoes so that I couldn't make a rash decision out of anger.

When we parted, he said, ""Over next few days, you should think about whether we should keep fighting for us or not,"" which I responded to with, ""Are you going to?"" I guess I heard it in a condescending way or something. He said of course. He said ""I still love you"" and I told him the same. Then he went into his house and I left and went home absolutely destroyed. I cried a tiny bit, but it wasn't hitting me. Then I got home and saw that my grandparents had just left and I was just devastated. When I came inside I cried into my stepmom's lap for like, ever. When I looked at my phone to say goodnight and send my love, I saw the following...

""I'm sorry the night had to end that way.""

""We're two totally different people and we don't seem to work well together. All we do is hurt each other anymore and it's getting to be draining. I need to get better and you need to get better and we spend too much time working against each other. I'm sorry. I tried. And you did, too. It's time to focus on ourselves.""

And that was sent at 9:15. I got home around 8 or 8:30. It felt like he had already decided early on. That wasn't the couple of days. It was barely an hour.

He then unfriended me and my family on Facebook. This was like, the 27th. We officially broke up on the 26th, I guess.

I don't know if I forgive him. I don't think that I do. I feel like he put the entire night being fucked up on me. Like I should have done better. And I usually tell myself that. I usually tell myself that I should have done this or that. But not this time.

I don't know how to move on or push through or whatever. I miss him and I still love him and I don't want him out of my life forever. I've never been so heartbroken. I feel empty and I am depressed. I've always gone to him. I trusted him. I'm telling myself that now he can go find someone who isn't stupid. Someone who isn't afraid of intimacy. I don't know, someone better. Maybe he wants to just forget about me with my fucked up brain and chemical imbalances and mood disorder like everyone else should. I don't know what to do and I'm really trying to just be happy but I can't. I barely got through New Year's Eve. I tried using positive images to get to sleep last night because I couldn't sleep, but all I could think of was love and how I was a fucking idiot to think that I'd ever find it. Why did I let myself feel?

For a very long time she's had her views on things and it was very hard to convince her otherwise but I'm scared that the depression this time is really getting to her and might shorten her life. This is the last thing I want. I love her to death I don't want to force her to accept any decision I make I just need help in trying to get her out of her depression. We've tried as a family to get her to go to the doctor but failed. She's always been creative and outgoing but since we talked about my decision, she's barley left the house, gained weight, and is in constant anger. I don't know what to do and to add to all of this I'm not there with her. I live away from my family and that's made it even harder. Any advice would be appreciated. Her cultural background is Arab if that helps at all.",4,"mother fallen into depression, who I  want to spend my life with hit her hard, love her to death , barely left house, gained weight in constant anger"
"
This summer I was very depressed after a break up and existential crisis. I ended up isolating myself in my room by not leaving often and my friend that stayed for the summer happens to be the one that loves belittling me, so they loved to see this. For some reason she is always so competitive and went out of her way to show that she had other friends and made fun of me for being in my room all the time. She was also the friend I was rooming with for the summer. I ended up failing my classes and taking the fall semester off because my depression became so bad. During the fall when I was at home I was fine, but now that im back at school all of the feelings came rushing back. I'm back at school by myself while my old friend group are probably getting together having fun somewhere. They didnt even contact me over the fall so i doubt that they care. I don't want to succumb to my depression again. I want to fit in somewhere this semester and do well. Any advice for this would be greatly appreciated.

"You promised to never leave me, literally a day before you left. You promised me you loved me no matter how much I bugged you and asked you over and over if you really did. You wanted to spend Christmas with me, yet a day later you left me. 

You promised you'd stay. You were mine and I was yours. You were always my one to talk to, my only one to talk to. The only one I could be myself around, the only one I've ever loved. For once in my life I didn't feel this horrible feeling I never wanted to come back.

I'm nothing but a distant bad memory to you, and the most you wanted from me in the end was pleasure. How fucking dare you. We haven't talked in 3 days, It's killing me inside. The most we have ever not talked in over a year.

As many letters or messages I write to you, to Reddit, or to even myself you will never want me. I will always want you, desperate for even just a message from you. I want you to miss me and love me again. It's all I will ever want.

You wanted me for so long, you fought for us, you wanted me. I'm guessing it's my fault. I wore you down, I'm so so sorry. I'm sorry to myself for making us end up like this. I love you so fucking much. You took money from me, oh well right? Too bad that money was worth more than I ever was. I will forever regret trusting you, maybe we would still be together.

I want the pain to stop. I want you to get out of my mind. I want you so badly and it's eating away at me. I will never get better. I never want another guy to love me or to care about me just to leave me like that. I never want to get hurt again like this.
I lost the only person who made me happy. I fucking hate myself, but I guess that's what you wanted. We both made mistakes but I am always the one to blame.

Please miss me.

I was broken before and now I'm shattered. 

I will never trust or love again. No one will ever get to make me feel this way again.

"For over a decade I've been suffering from this disease. Since middle school I've been telling my mother I need help and all she's ever done is dismiss me. Tell me I'm looking for attention or that I just need to snap out of it and be positive. It always made me doubt myself. To this day I question my sanity, is this real or am I just exaggerating?

It sure as hell feels real having been dumped two days ago. When my ex tells me I'll never be happy. When she tells me I make her miserable and I get in the way of my own potential happiness. She told me I ruined our relationship because I never did shit about myself and I'm a miserable asshole. She's right I guess.

I feel utterly worthless and alone.

In my senior year of high school I went through my worst and only other breakup. For almost a year she cheated on me and only told me after she felt guilty enough to do so. It completely destroyed my sense of self-worth and fucked my ability to trust anyone. That definitely had an affect on my relationship with my now recent ex. 

My dad left when I was 10. All I ever saw between him and my mother was constant fighting. That's all I ever knew growing up. My mom tells me I remind her so much of my dad. She seems to hate his guts. 

I have a great job and I'm making great money for someone my age. But because I'm not in school I'm doing nothing with my life. According to my ex I'm doing nothing to better myself because I'm content making the money that I am, I'm okay being financially comfortable instead of wanting to be filthy fucking rich. I have no debt at all and have a sizable savings and putting money towards a retirement. But I'm a lazy asshole because I'm not working towards something bigger. 

It's starting to affect my work life. I barely have a social life. I'm always down and no one wants to be around that. I try to be polite but I'm sure it comes across as disingenuous. I don't even know how to meet people or pretend to be happy enough to try. 

Please excuse my ranting.

The point is, I need to do something. I don't know what. I tried therapy before and it was awful. I can't bring myself to believe that the person sitting there with their notepad gives a fraction of a fuck about the chump feeling sorry for himself. They're just collecting a paycheck. I've always been determined to do things on my own but it's very clear I cannot. I'm doomed to a life of loneliness and emptiness. And I don't want to do this anymore. I can't.",4,"depressed, mother never paid attention, ex accuses of making her miserable, worst break up in senior year of high school, cheated on me, dad left at 10, worst feelings, lost"
"I am so lonely that its depressing me. I've been lonely for my whole life and I never really noticed it but around August of 2016 I got put in a team for a teamwork project I had for uni. There I met this girl and we started chatting. It was wonderful. We were basically inseparable. We were sending selfies and stuff and chatting all the time almost every day. We met irl(she lives in another town) and we both had loads of fun. 

This continued for some time and then something happened... She stopped chatting to me like we used to. She told me that she had some problems and stuff. We still chat but I really dont know how to describe it. Our conversations dont last as much as they used to and dont happen that often in general. I really got attached to her. And I really like her. But too shy to tell her how I really feel. 

She showed me what it feels like not be lonely and I really miss that feeling. I have almost no friends its only her and one childhood friend.

And now I am sitting alone at home. Everyday is the same thing. I sit at home in bed and sometimes go on my computer. And this repetitiveness of my life is really depressing me. I dont have a job yet. I will be at home for the rest of January.  I dont know how I can do anything productive when there is a massive hole in me. And some might say why dont I just go out and socialize. Well its not that easy for me. I am a very shy person and its tough for me to talk to somebody. I am just awkward. 

I just dont want a lonely boring life. 

I know that others have it worse. I wrote this just to share my story and hopefully feel better by doing so.

"So, my husband (25) was diagnosed with depression/anxiety and put on meds at age 11. He hardly knows life without depression. Aside from a few isolated episodes, it's been mostly under control. He's not suicidal or super moody, but he's not living life to the fullest either. He's just...there.

For the last few months, he's been unemployed, still trying to find a solid career. No degree past high school, hoping to get into bookkeeping (trying to take the learn by doing route). Luckily, we get by just fine on my income alone, but I still want him to find a career or something fulfilling to do outside of the home. 

I'd understand if there just weren't any jobs out there (but the job market is pretty good where we live), but we both know full well that he's not putting in sufficient effort to get a job in a timely manner. So at the very least I expect him to be helpful around the apartment, doing dishes, laundry, etc. Or at least try developing a routine so he can feel better (regular exercise, good diet, meditation, structure, etc.) But it's a struggle for him to even do that. He's just constantly drained.

I understand that this comes with the depression package. But I am still conflicted. I'm trying my best to be patient and non-judgmental. But I have a hard time telling if it's his own dang fault, or if it's depression that he can't help. I don't know whether to be angry or compassionate. Is there any way to tell the difference? I fear bringing this up with him too often for fear of making him feel even worse about himself.

Also, I understand that with the current state of depression medication, there is no cure, only things to make depression bearable. We're also apprehensive about changing meds too much since that can bring on a lot of emotional turmoil in the weeks it takes for the new medication to work. But how do you know or judge what is an acceptable level of functioning and what's unacceptable (and calls for a prescription change, therapy, etc)?

TLDR: At what point do you see a therapist/psychiatrist? How much depression (after meds and such) is acceptable? And how do I as his spouse strike a balance between pushing him to be better and being supportive?

"I am 16
I am a failure i am ugly as hell,i am being told i am fat so manny times,i have no talent,i cant even write (i can but almost no one understands),i am usually thinking about ending it with a gun but i dont even have the power to do it.I feel like I will never have a girlfriend just because of how stupid and ugly i am.I am pretty sure no one cares about me at all(my parents maybe).I dream about suicide almost every time.I just..im done
I hate myself 

My only hope is a miracle of me being perfect like everyone else and not a stupid fat guy when I grow up

Every girl i met and i try to start a relation with just says that i am fat and i ugly.i guess I could workout to get rid of my overweight (77Kg 1,80m)
But i can't get rid of my face

My grades are dropping really fast i had only 9-10 sometimes 8 but now...it makes me feel bad only thinking of them

I feel like a hug could help me(from someone who is not obligated to love me) like from a friend(boy or girl does not matter ) but everytime i try to hug a friend they say mostly ,,Ew"" (Girl) or something about my man boobs (Man)

An example would be for about 4 days ago.At the New year party were pretty much my friends,one was missing he was ill.I was all the time with a girl(also friend of mine)and she and me seem to like each other.I was having fun with her and just found out she chose the guy who was ill(my best friend since pre school).I never tough of me being with her ever since, but since that night i cant sleep anymore

"I was a loser's loser. I was 20 years old, never kissed a girl, weighed almost 270 pounds, got arrested twice, and almost flunked out of my major in school. 

The 2nd arrest was the last straw. I hit rock bottom and I was so embarrassed. In literally ONE SUMMER, I hit the gym every day, lost over 65 pounds and saw a therapist. When I got back to college, I got a 3.9 GPA the first semester back. I also figured out a way to be popular with the ladies, finally having a real sex life and I got a long-term girlfriend (today I've slept with about 15 women, a feat that previously seemed impossible). I was amazed by my hard work and success, I truly felt like I was on top of the world.

Unfortunately, the girl ended up ruining my life. She thoroughly mistreated me, and I took everything she threw at me because I was just so thankful for the attention. She got a job in a new city, and I decided to get a job there too so that we could begin our life together after college. Unfortunately, said girl went to Mexico on Spring Break and cheated on me before I ever even moved. But, I got a great job, and I decided to make a go of it.

Now, I'm almost 24 and since I made this move, the depression has been back with a vengeance. I can't shake this feeling of inadequacy because I let this girl walk all over me, and now because I moved for her, I still have to deal with this breakup even though it's about 1.5 years later. Something about the way I'm feeling comes out in my actions towards people. Everybody walks all over me, I feel so awkward in everything I do... I have not been effective at my job, which I'm sure comes from the lack of self-confidence.

The worst part is that I feel completely powerless, unlike how I felt before. Every day is such an uphill battle, trying to be normal and feel happy. I work so hard at my job, but I keep making mistakes that I should not be making. Therefore, I feel like I'm spinning my wheels, which hurts the confidence even more.

"Title. Just felt like punching shit while I was in the car on the way back, just wanted to lose control but I didn't. Felt like cutting, going back to the drugs I just got free from, felt like just going back to my old self, just wanna shut myself away. Why does this shit affect me so much. Guess it's just cause it should be easy yet I can't not fail at least once first. Same happened with my permit, I failed the first time and felt worse then than I do now. Guess it's the embarrassment, my family didn't think I would pass anyway, they said they did but I could tell. My friend told me it'd be fine cause it's **easy** so I'd do fine, so where does that leave me. Just makes me feel stupid. I can't retake it for like 3 fucking months either cause I'm going back to school soon. Hopefully this doesnt come up when I'm there, less I talk to people less chance it will happen right, that's just how it is with everything tho. It's fucking embarrassing cause everyone else has already been driving for like 4 years and I just started last year, lucky them, I didn't live here until last year. 
This just sounds more and more stupid the more I talk about it, which it is.

"Side story:
I am never been diagnosed. However, I always remembered back when I was a child that I had some happy moments, but really sad times too. Until I started school at the age of 6, I was always feeling sad and alone. I was bullied often. 
Three years ago, my mom tried to kill herself. She had undiagnosed depression and had been living with it for years. We got her help. We all blamed the depression on her mother that abused her as a child. She is now on antidepressants and is learning to cope with it. 

I'm now 30 years old. I moved to a middle eastern country for work. Been here for 3 years now. I am a huge mess. I have never felt so alone before. I don't have any will to do anything besides just work. I have no family here for support.  I do have 'friends', but they will not understand nor will they really bother to care.  I know that I need help, but in this country, I'm too scared to seek for help. I don't want to end up like my mom. I know I should be grateful for all I have and all the opportunity that life has given me. I should not be selfish, but I still feel dead inside. 
I wish I can move back home... but I will come back as a failure. I won't be able to get any respectable job. My parents would be disappointed in me. I don't want to tell them how I really feel because they will feel like it is their failure as parents that I am this way. They worry too much and I want them to believe that I am happy. 

What the hell am I even saying anymore? 

Point: I know I need help. I have no one to support me. I'm scared to admit to someone I know that I have a problem. I can't go home. I have to make this job a success. 

So i ask: What was the first step you took to get help?  
How did you overcome the fear of being stereotyped? 

Thank you...",4,"mom had undiagnosed depression, she tried to kill her self, feel alone , have friends who dont support me, cant move back home"
"I've been depressed for more than a year now, I am a teenager and self-diagnosed but I'm absolutely sure what I've been going through is depression. I confessed to my mother I was depressed once and she felt really awful, asking what she did wrong and it made me feel terribly guilty... so when she asked if I needed to be on medication and get professional help, I lied and said no so she wouldn't feel bad. Anyways, I've been going through these periods where I feel really good. Most of the time I'm content and sometimes I even feel happy. It lasts for a little while, last time for almost a month, and then I start slipping again. It's like a cycle, I'll feel good, then I'm depressed again and then, it gets really bad to where I'm seriously contemplating suicide. I don't want to die, I really don't, even when I say I do... but in those moments, it's serious. I hope you understand what I'm saying, I'm also extremely self-conscious, I've read this over a hundred times. Anyways, currently, I feel good again and I know soon that I'll probably return once again to a depressed state but, I feel really optimistic. This makes no sense, I'm sorry.


WHAT I'M REALLY WONDERING IS: I'm not sure if I should be concerned or not. I want to ask a professional but, I can't tell my mom... so, I came here to ask if anyone knows what this could mean.

"Hi. i need to post this. For the first time in my life i'm feeling lonely, i have always been extroverted and i have a lot of friends that i can call and hang out with but the last week i have been feeling lonely and depressed, manly because of a girl I like. 

I figured I needed to tell someone about it because iÂ¡m pretty shy and i don't want to tell any close friends of mine this. 

First of all, iÂ´m fat, and i feel bad about it I am trying to change it, I donÂ´t like it and i know how bad i look. I have never had a date before and i guess the main reason is because of the way i look, and because of that i haven't gathered the courage to ask anyone out. So, this girls just started working with me and i we started to talk to each other, many because we sit next to each other at the office, and because we both love reading and writing. I figured we had a lot in common so we started to talk about it. Last week I realized i like her a lot, i have never felt anything like it, but i'm really self conscious about the way i look and that if i tell her how i feel i will not know if i will be able to handle a rejection. I will still have to work with her and talk to her and i don't know if i will be able to do that. 

The holly day season didn't helped me either, this new year i spent it with my father at a restaurant and did absolutely nothing. I guess thats when i started to feel this way. 

I thought that telling anyone about this could help me understand why all of a sudden i'm feeling lonely and depressed and know what to do to change it.

"It seems like I was put into a family and city I don't belong in.  So of course I tried to move around to find the right place but since it was right after highschool , I never found a good enough job to sustain myself, so I came home and went back to school.

I've been back half a year, got straights As, and was pretty proud of myself.  The hardest part for me is that I can't find a job, even though ive tried.

Holidays are over, everyone's back to their own life , and I get hit with the backlash.  Saying I'm useless and lazy because I'm not a working and productive person in the world.  My dad basically told me I was a loser and if I'm not working by tomorrow I'm out of the place.  Being told your useless , a loser, losing your place to live, for something you are working for , is a horrible combination to hit someone struggling with anxiety and depression.

This time tomorrow Ill be homeless, and I don't have basically any friends from moving back, so I have no one I can turn to now but my own head is driving me into a downward spiral .

I have been doing good depression wise.  Doing the right things and the next best step, but now I have lost all motivation to even open my eyes. The past 2 days have been me waking and falling asleep crying knowing tomorrow I have nothing and no one, and contiplated ending it .

And then after that, you come out of the bathroom and pretend work is stressing you out and act cheery and happy over dinner that you don't even taste anymore because literally everything is just not good anymore.

"SO i think i'm depressed. Like i feel really shitty the time and i honestly want to die. I don't know if i want to do that to my friends and family, but there's a really great girl out there and i wasn't good enough for her. I just turned 16 and i don't think that now is the time for me to leave. I haven't lived a full life yet and that's something i want to do. 

It's all about love for me. I loved that girl so much, and she loved me too but i was too fucked up. I needed more than she could give me and it was too much and she's gone and I get this feeling when i see her in my chest and stomach because when i see her she's happy and i'm just sitting here wanting to die. We still talk and she still likes me, but it doesn't help. I was too much and not enough at the same time. We broke up almost a month ago but it feels useless to try. I don't think she even loved me, even though she may have liked me a lot. If i killed myself she'd be destroyed and that's really why I can't. 

I feel really unmotivated I can't do my homework and midterms are in a few weeks but I honestly don't care anymore. I think I'm going to do everything I can to live for a while. By that i mean live as in experiences. I want to smoke and drink a lot which I've started to do in the past week because it's one of the only things I can enjoy. I used to be able to wrestle which I think would have saved me but I got an injury about a week after my breakup. I have friends that will listen but they don't hear me. All they do is give me advice on things they know nothing about and I'm sick of it. They only do that because they don't want to feel guilty. I know I'm becoming more of a burden than a friend as recently and it kills me.

I haven't really known that depression was a real thing until 9 months ago when i became friends with this really cool girl that to be honest sometimes annoys me, but she's my friend and i love her. She cut, and I honestly didn't really get it. I get it now though, and I wish I could go back to my old naive self. All my friends are naive. I think a lot of them think I'm fine now because the breakup was a little while ago and I don't like to talk to them about how I'm feeling. They're all guys and they're the type of guys who just focus on either school or girls or drugs or video games. My girl friends are the ones that give me shitty advice. A lot of them are depressed too so they can't help me as much and I get that.

I just want to feel her in my arms again. I want to feel the rush of saying I love you and hearing her say it back. I know It won't be the same, even if we do get back together because it wont be because I love her it will be because I need her. 

She's the only thing that makes me happy right now. She knows that, and for some weird reason she still talks to me and she still likes me and misses me but i know i'm not good enough. I feel like because I need her to feel happy, It means I'm not whole. I guess i'm not, like i feel really empty but even more than the empty lost lonely things is the feeling that i'm not good enough. I guess that's why i want to kill myself because i dont think i'm good enough. All i do is start stupid drama because i can't just be happy by myself. I know it's all my fault; I needed too much i gave too much I couldn't be enough for her. I'm just not a full person. I need her for my own happiness and I can't function without her. I'm so co-dependant and i don't know how anyone puts up with me anymore. 

I know a lot of that didn't make much sense, But if anybody read all of that thank you.",4,"feel unmotivated, loved a gril, she loved back but Iscrewed things, she's gone, broke up, smoke and drinkgot into an injury after break up, depressed, alone , confused"
"I'm a people-pleaser. I like to fix, serve and help them, anyway possible  
  
That's kind of how our relationship started. I saw a complex, interesting girl hidden underneath all the darkness surrounding her and decided to help. It was not romantic until a month into knowing each other when I realized that I have just opened up to an almost stranger in a manner I never did.  
  
So, I knew it would be difficult from Day 1. There were so many things wrong with her behavior and I would spent days, weeks, months explaining some things. Sometimes it helped, sometimes it didn't, I never gave up on caring for her. The amount of times I heard from others (her family, friends, herself) about her getting so much better, that it was visible and how they believed in me helping her with day-to-day life. It made me feel that none of my sacrifices are going to waste.  
  
However, she went back to school, last year and she started to revert back to her old ways. I didn't say much at the beginning, hoping it would pass shortly, but it only got worse. She would be disrespectful, mean and cynical towards everything. Cold and cruel. You could say I was almost waiting for my turn, but instead I decided to not be too critical for the moment.  
  
It got worse. To the point where I believed I was going crazy accusing her of any bad behavior. I started to believe her saying ""it's all in your head and your imaginary worlds"". I couldn't take it anymore, the amount of hurt combined with both my heart and mind being broken, it started to affect my work, my lifestyle, my want to live like I used to. I told her about everything, criticized her behavior and in the end all I got was a ""Go fuck yourself. If I'm so terrible, leave me"".  
  
I broke mentally at that moment. I didn't know whether i was going insane or not, I even suggested going to a therapist for both my, her and the relationship's sake and to get some help because clearly I was being overwhelmed, but in the end she said she didn't feel like fixing my problems and that she wants to end things. She grew cold, distant and apathetic in a matter of days and continued to be like that for a month until we broke up.  
  
The breaking up itself... she refused to meet me in person, even after I said it was disrespectful. Again, I was told to fuck off via text and told to finally think about this relationship (like wasn't thinking about it and improving it 24/7 since Day 1...). I told her everything that I thought she could work on with her behavior and said my good-byes. Her last words were ""you finally thought all of it through"".  
  
Not longer three days after the break-up I found from her, now ex, old friend that she started dating another guy and has been hooking up with him for two weeks.  
  
After a few days, she had the audacity to ask me how I was doing. My first question was quite simple ""was any of that real or did you just need someone to help you get back on your feet?"". Her answer crushed the goddamn soul out of me: ""Don't mind it. I already forgot. Just forget it. But take my advice: don't jump into a new relationship instantly, you will be only pouring your old problems over"".  
  
I didn't even bother answering, didn't want to get cruel towards her, I told her friend about this and she cut contact with her in a matter of days saying that she couldn't believe the hypocrisy and that two-faced, disrespectful behavior.  
  
You might be asking yourselves: what's the moral?  
  
I didn't give up on loving people, I still want to help them as much as I can, started volunteering a few days ago. I think the moral is: no matter how shitty life or others treat you, no matter who they are, don't lose love for life and people. I was close to falling back to hate, way too close, probably closer than I ever was my entire life. Never had I had my heart shattered that badly, my psyche that confused, but I also met people with same or worse sicknesses than her and they would never act the way she used to.  
  
I know it's a bit of a stupid story, but I just wanted to emphasize that there are people who genuinely love you for who you are, even when you might not be well or great, even when you are not too nice to others. There will be people along the way, good people, ones that will make you not feel alone ever again.

"I do not consider myself as ever having had depression, but issues of conformity vs individuality, agnosticism/skepticism and romantic love vs. unconditional love for humanity have turned me to a dark place over this winter break and today during the first day of school. 

My relationship between me and my parents isn't close where we say we love each other, make physical contact, or talk a lot, and I fear it is my fault because of how difficult I was in the past possibly, and I also just don't feel love, give love, or subscribe to the idea of love much, only to helping people for the sake of helping people. I guess emotions really are a weak spot for me as an INTP. Many people upon meeting me have noted that I'm very cold and aloof. I was feeling angry at them recently for going against what I believed to be my personal and innate way of living, but now I am not sure. Today at school my teacher said ""how are you"" to me and this girl who had been bothering me for a long time, who I would get angry at but I had never talked to, who seemed to keep smiling at me and looking at me subtly as I would also look at her because I wanted to know what was going on, turned around slightly when she heard that and probably smiled. I still don't feel sure about her intentions but I think she was employing satirical techniques, which we just learned about in class today, and she is in my class, to try to prod me in the right direction, seeing how lonely and disconnected I was. (TO PUT ME OUT OF MY EGOTISM AND WEAK BUT DEEP TOXIC SENSE OF COMPETITIVENESS.) Today in psychology my class also started learning about motivation and emotion, and that was eerily attuned to my situation, because in the past few nights I didn't have motivation to do the work I needed to do, so I failed to do it. I also was going through a lot of different emotions. 


I keep getting sudden feelings that my life has just significantly changed, like today, and I feel like I am so stupid and I don't know how I was able to feel normal before, how I could be blind to it, but it is just so confusing. I find it kind of hard to look back on the past few months and remember what I was thinking. I see myself as just kind of having been a zombie in the past.

So I felt very stupid today, and I was going through my classes in an obviously different mood, which I now regret because I think I looked weird in front of one of my teachers. I kept seeing different ways how I had failed to accept love and integrate it into my life, and how I was nothing without it, how I was such a failure in so many ways. I was considering seeing a school therapist, and I talked to the few friends I had about the day's events, causing stress for them probably. I was skeptical of the idea of love for a long time though, as I wanted to study it in psychology before deciding what to do on that subject, and I kept feeling like I should only love certain people, and not really like or dislike other people but just want to help them when possible. I was always very individualistic and recently I had this silly thought Satan would visit me one night because I could relate to Lucifer. I didn't want to put my faith into anything, not some god or even unconditional love really. But we trust our intuitions all the time anyway, and I don't know what to do. It might just be a kind of unnecessary and bad thing to care so much about being skeptical of everything, and doing so could be egotistic. I have had the idea in recent times that maybe I could completely get rid of the ego and not care how I did compared to others, only focus on being the best I could be. And I don't think that was an idea I didn't accept, I think I accepted that idea.

I should note I had loving feelings for a teacher I have and I was scared to ever interact with her besides just being in the class, but this was something I was holding on to and I had feelings of wanting more of it. Not being able to love makes me feel guilty all the time, and I think I was labelling my problem as not being able to make friends and being lonely but really it was not being able to get and give love with friends and people. I couldn't make friends because I didn't have the right view of people.",4,"issues of conformity vs individualism, agnosticism vs skepticism turend me into a dark place, realtions with parents not close, no , not being able to love meakes me guiltyreal friends, deep toxic sense of competitiveness"
"Graduated from high school in '13 and everything went downhill. 
Lost a significant other of 2 years to a ""best friend"" who enjoyed sex with her, as well as a few other ""friends"" of hers. I was in ""love"" I guess but that spiraled into excessive drinking, partying, drugs, suicide attempts, and problems at home. 

I can't believe I'm still here today, but I lost a lot as things went down the pit. I had some true friends who I ended up abusing their kindness, and there's no chance of them coming back. On top of that, I made a fool of myself to my entire demographic in my hometown. It's a surprise I'm still here today, but at the same time I cannot help but to think of how much less pain I would be in if one of those attempts were successful. 

I'm not considering doing it right now, but I wonder when I'll burn the last of my rope. At this point there's nobody who can help me other than myself, but it's going to be a long and lonely road. 

Here's one for those who tried, and an apology to those who simply had enough. 
I love you all, but there's no reason to love me back.

"Earlier during dinner, my parents were discussing an acquaintance whose son was recently diagnosed with cancer and is currently undergoing treatment. Due to my (secret) lack of willingness to live, I said something to the effect of: ""If I was diagnosed with something horrible like that or even a terminal illness, I wouldn't do anything about it. I'd refuse treatment.""

Of course, like most good parents, they didn't like the idea of their son choosing to die in a situation like that, so we began arguing back and forth about it.

It got pretty heated. I was trying to express that everyone should be allowed to make that decision for themselves and have that decision be respected. I still stand by this, of course, but I've always done much better with written words than spoken ones, and so I wasn't able to express my point very clearly. My emotions easily get the best of me, and it's really hard for me *not* to argue, even if I simultaneously believe that arguing usually hurts more than it helps.

And then, despite the argument getting a little more than heated, my dad calmly said something to the effect of ""I understand why you'd make a decision like that, but as your dad, I'd try my hardest to change your mind anyway. I'd never just let you kill yourself. I'd do whatever I had to do to keep you around. I don't know what I'd do if you were dead.""

I got blindsided by that, and I was almost in tears. I could see it on his face. He was truly, deeply terrified of the idea of me not being around. He wants me to live and be happy. For the first time in a long time, I was able to differentiate selfishness from somebody actually caring about me.

After dinner I spent the next half-hour alone, crying in my bed. My parents have no idea about the depression and anxiety I've suffered from the past six or seven years and how I think about killing myself every day, and how much it meant to me to hear that someone actually cared about my well-being.

I've said some bad things about my parents behind their back, and I feel bad about that. Really bad. None of this is their fault, and I need to do better not to blame them for it.

Realistically, I'm not sure if this changes my situation much. It was a simple reminder that there *are* people who care about me, people that are going to be really hurt if I commit suicide. Up until now, this never mattered to me. I was entirely selfish about it. I can't explain it, but hearing and seeing the concern my parents had for my well-being just *made* it matter, I guess. Maybe I do have a heart after all.

For all the time I've been on this board, I don't think I've ever made a positive post, and I just really wanted to share this with somebody. I actually feel a little better, a little more stable after today's events. Thank you for reading.

EDIT: Thank you everybody for responding. I'm glad this resonated with all of you. I'm going to push myself to be more open with my parents from now on.

"I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a while just to see how other people deal with their depression in hopes that it could maybe help me but for the first time I feel a need to reach out to the community. 

I'm a 21 year old 5'6 asian male adopted into a white family living in the predominantly white New Hampshire, so I've always felt like a bit of an outsider. being adopted I've always felt more indebted to my parents than a real kind of love, so to tell them that I'm unhappy with my life seems like I would be a disappointment to them after all they've done for me. please don't be mistaken, I love them more than anyone else in the world but it's a conflicted and strange kind of love that's hard to describe and hard to understand even for me. 

Being in college I have friends who are mostly tall white guys who are either in relationships, or have sex with random girls fairly regularly. I have nothing against them, nor can I fault them for this however when I hear things like ""getting girls is easy"" or ""I can't believe you're never with a girl"" like it should be easy for me. I feel I'm a social guy, I go to parties, drink at the bars, and hang out with my friends every weekend, but at then end of the night I go home alone. It's not for a lack of trying, I try to dance with and talk to girls but being short and asian almost always leads to immediate disqualification in their eyes. I get a lot of ""I have a boyfriend"", ""you're not my type"", even ""I'm a lesbian"" i've heard it all. I'm constantly described as a nice guy, and I genuinely believe myself to be as such but the constant rejection night after night crushes me. It feels like I'm playing my life on extreme difficulty, and its constantly weighing on me.
(-as a side note I have dated a girl, and we did have sex a few times but it ended rather quickly and wasn't anything serious)

recently I got some real shit news, there was a problem with my transfer of major some 2 years ago. So I found out at the end of my second semester senior year that my transfer into the neuroscience program never went through and since then the required GPA has risen from a 3.0 to a 3.3. As a senior my current GPA sits at a 3.04 so it would be impossible for me to raise it to a 3.3 with the amount of credit hours I have left. As such my only option would be to settle for a psych degree, and I would have to take additional classes. I would not describe myself as a naturally smart person, so I have only survived as a neuroscience student through effort and hard work, something I have always forced myself to do. My entire life I have believed that if you work hard enough things will go your way, however now that I'm faced with this situation I have found out that all the hard work that I've put in for the past 8 years (since start of highschool) has been for nothing. I have all the required classes for a neuroscience degree but administration has told me theres nothing I can do so tough luck. So now the only thing that I have any real pride in has been taken from me and I don't know what to do. 

Depression has always been something that I've battled with for the reasons stated before, but it has never felt heavier or more destructive than it does now. one of the most memorable quotes that I have ever heard is ""Suicide doesn't make the pain go away, it just gives it to someone else"". This has always resonated with me, and has always kept those thoughts at bay, but lately they have become more and more real. I don't think I could ever do it purely based on how it would destroy my family but I'm wake up every day hating myself. 

Honestly thank you to anyone who listened, this is something I have never told anyone, but I needed to tell someone about this monster I'm fighting.

"I created a throwaway just to tell my story. Iâm not sure what else to do at this point. Iâm so upset I canât eat, canât sleep, canât do anything productive, and have nowhere to vent my frustration and no one to vent it to. 

Start with a little about me. Iâm a 38 year old female. Iâve been suffering from clinical depression and anxiety for many years now. Iâve tried treatment, but that only makes me more listless and tired, so Iâm really trying to self medicate with vitamins and exercise, but that doesnât always do the trick. My first thought every morning when I wake up is to put a bullet through my brain. Thankfully, I donât own a gun, and probably donât have the balls to do it, but nonetheless, that is my first thought every single morning. But every day I drag out of bed and continue to live, except for on my days off, in which I rarely make it out of bed, and if I do, itâs just to drink for awhile.

Now a little back story with what I am dealing with tonight. I fell in love at first sight about 25 years ago. Many things happened that made a relationship impossible, and we never acted on our feelings until about 8 years ago. At that time, he had a girlfriend. He left her for me, but due to sticky circumstances we never officially got together (aka living together, etc.) We did spend a really great few years spending almost every day together, travelling a lot and falling in love, or so I thought. Things came to a head after a while, it was a âforbiddenâ relationship from the start due to the aforementioned sticky circumstances. 

About 5 years ago, he met someone else and fell in love with her. She is a very possessive, controlling, manipulative type. Sheâs gotten his head so twisted up, there have been times he has wanted to commit suicide, and comes to me. He went almost a year in the relationship without telling me at all. Once I found out, he continued to break up with her (or her with him) every few months for a week or so and would spend it with me, just to go back to her and drop me like I was nothing. She is a horrible person. From the very beginning I tried to be cordial with her, because I never blame âthe other womanâ when a man cheats. But she treated me like âthe other womanâ from the start, even though we were together first.  As a matter of fact, her first words to me ever were to taunt me saying she âhas my man all the timeâ. At one point during one of his suicidal episodes, I sat right next to him as he texted her saying he wanted to kill himself, and her response to him was âDo itâ.

The last year or so, the break ups have waned, and we honestly have not seen or talked much at all. Our split broke my heart, and I was really just starting to get over it, starting to âlearn to live half a lifeâ like the song goes.  
Two months ago, he called me and asked me to take some time off over the holidays because she was going out of town and he wanted to spend a few days together. At first I was reluctant, because in the past we only ever did this when they were broken up. But I agreed because I just miss him so much, I canât even describe it. I knew I had to end it, but my plan was to spend a last few days in happiness with him then to tell him to let me go. Let things end on that note, give me some closure at least. 

So I took some time off. He called me a few weeks later to tell me he had the dates wrong, and I even went so far as to change my vacation time (even though my boss is not open at all to that sort of thing). I got new tires, got the car serviced so we could take a trip. Itâs really been the only thing keeping me going the last few weeks, knowing that I was going to be happy for a few days. 

Well, the time comes to take the trip. He calls me the night before, telling me he will call me when he wakes up and we can leave. The next morning, Iâm packed, just waiting for his call, could not even sleep the night before because I was so excited. 

That was yesterday morning. I still have not heard a word from him. I finally called his phone tonight and another man answered, saying he was him. Of course I recognized the voice and knew it wasnât him. The man asked me who I was and when I told him my name he said I have the wrong number and hung up. I have sent him a couple of messages with no reply.

So here I sit now wondering how I let myself fall for this, how I let myself go so far out of my way and get my hopes up so much just to be crushed. Again. I wonder if he did all this intentionally just to hurt me, or if something came up, maybe she came home early. I know I have no right to be upset because it was I who was planning on running away with another womanâs man, but I am still upset. Devastated. So let down I donât know what to do with myself.

I know whatever the outcome, a day from now I will be in the same situation I would have been anyways. I would have ended it for good, and still will, but I guess I had in my mind how that was going to go, and this is not what I had planned. 

I just need to know how to get this weight off my chest, this lump out of my throat, how to force myself to eat or even get out of bed (except to drink which makes it worse). I thought about using the rest of my vacation doing something productive, but I seriously cannot even. I just donât understand why he would do this to me. I never asked for this, he planned it all, just to let me down again. And for what? And I canât even yell at him, because he wonât speak to me. Half of me just wants to tell her everything just to get revenge, just to hurt him too. But I know that will only make me feel worse. 

I wonder what I ever did to be treated like this. I wonder how I can keep living. I was in a very bad mental state before this, and Iâm afraid this might just put me over the edge. I guess I just needed someone to hear my story. So here it is.

"I'm a lonely person but right now I don't have any friends or at least anyone I hang out with or talk to on a regular basis. I'm unemployed and living with my mom. So it feels like I couldn't hide those facts and I don't think any girl would be able to ignore all the red flags.

I didn't think i was capapble of love. But he liked me. He liked me for what I was. He didn't see this thin, blonde girl with scars. He saw something different.

But, he got back with his second ex who then abused him some more. She would cut if he wouldn't talk to her, laugh at his misfortunes. I was the one he went crying to every damn time. I was there when nobody else was.

They broke up, big suprise and he asked me out. I said yes and entered two happiest months of my life. Followed by the 4 most miserable months until he finally showed me mercy and dumped me.

He would constantly mock how skinny and pale I am. How my scars are easily noticeable, gee I never noticed. Laughed at my stories of abuse. But I loved him. I was stupid and I deserved to hurt. He would cut himself and encourage me to. I'm actually 7 months clean as of today but it's so hard not to go back.
