I wrote this tonight and I wonder how my husband or family would feel if they found it and it was too late. I wonder if they would wish they had cut me some slack, listened to me, or if they would just feel relieved that I'm gone. I wonder if they would realize that I wasn't a piece of sh*t, I was genuinely dying and it controlled my life. I feel like nobody is responding to or considering my cries for help. I'm alone.

Some days I just want to die;

There'd be no more days of standing by

Wondering why life is full of darkness.

Some days I just want to die,

This pain I can't hardly take...

And I'd rather plunge a stake through my heart

Than keep watching my world fall apart

Piece by crumbled piece.

The world is not my friend or yours,

It feels like nobody truly loves you

Until your lips turn blue and your skin is a lighter hue, your body burned or buried.

And how many more traumas can I carry on my shoulders

Before I stone myself to death with imaginary boulders

Because I feel like a soldier who has no more fight,

No will to live,

No pill to swallow to stop the impending hollow feeling inside?

How many more times can I die

Figuratively, but emotionally, too,

Before I can't handle any more abuse?

How many different ways can I say ""I'm dying"" before someone realizes I am not smiling?

Where can I go when people show their true intentions and I need a place to heal?

Can I come to you?

Together can we steal back our happiness?

Can we give each other something real, something normal, something lovely?

If the answer is no,

I hope you'll simply smother me

And put to rest my aches and pains.

Drain my body drop by drop

Please don't stop or call the cops...

Just do me a favor,

Erase the stains I leave behind

And find a way to smile and shine when I'm gone.

I love you unconditionally

I want to give you the best of me

Show you you're my soul

But I feel a gaping hole in my heart

A wound that stretches further apart every time I open my eyes

The size forever growing

Please, please, please

Please hear my cries

Please give me a chance to speak.

Don't mistake me for weak,

Just know I've fought for so long

And I'm trying so hard to be strong

But some days I just want to die.",5,Wondering why life is full of darkness

See I think hating or loathing someone takes this huge amount of energy. You have to be conscious about it. I think that's why it's not unusual for someone who really hates them self to also be pretty narcissistic. 
But for me, it's not a big effort. I don't hate myself, I just.. don't like myself. 
It's kind of like, when you have a group of friends, and there's one person in the group and you just don't get why anyone likes them. It's not mean-spirited, necessarily, you just don't find them interesting, or funny, or smart. They're not good-looking enough for you to think that that's why people still seem to like them. And you don't think about it all the time, maybe, but it bugs you. You find yourself rolling your eyes when they talk. When they're at events you're like ""seriously? who invited them?"" 
But when they're not around, you don't even think of them. They don't take up enough of your notice- they aren't remarkable enough- for you to devote any extra thought to. 
And I guess if I could sum that up in a word, that's how I feel about myself.
