"I look like a drug addict. I lost so much weight and I can't hold down much food without throwing up. I literally look anorexic. My eye bags are so bad too. They're so dark and deep. How can I stop these effects? My mom sees it and I don't want her to know I'm depressed. She told me I look horrible. I don't like to tell people I have depression either because knowing people they'll make me feel like my depression ""isn't that bad.""

"Iâm not relatively new to depression, as I have been suffering from it for nearly 3 years now. 

But there are a whole lot of different things at play that are contributing to my depression. My severe anxiety over work, relationships, friendships, and money.  And the worst is the intrusive thoughts. Not just about suicide, though. Other things as well and Iâm sad to say Iâve acted on these thoughts already. Not proud, but I canât fix it now. 

I donât really need any consoling or anything. Iâm not considering ending my life because I have no reason to. I am fully aware these thoughts are the depression and not my true thoughts. 

I donât need help as I can still maintain control. 
I just really really needed to get this off my back to someone, even if it is a bunch of random people. ",3,"severe anxiety,  intrusive thoughts."
"Every day I wake up sad. I try to appear happy to all of my roommates, it's getting harder to hide. It's been going on for 7 years, since I was 14. My family just thinks its something I can just not think about and it will go away. I find it impossible to tell my family in words how I truly feel everyday. It seems like they just see it as laziness, even though there's nothing I wouldn't do to feel 'normal' one day. Spending all my days on the break of crying, truly is miserable regardless if everyone thinks it's made up or an excuse for not being proactive(I've heard it all). Not really sure what I'm asking for in this post. It's just been a really hard this week, month, years.",3,"wake up sad,they just see it as laziness"
"So, I have really bad emetophobia. That means I have a fear of vomit. Â I have horrible dreams about vomit every night. Last night I had the worst vomit dream yet about my brother vomiting and it was so traumatic that it is really sticking with me today, I couldn't shake the horrible feelings. I found out after I woke up that he is actually sick and has been vomiting. But I have to go to an orchestra thing with him and my family tonight. I was obviously worried about it and my mom got upset about it and told me not to ruin the family's day. I really didn't know what to do because I had been on the edge of crying all day. I feel like my family thinks I am selfish forÂ  expressing my anxiety about this and I feel shame. At the concert it was fine and I was coping. But after the concert, my brother said he felt sick and thaf made me really anxious. I kept walking so I was away from him, preferably ahead. We went down a bunch of stairs and my anxiety grew. We went in an open area and I was so terrified that I would see him do the thing that I started to tear up. By the time we got outside I was crying silently to myself. The whole way to the car I was behind everybody so nobody knew I was crying harder and harder thinking about what I could do to avoid getting in a car with him, but thinking that my parents would get mad and think I'm ridiculous. When we got there we were about to get in an elevator and I was hyperventilating to the point that they looked. They went up the elevator and Mystica came with me while I almost collapsed on the stairwell. I literally was gasping so much I couldn't breathe. My mom came down the stairs and asked me if this was because I thought Michael would vom. I said yes. She said I need to pull my act together, that she doesn't want me to ruin their night,Â  she wanted it to be a happy night. She told me that he hasn't vomited yet so I shouldn't be like this. She said I need to pull it together. This was all in a raised voice and I could tell she was mad. 

This hurt me and invalidated me so, so much. I stared blankly the ride home and then I texted her pouring my heart out about how hurt I am. She still didn't really seem to care. 

I'm honestly a little bit surprised because I didn't think it was possible to feel so fucking isolated. I didn't think she would do something this bad. I left and slept at somebody else's house. I feel so horrible and worthless.

"I guess I'm looking for 3rd party opinions and maybe a little support if anyone else is in the same predicament. TMS has been the only thing to work for me, but its efficacy might be fleeting and insurance doesn't approve maintenance. I had a late response to the initial TMS series and they denied me for 10 more sessions; I wrote them a fairly scathing appeal letter and ended up winning; I used to be a writer at least in mind. I never had any accolades but I liked what I wrote and wrote a lot. So I let them have it in the letter and got the 10 extra sessions but everything is still uncertain long term.

So now my doctor drops the bomb that after this, ECT is pretty much where we go from here if the TMS doesn't hold. I'm 25, and I'm worried both about destroying my brain with treatment as well as allowing this disorder to keep me from really doing or acheiving anything in what will amount to a short, unnecessarily painful life. 

Is there another place people go from here? Do you just get real into Buddhism or stoicism or some shit and white-knuckle it? I always feel like there's something I have to be missing, and yet... 

I almost feel bad relating my story at this stage, as I'm pretty sure I'm doing all the things one is supposed to do, and yet recovery feels as remote as ever. Even with ECT it's like, what's the fucking point, probably fry my brain for a 60% chance at remission, that may not hold either. In fact, some of the studies I'm reading say that I may even be less likely to experience remission from ECT based on my absent response to medications as well as the length of my episode.

"I have improved my life significantly over the past two years: I found an antidepressant that works for me, I've gone back to school, I've got a steady job, I've even gone on a few dates, and I adopted a dog to give me a place to focus my attention and love on. 

I thought that if I could improve myself, or at least improve my situation, that it would feel better, and in some ways i guess it does.

The depression is still there though. It's not as constant ,and in fact as long as I'm around someone, my friends, my family, or even my dog, I feel alright. But it never really goes away. Sometimes I'm watching a movie, or listening to a song, or taking too long to go to sleep it hits me.

In these moments I remember that I'm a useless waste of life. All of my accomplishments are stripped away to reveal the fact that I'm just a bunch of nothing. In time it goes away but it's never too long before I revisit those feelings.

Is it the same for anyone else? Can you truly ever ""get over"" depression?",3," antidepressant that works for me, useless waste of life"
"tonight something strange happened. 

i was out with friends, we drank a little (i had about 3 drinks in 3-4 hrs) and when we left, we decided weâd go to the closest friendsâ house and continue to drink. i was by no means wasted.

out of no where my chest began to tighten and my heart started racing. at the last second, i asked to be dropped off at my parentsâ. i told my mom what happened and she suggested that it was an asthma attack. Iâve had asthma attacks, and this didnt feel like one (no wheezing/ out of breath)

it just feels like no matter how much i breath, i canât get enough air. and it also feels like my heart beat is extra loud? if that makes sense. also, itâs vey uncontrollable. there was no immediate stresser, but i have been stressed about life in general lately. like what iâm going to do in the future, a job, etc. 

the whole episode lasted half an hour or so.

i also get this feeling when laying in certain positions, being too hot, and feeling too constricted. none of these took place tonight, though. is this a panic or anxiety attack? does anyone else get this??

any help is appreciated :)

add on: the feeling is similar to as if someone were holding my heart and lungs in their hands, and slowly tightening their grip. not sure if that makes sense but itâs the best way i can think to describe it",3,"out of no where my chest began to tighten, heart started racing"
"He has depression. He told me that he lost someone important to him and he's been feeling emotionless since. This person apparently passed away without warning and it was within the last month.

We were somewhat dating and I noticed he pulled away, which I thought was him ghosting, but he said he was ready for a relationship with me before this happened. I'm not sure what to do now... or what to say to his messages explaining this.

Any advice? Should I offer to see him in person or do you think he doesn't want anything to do with me right now? As an fyi, I've never been to his house and don't know where he lives specifically so that's not an option. ",3," lost someone important, t been feeling emotionless since "

I am on medication, but yet all day long, I feel panic, trouble breathing and shaking all day for like no reason.  I can't identify any of the stressors, it just comes on and makes me really tense, irritable, etc.  I can't even really identify anything I'm scared of, I just feel like my body is having a biological reaction and is creating tension.

"Attention: I didnât expect this to be so long, but I guess I had to let myself go and just write how Iâm feeling, Iâm sorry if Iâm wasting your time... Itâs a mess, I know, (the paragraph organization) but anyways, enjoy what I wrote about how I feel, I guess...

Hi, again here, yeah... M18. So, yeah, I think Iâm going crazy... I ran out of my medicine about 5 days ago or so... Iâve been on it for a month. Felt really out of myself honestly... Wasnât sad, but I wasnât happy either. Something like a zombie? Did some research... Depersonalization... 

Oh well, I stopped taking it not because I wanted to, but because my psychiatrist doesnât give refills unless you go and see him personally so he can see you, understandable, except the fact that I have to pay $40 for each appointment? Plus the medicine... Yeah... I donât know about that... 

Anyways, Iâve been feeling weird... I donât know. Iâve been competitive all my life, and nothing has been working for me these past days. Used to play video games, Iâm pretty good at them, now I suck, and I do play regularly, I just canât play well. I like to do BMX... Iâm having troubles doing tricks I normally do... Iâm getting very frustrated and I honestly think of jumping out of my balcony... But, sadly, I canât kill myself... So, again, I donât know! Oh man...

 Iâve been smoking cannabis these past months, tried it once and, well, I donât really have friends, I mean, I consider them as friends but when your friends has depression, has been in a 72-hour watch, and other bunch of stuff, you should be worried right? Not them... Sad, sad, sad... (For me). But yeah, again, I donât think the cannabis is making me go crazy just because I smoke only before going to sleep and I just take about 5 hits from a one-hitter I have, which I would say is about, maybe like, 0.2g each time I hit it? Maybe even less actually, but yeah, thatâs the amount.

Oh man, this is getting really long, looks like a story haha... But yeah, Iâm bored, nothing seems to be fun anymore, I donât feel like doing anything, but I feel like Iâm wasting my time, which feels bad... 

Thatâs how I feel, I think... So, I donât know... I guess Iâll have to pay $40 to my psychiatrist to get my medicine again so I donât get suicidal thoughts again and I actually kill myself... Hope everyoneâs having a good day I guess?

Thanks for reading...",3,think the cannabis is making me go crazy

"I hate that you have no defense when someone disagrees with you. ""It's your depression talking."" No, shithead, maybe you're treating me like crap and I have a legitimate reason to be unhappy about that. Except you have to defend that because the immediate assumption is you being negative - and you're not even sure yourself. You practically help them gaslight you.

I hate that the only people who talk to you are miserable failures like yourself, talking about being miserable failures. What you need is a way out of hell, not more company there. And most functional people either don't know what the hell is like, or having left, can't go near it for fear of being dragged back. I know I wouldn't want to.

I hate that it fills you with so much energy and takes away any ability to release it.

I hate that your choices with most new people are to be a non-entity, or a drain on their energy because they have to deal with you.

I hate that for most of the medications I've tried anyway, it doesn't take away the sad, it merely allows you to function through it. Even if it does, it ultimately isn't enough if you don't have at least a bit of genuine happiness to hold on to.

I hate that you start to despise the coping mechanisms that you develop. You're in a world of swimmers and you aren't even treading water; you're drownproofing.

"My finals were coming up. I screwed them. I passed somwhow. I was depressed. I had a hard time explaining why I was like this to my family and friends. I wanted him. He didn't. I started cutting my arm and all, hoping he'd get sympathetic and stay with me. I didn't care what the reason was. Love or whatever. I just wanted. Him. 

Things happened. And we broke up. I was with another guy. I thought that would just be a rebound thing but right now, almost three and a half years later, we're still going strong. 
That chapter of my life was over. I was happier. But it took almost a year and a half to completely get over him. My ex. 

Down to reason 2 Now. 
2.  Moving away for college. I thought that's just the change that I needed in life but I was wrong. I hated it there in college. It was so lonely. I had Friends. But no one to actually hang out with. I was alone. Wanting to go back home where everything was familiar. But that wasn't possible. I tried taking with my mom and dad. But they wouldn't listen. So I asked stuck. I wasn't doing good in class. I was trying. I got better in classes. But mentally iy was hard. 

Then came pleurisy. A lung condition. And a sudden attack of asthma. Pericarditis. And some other minor things. 
Sick and alone. I started getting bitter. Negativity surrounded Me. Life seemed useless. There was nothing to look forward to.  Nothing to live for. I had friends and family and a significant other who loved me a lot and I loved him back. But none of that seemed important enough to live for. 
I tried taking to him. Explaining why I was acting the way I was but I guess after sometime he got fed up. He understood me but not too well.  

To him it was like me making negativity and sadness a hobby. But that wasn't the case. He tried. He really tried all that he could. But I was in too deep. He told me to force myself to be happy, think happy and be happy, but it's not so easy you know?

You'll only know how it is if you feel it yourself. 
I was stuck. I started cutting my arm and taking high doses of whatever Med I could find and sleeping pills. I wanted to sleep forever. To die. I started planning and plotting the best ways to die painlessly.  I was a wimp, a pussy. I wanted to die but I was too chicken to actually do it. 
I walked out In the middle of the night multiple times wandering around aimlessly trying to clear my mind, to make a decision. It was useless. I wanted to walk up in front of a car or a bus and get hit and die. I tried that. I got scared and never succeeded. 


Now a year later, when my medical conditions are fine and I finally thought I was over it all. I started feeling sad one again last night. Like life was meaningless.  Nothing to look forward too. 

I want to die
Again

I'm scared that everything will change in the future. Nothing will be the same. I'm not the kind of person that can look forward to the future. I want to cling on to the past I don't know why. 

I'm sad

I'm stupid and useless and overly emotional.

Eventually he asked me if I wanted to be friends with benefits. Stupidly, I agreed, fully knowing that I still had strong feelings for him and never wanted him to break up with me in the first place. A couple days later (yesterday), we planned to meet up. The time came and went, and eventually I figured out that he went on first date with someone and was starting a relationship. That really hurt, and now I'm a mess. The whole year, I've been struggling with severe depression and anxiety, and now I get to know that I was so close to to getting him back but he's with someone else now.

The whole ordeal made me realize again that love is shit, and without love, life is shit. I can't move on from my ex, and even if I could, there's nobody else for me to move to. Except the guy that I hooked up with, *who also happens to be friends with my ex.* I hit him up last night anyways, because I'm so depressed that I don't even care. 

Life in general is terrible too. Relationship woes aside, I have one good friend, and nobody else. My brain is addled with mental disorders (autism, ocd, anxiety, depression, possibly borderline personality disorder). My grades in school are terrible because I've missed weeks of it. I can hardly form meaningful connections with anyone, and even when I do, they just leave me more hurt than I was before.

It's all just terrible, and I don't think I can handle it much longer. I want to live, and succeed, and be in a happy relationship with someone that loves me. But I don't think I can. I'm too broken. All that's keeping me here is my one friend, my own fear of taking myself out, and an infinitely tiny and naive glimmer of hope that I might find my way out of this and back into someone's loving arms.",3,"break up with me, without love, life is shit ,Life in general is terrible, autism, ocd, anxiety, depression, possibly borderline personality disorder, hardly form meaningful connections with anyone, don't think I can handle it much longer"

I'm 18 and tired of this life, how can I get over all this bullshit?

"With the new year starting tomorrow and me being introverted. I'm confused on what do to tonight. 

I feel very alone around the holidays and try to make an effort to be with people because if I don't then I start a pattern of self-deprecation and self-hate and thoughts of suicide start to creep in.

My parents and brother are going to a friend's house (two of my former teachers) to ""have a good time of fellowship"" and blast fireworks at midnight. Totally sober. They want me there. I plan on drinking tonight and it would not be allowed for me to drink around my parents and their friends or my brother.

I have a friend that I went to high school with and we are good friends, like the type where we can go without talking or seeing each other for months but when we see each other we're still good friends. She kind of invited me over to her boyfriend's house for tonight. He works for a beer distribution center and has loads of beer. They smoke weed and have also told me about times when they've done cocaine. I want to spend time with my friend but I don't want to partake in smoking or snorting tonight. I think I have an addictive personality and cocaine might not be a good thing for me to try. Also i really don't want to get crossfaded. I'm not really sure if I should go to her boyfriend's house.

It seems like I only have a couple options, be stone sober with boring people and watch fireworks, be drunk with a friend and her boyfriend where coke might be available, or sit at home with my own stash of booze and bring in the new year alone.",3,"addictive personality, smoke weed, cocaine, very alone, self-deprecation,self-hate,thoughts of suicide"
"I used to be very close with my cousin and felt very protective of him. However, when we were teenagers we grew apart. My cousin is autistic but he always wanted to live independently. Anyway, he left his parents house and started working around the country (United States).

Unfortunately, he ended up living with a woman who had some sort of personality disorder. She was attracted to the fact that he was autistic and liked this vulnerability. When he eventually said that he wished to leave and move on, she tied him up and kept him as a prisoner basically. She would leave him long periods of the day (tied up so he couldn't escape) while she was out at work or shopping and then she used to come back and sexually assault him basically (he is essentially asexual so he didn't even know what was happening to him).

This would have continued for god knows how long until a neighbour found out what was happening and alerted the police.

She is now in prison and out of his life. However, he has been essentially sectioned for a while (because of the mental state he was in) and he is very upset by this as he has always resented his autism 'holding me back' and he wants to leave and start travelling across the United States again. This has lead to him becoming suicidal (which of course is not going to make the doctors want to release him).

I hate seeing him as a shadow of his former self but everytime I visit he asks me if I can help release him?

The problem is that he wants a lifestyle of travel and doing labour here and there. he is very hardworking that is no problem. However, his autism makes him vulnerable and he refuses to see this?

Anyone been in a similar situation?",3,autism makes him vulnerable becoming suicidal
"I saw this tumblr post going around the internet telling people to start the new year going to bed early and waking up refreshed, and I thought hell yes that sounds really nice, I should do that.

"Hey guys,

I'm hoping someone could shed some light on a situation for me.
I have been diagnosed with major depression disorder and an anxiety disorder. I have been suffering from.bith severe depression and severe anxiety for about 9 months and after trying numerous things to resolve it (including self medicating) I had finally decided to give medication a try.

At first I was put on citalopram, this caused many severe side effects like increased anxiety, insomnia, constantly sweating, nausea, dry mouth etc. But I had a period where for 2 days I had worsening of depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and very impulsive - like - uncontrollable anxiety (with constant shaking for 2 days straight). I visited my doctor as this frightened me and immediately switched my medication to effexor. 

I recall before that episode had happened I had binged on counterfeit oxy and counterfeit Xanax (two pills I have been self medicating with as it's the only thing that helps me feel ""good""). I of course didn't bring this up to my doctor and I am now wondering is it possible that the drugs used to self medicate might be causing alternative effects with the antidepressants?

The effexor seems to be a better fit for me as I didn't have many side effects but I still had a similar episode I had before. It all starts with a painful headache, then horrible thoughts and followed by uncontrollable anxiety that doesn't seem to die down. I remember I self medicated the second time in hopes it would stop the episode but that either didn't work or made it worse.

Does anyone have any insight on this they could share?",3,"self medicate,very impulsive, uncontrollable anxiety,suicidal thoughts"

"So, I want to share my thoughts about this year.

This year I failed nearly all of my classes, for the fifth time. I finally admitted that I am depressed. I also finally admitted that I have gender dysphoria. I started therapy, which is not going well so far. No improvements. I realized that no matter how much I analyze myself and my problems, I will never be able to solve them.

 I spent almost all of my days lying on my bed, doing absolutely nothing but staring to the ceiling. I gained weight. I am already overweight. I exercised less. I read almost nothing. I didnât even play video games.

I have no friends, I made no friends, and I finally lost my only friend. She wasnât reaiiy putting effort, I was making all the plans, and we met only twice, the whole year. I donât think she liked me, she just hung out with me because she didnât want to be rude.

As I said, I started therapy, and I realized that I have gender dysphoria. I have bigger problems. I have lots of bad personality traits. Lots of bad habits. Lots of stuff that HAS to be changed. I wasnât able to make any change.

I . I spent days thinking about it. How it is going to affect me. My days are precious. And I did nothing with them. I was so scared that I will lose them, I wasted them myself.

I lost all my desires, dreams and interests. I had some hobbies that would make me feel fulfilled, no matter how I felt. I stopped doing them. I realized that things are not going to get better. I should stop trying.

I started to hurt myself. I singed my fingertips. I whipped myself with a belt. I hit myself. I scratched myself. Because I am a bad person. I am unable to change how I feel, how my life goes, or how I think. I am powerless. I have no ability to make a difference.

I am not suicidal. There is only one âthingâ that can push me to it. I am prepared to do it painlessly. Unless this âthingâ happens, I am not going to do it. I just hope that I will be able to do it, when the time comes.

So, it got worse this year. Its going to get even worse, I can bet on it. I failed my family. I failed at my life. I failed myself. I totally screwed up. I am responsible for everthing I did, and mostly, everything I didnât do.",3,"have a bone marrow disease, shorten my life,  spleen got bigger because of it, failed nearly all of my classes for the fifth time, have gender dysphoria, overweight, exercised less, no friends, started to hurt myself,singed my fingertips, whipped myself with a belt,hit myself, scratched myself, failed my family, failed at my life, failed myself"

"I seriously don't know what is wrong with me.

The best way that I could describe it is 2 tracks are constantly playing in my head. One that is normal and happy. I have lots of friends. I have a good job lined up and am doing very well at university. This track sends out lots of positive emotions and appreciates life.

But for the last 2 years theres another track that CONSTANTLY talks about how every single thing is meaningless. A gorgeous sunset? Life is meaningless, there is no purpose to anything. Having a good time with friends? Life is meaningless. The best way that I ccould describe it is like a stone lodged in your shoe that you have no way to remove, and you have to go on a 50 mile hike.

Well I've had enough. There have been times when I have a respite and I feel normal. But they last a couple hours, a couple days at max.

I don't htink I have depression since I think a lot of positive things often, am not socially isolated or anything like that. In fact when I read the stories of people who are depressed or anxious I ENVY them. Because they seem to be upset about something concrete. Like they feel inadequate. They are scared what others will think of them. They are scared of things IN THE REAL WORLD. But whatever is bogging down is so frightening because there is no concrete root. I couldn't care less what people think of me. There's nothing in the real world that totally takes over my mind, because no matter WHAT i am thinking about, always what is playing in the back of my head is ""this is pointless, this is pointless, this is pointless...""

For me, 2017 has been the shittest year for a while. It can go fuck itself. 

So, for one night only. I'm going to get drunk and direct all of the vitriol and negativity I usually spend on myself, at an entire year. From January to December. It can all get fucked. All of the darkest thoughts I have about me and others. For tonight, they're all for you, 2017.

I hope you'll all join me in posting the nastiest things you can think of about yourself or anyone. And direct it at 2017. Tonight, it deserves it more than you. Normal self-loathing service can be resumed tomorrow. It's gonna get dark.

* 2017, I hope you die in a house fire.
* 2017, if you ever have kids. I hope they get abducted.
* 2017, I hope you get not-quite terminal cancer in all of your toilet-parts and then get hooked on painkillers and end up selling your arse for heroin money as your family and friends look on and laugh.
* 2017, I hope all of your loved ones die in a car crash.
* 2017, you're not worthy of kindness.
* 2017, you deserve nothing.
* 2017, I hope you get pregnant and both you and your baby die in labour.
* 2017, I hope your dog stops loving you.
* 2017, I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. In fact the only time I'd even consider giving you any fluids is if you were in a burns unit, burnt from head to toe. I'd have a wank on you. And that's only if I had AIDS.

Lastly, fuck you, 2017. In a few hours you'll be dead. And I'll still be here. Even though I don't really want to be. I still beat you. And that counts for at least ...something. Probably. Maybe.

"I am terrified.

I am terrified because something inside of me is broken. Even as I write this, I am overwhelmed, because it Is impossible to describe it. I do not know how to describe it. The closest thing to it is hell. It is a state when all of your worst fears come to life. When your paranoia is palpable in the air. 

It is the place, when you were a child, that you could never even conceive of. Perhaps when you had a momentary glimpse of it in your bad dreams at night, but then you woke up.  Now that you are older, you live in it.  Your life is literally a nightmare.

My mind has taken everything away from me. The bipolar disorder which came unto me in early adulthood destroyed my life. It took away all of my relationships and capacity to have relationships. It took away all of my hopes and dreams. It ruined my reputation and took away any career prospects.  The idea of being homeless, discarded, abandoned and left to rot is a very real thing that is facing me. There is no bottom. Even when you reach it, you just keep pushing yourself further down, wallowing in your own guilt. The only real support I have left are my parents, and I donât know for how much longer. I have caused them so much stress already. I have caused them to worry so much- how can one live with so many weights to bear on top of their original insanity?

I am in a place where everything Is dark. With feelings of inner death and hopelessness that make you want to crawl into a corner and cry.  The worst of it is the confusion. Knowing that you have tried everything, that nothing worked, and so you have no idea what you are even supposed to do anymore in life. Everything contradicts itself. Everything is a double-bind. Everything feels like a dead end, and every step forward feels like a step back.  So, youâre stuck. Worse still, you have no one to blame but yourself, so thatâs what you do, and thatâs of no use either.

So youâve become an expert in patience and endurance. You endure the shitstorm that is your reality. You grin and bear it, hoping it make it through another day.  You wonder how is it possible for a sentient being to be able to experience something so terrifying and painful. You also wonder what you did to deserve this- and if karma is real, then yeah, you deserve it.  There you are at it again- breaking yourself in, harder and harder.  Non-stop negativity, hostile and intrusive thoughts.  You donât want to be around others because it makes no sense. How could they be normal, have a sincere smile, and you are like this? It doesnât compute- it just hurts you more and makes you feel even more lonely.  So you live alone and isolated, and you wait it out. Minutes turn into hours, turn into days, turn into weeks, turn into months, turn into years.  Year after year goes by, and you experience some periods of normalcy or perhaps even joy, some success, but then as surely as the seasons alternate, your depression comes back stronger than ever as if on cue, and takes away any progress you have made.  It destroys any newfound hope you were able to cultivate and nurture.  It makes you once again cut off all ties, run away, and there you are again, once again cowering in your own little corner, your personal hell.

You hear all the naive New-Agers say âjust go for it!â, âcarpe diemâ, âyou only live once!â, âyou always have the choice to be happyâ ""you can always turn your life around""â¦ and you know, it just breaks my mind even more.  They donât understand, and you cannot make them understand, that this is not how it works, not for you. No, I am not some victimized snowflake, but there is something broken in my brain, in my soul. Some of the buttons, some of the options you have, for me, they are disabled. I do not have these same options, and no, it is not just because I believe that. I could live in delusion and convince myself otherwise, but it would change nothing.  Iâm just fucking doomed like this, you see?   Yes of course, that makes me the toxic negative person, as if I enjoyed it. Rest assured, I donât.  Oh and by the way, earlier on, I was able to turn my life around. I called on the help of some divine and holy miracle and relentless self-discipline and truly did turn my life around, but in the end, it never lasts. It always, without exception, gets taken away. Now, I am no longer able to call in the supernatural, the impossible. I can no longer will myself. 

Itâs something that we experience that most people donât. Perhaps they have had brief periods of hell, but not for as long as we do.  Every moment, I wish I were dead. I cannot kill myself for the typical reasons- it will hurt others and maybe, just maybe, there could be hope for something better one day, even though it may be inconceivable now.   

Personally, Iâm really looking forward to the day of my death. Why? So that when I have my life review, I can finally know WHY?  Why all this pain, why all this suffering, for what?  I can look my guardian angel in the eye without any regrets and tell him: âlook motherfucker, I did the best I could. I tried everything. There was absolutely nothing more I could do. Donât you fucking dare tell me I could have been more âopenâ, or âlovingâ. I tore my heart out to find my inner love, but there was noneâ.

So then by whatever process, I would be made to know, to understand why, and I hope to God that if reincarnation is real, that my next lifetime could be normal and joyous.   So far as I can see it, I do not feel that this kind of pain and suffering could be anything other than a) a punishment or b) a test of endurance. I can say with complete confidence that I have not learned or benefited in any way from my bipolar disorder. If anything, it has caused and continues to cause harm to myself and all those around me, and the worst of it is that there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.

"Maybe this will help someone or help me. Iâm not quite sure. Iâm a 24 m with three kids. Iâm going to back up and let everyone understand.

  When I was about 1 year old my father obtained full custody of me. I rarely seen my mother. Once in elementary school she came around once a month. My dad was always hauling me around. Pretty much raised me just fine as a single father. He got married when I was 12 and sheâs an alcoholic who is also a feminist. She was just that, a person married to my father. About 16 years old, towards the end I ended up getting a girl Iâd been in a relationship with for a year pregnant. I attempted suicide as all I have done in my life is alcohol and drugs. Very foolish and ignorant and didnât understand life. (I get it, selfish or whatever roast me later.) 
  We split because she had a very dark personality. She eventually got addicted to heroin. Which leads to my next venture at 18-20. I met a girl who was supposed to be a one night stand. Iâd have barely held a job and was completely irresponsible. We had shared parenting of my oldest son. I was also in school and decided I wanted to be a firefighter. I took my EMT class and got a job working on an ambulance. She accidentally got pregnant with me because of a failed nuvaring.She was very controlling of me and which I hated the feeling of being controlled. As I had been a free spirit for pretty my entire life. I was staying at home by myself since I was about 6 years old.
  I ended up cheating on her when he was about 8 months old.Ew ah, bad guy. Immaturity at its complete and utter finest.  Understood. But wait there is more! I woke up late for work which I shouldâve been there at 4 a.m after I got home at around midnight from college classes. I lost my job and ended up failing my paramedic class by about .5% which meant I couldnât go forward. So, I dropped out of college and lost my job. My parents let me move back in with them. I worked at papa johns just for a little money. Then came the first child support order. 
  Making barely 500$ every two weeks as a manager they decided to hit me as hard as they could with $200 a month. Not too bad but I couldnât afford to live on my own. *queue sappy music* I decided to get back into working on the ambulance. I was disgusted of not making enough to live on my own. I took out about 20k student loans as well to buy the ex and nice 4.5k explorer. As well made sure we had everything we needed. As well as a car for me! Debt debt debt. I made less money working on the ambulance coming in at a whopping 8.57$ an hour. I worked about 80-120 hours a week. Straight 24âs day after day. I found different girls to be with because I still couldnât afford to live because I only made around 1,200$ a month. We then found out my ex was addicted to heroin. We had shared parenting so the only way to remove the order without lawyer fees was to give my parents temporary custody.
  Alright, so at this point youâre probably like damn it canât get that bad. As Billie mays says, âbut wait thereâs more!!â Oh boy I reflect on life a bunch. I accrued 3 credit cards which are completely maxed. Heheheh. So on the with story, I met a few different girls and they all had decent jobs which let me have my own place to stay. (Crowd yells:gold digger!!) It was at this time I decided the current girl was not cutting what I needed. Boom, break up with her, at the same time I found a new ambulance job which gave me a 1.50ish raise. Heâll yeah. So at this point I donât have any custody of my 2 kids and my parents were so gracious to take a child support order on me. (Since Iâm making money, ya know 8.57$ an hour.) broke up with her and 3 weeks later she calls me to tell me sheâs pregnant.(oh god dude you havenât learned your lesson.) ((Iâm 23 at this time.)) 

  I said I have nothing with my first two kids and barely see them. I work for nothing and I think the best option would be abortion or adoption. Around the same time I got that new job guess what? Child support claimed I made 15$ an hour and raised my child support to all intensive purposes to about 485$. My other order was recalculated at 8.57$ less than two weeks later as well saying the first order was at 200$. So the girl hits me with the, literally, fuck you pay me.

  Thatâs nice. I said screw it major life change. I need it, something. I found my girlfriend through a friend on Xbox live, whatâre the freaking odds? I worked on an ambulance but they wouldâve taken half of every check which made the 15$ a day render pointless as Iâd only be making enough to go back and forth to work. Well, of course I get a massive 315$ order. Weâre up to 1100$ ish a month on barely above minimum wage. Now, did contracting work for my dad because I couldnât make any money no matter what to pay bills. Hey, arrears!! You said fuck your kids so weâre going to fuck you!! Oh.. is that what happened.. I found a blessing of a job making 18$ an hour. Not doing my career because I cannot afford it. Iâve been working overtime since 18. Practically killing myself to make ends meet. I am now forced to work on the road. I have to work overtime if I want to pay bills and eat food. Even then I still donât make enough. I havenât paid any debt off. Iâm about 28 grand in debt. Iâve had both my 2 kids taken from me. I didnât have a car for 6 months so I had to borrow my dads truck which he took back. My co-worker sold me a car for 500$. Good guy. 

  Now weâre here. Today, almost the start of a new year. Everything, anything, Iâve ever cared about has been taken from me. My kids. My career. My money. My life. My girlfriend gets mad at me because I can be insecure. What she doesnât see is Iâm holding on.. Iâm afraid to lose anything else.. not afraid.. Iâve lost motivation. Iâve found god. Iâve gained motivation. Spurts. Iâm strong. I have to be. At 24 I act like Iâm 45. Maybe 55 because Iâm tired. I work 40 hours of overtime 7 am-11pm of hard labor when there is work. Most of the time there is not. So average of 40 hours. If I get a second job Iâll get jumped by child support. Already happened. Seen a counselor to try getting prescribed adderall because my body is falling apart. My mind is blank. My thought process is almost gone. I can barely do the dishes correctly. My mother has taken herself away from me. My children have been taken away. He said Iâm strong not depressed. I canât even afford healthcare. I make too much as a âsingle guyâ to get Medicaid or the food card. I canât get legal aid. I owe tax money too because I claim 2 for 1 person. They are trying to take my tax return that doesnât exist either.

"**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**

I am so confused guys. So, basically my story  began 5 months ago, It was triggered by reading the news about Chester's bennington suicide. I am 20 years old male, with a previous history of OCD(Fear of getting a heroin addict.), but I can't tell if it is the same or worse. It is horrific. Here is what happens. After I read the news, in my head went something like 'If he can do it, then why shouldn't I?' And I started having intrusive suicidal thoughts, I will give an example:

-A friend: Lets go and drink a coffe tomorrow.

-Me: Okay

-My mind: If I don't suicide by then.

So basically at the begining (the first few hours) It was terrifying, but I was unaware what is going to happen after this.

So I got pretty paniced and googled: 'intrusive suicidal thoughts' and major depessive disorder or OCD showed up. I entered both web pages and both said '10 times higher chance of commiting suicide.'

This was the moment when everything fell appart.

This was the moment when I felt this rapid change in my mind.

This was the moment in which I felt like a part of me changed into something horrific.(Okay this was too much movie like sentence, but anyway.)

So basically my life is pretty rough since then I will try to be as accurate as possible, I have days in which I feel relatively normal. So, here are the things happening in my head and body. Some of them are constant, some of them are not.

Intrusive suicidal thoughts which feel real. I really hope they are intrusive, and not true Suicide Ideation. With a confusion If I want them or not. Which is terrifying.

Knot in the stomach.

Whenever I look online for something to buy, there is a feeling like 'There is no point I won't be here soon' and a knot in the stomach.

Feeling like I can't do anything fun, like can't relax I don't know how to describe it.

Less interest in people.

Less apetite.

Sudden feeling of tiredness sometimes.

Nearly constant, uneasiness.

Scary feeling, when I imagine my life without these thoughts, it feels like kind of boring?! I don't know it this is the right word.

Feeling on the edge, feeling like my life is shortened, like I will do something bad soon.

Random feeling of life being pointless without a reason with a variating duration.

Random TERRIFYING Intese feeling like trapped in life.

Random feeling that I need to escape, but there is no place to.

When I am feeling bad, there are constant thoughts, random things I have read on google reddit, with a pictures of the article I was reading.

I stopped working, and now I feel like If I work or feel overwhelmed I will do it.

I stopped University becausw of it, and because I didn't find it interesting.(I made a mistake with chosing my subject.

Intrusive unsettling feeling real scenarious in which my best friend tell me If I want to work with him.(We had a pretty sucessful store.

Feeling like I don't want to admit that I am suicidal?!

Feeling like I don't want to get better?!? I tried finding a reason, but I can't think a reason why, like I stop thinking when I try.

Fear that I developed these thoughts, a few days before Chester's thing, and I try to see my chats to see if there are some signs, but it is impossible to be sure.(This is not a big deal, but I am trying to be as accurate as possible.)

At first I thought this is depression, however I don't show many signs of depression. Then I thought it is Anxiety, but It feels darker and realer than Anxiety.

Weird negative feeling when babies arround.

Random feeling like everything I see is too much?

Fear/Feeling like this is something unknown, incurable and it is impossible to feel like before.

**Now on new year everyone is wishing ""many years"" and it triggers anxiety everytime like i don't want it?!? Guys I am really sad over this what the fuck.**

Intense moments when I feel like I am losing control. (I will give you an example of what it looks and feels like.) It happened 2-3 times for the last 5 months.

And the most important and horrific:Â  Scary intense moment with like a physical urge ######6. As it follows: It is triggered randomly. This is what happens: life feels meaningless with a weird image stuck in the back of my head feeling, like future idk, feeling of unrasiness, unsettled feeling, negative scenarious, I try to calm myself with a positive thoughts, I succeed for like a second, then it feels like the negative thoughts, reinforce themselfs and become more and more intense, then I am like 'If i feel like i will do something i will go to the hospital, chill., then like 'it doesn't matter you feel trapped' and it becomes even more intense and more intense uneasiness feeling, i close my eyes laying in my bed, almost starting to feel normal for a couple of seconds, then i open my eyes and everything in my head is intense again, i try again to counter them, it becomes even more intense.

I have several questions:

What does it look like?

Does it look like actual suicide ideation/suicidality?

Do I sound suicidal? I am so confused

Thanks in advance.

"Today I turned 40.  I'm supposed to have this life things pretty figured out, right?  not at all.

I'm alone, a recluse, a hermit.  I go out a few times every week to get groceries, but only at night when I have an easier time walking with less traffic and people inside the store.  That's the extent of my real human interaction. ""Hi, thanks, have a good day"".

I'm too frightened to make many changes to my life, even though I desperately need to.  Two years ago I tackled my drinking problem, that's solved and lost a bunch of weight. I figured i'd try and improve myself, do what I could first before asking for help.
I went crazy for a bit and threw out old stuff i'd been saving, like probably half of what I owned. My house has no furniture and everything is empty/barren, except for my one bedroom.

Now on antidepressants and seeing a psychiatrist.  I'm not sure how effective they are. I think they might help me focus a bit better on things i'd rather be focused on, but it's subtle.  I tried implying something more might be going on... or that I needed more help but my psychiatrist just seems fine with giving me SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics... just treating for depression/ocd... he doesn't seem interested in much beyond the norm and has never clearly come out and told me what my diagnosis was despite seeing him for like 6 months.

I've been unemployed for 2 years.
I have never driven a car.  I'll never have a family.
I'm not even sure i'll ever get another job. I don't feel like a person.

I struggle to do what's required for basic survival these days.
Lately i've been overeating and oversleeping.  I know it, I know how to prevent it by tracking calories and being mindful but like everything it's all so much work.

It's just difficult to see the point to any of this. My current plan of doing nothing is obviously not sustainable and not good for me... I just am unwilling to do anything about it.

If I get through another day without drinking, and manage to keep my house clean or did some other productive thing I try and say it's okay that I did good, but it's difficult cause I can say that however many times I want in my head and believe it but at the same time I still feel like I failed at life.  

I got no idea what to do.  Sell the house, move to the phillippines for a few years?  Just keep the status quo until they kick me out?  Get a job at Walmart or call center?  I dunno.  I got to do something different.  I wouldn't mind if someone just handed me a life in already good-working order and said ""here, trade up"".  I got no idea what a life that makes sense even looks like anymore.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is, I like just putting it down somewhere I guess and if people respond how they like that's okay too.

tldr; it's fine not to read it's just me babbling and mostly for myself anyhow.  maybe someone else can get something out of it.",3,"been unemployed for 2 years, drinking problem, never have a family, alone, a recluse, a hermit, too frightened to make many changes to my life, even though I desperately need to, went crazy for a bit and threw out old stuff"

"This is my little story. 

2017 was one of the hardest years of my life. I rang in the New Year drunk and drugged out at a music festival in hope that my feelings of depression and anxiety could be steered away. The whole year I fought an internal battle with my mind every day. I saw each day of my life pass by. I woke up many mornings hoping I could go back to sleep and not wake up for a long time. I had days of some clarity, but my illness just got worse. I tried everything to cure my mental illness such as becoming more religious, finding new hobbies, going out more but nothing worked. My mind would be temporarily occupied but I still came home each night to my bed of sorrow and hopelessness. My bad thoughts not only affected me, but one of the most important people in my life, my boyfriend. He tried to help me. He became my therapist which later in time broke him. I ran to him every time I needed reassurance and love. And he surpassed my expectations of an amazing human being. But instead of this causing me to get better, I only got worse. My mind switched this and I began to question why I wasnât happy. How could I have everything in the world? (A roof over my head, healthy family and friends, attending an amazing college, and dating this awesome human being). I simply could not understand how I could be depressed. I began questioning my relationship. Began doubting my life, my identity, my ideas, my thoughts, and my feelings for everything. The doubting got so bad that I just became empty. I felt nothing. And this completely terrified me. I had seen myself morph from a happy, determined and cheerful woman, to a terrified, guilty, depressed and confused little girl. I had no idea why my life was falling apart. I saw myself deteriorate as the days, weeks and months passed. My life was falling apart and I had absolutely no control nor will to fight. I decided to end my relationship of 3 and a half years. One of the hardest decisions I had to make. Before my illness, I knew I was going to marry this person. Our relationship was no near perfect, but we loved each other so much. But now, how could I be selfish and be with someone when I didnât have my life, my feelings, or my issues figured out. For once, I understood the stupid cliche of âitâs not you, itâs meâ. My biggest fear of hurting him, had became a reality. My entire life completely fell apart from having a stupid thought that I labeled bad. I over thought this idea I had and it morphed into a fear, a phobia and a obsession in my mind. I simply wanted to be perfect for my significant other but I wasnât. I have my first therapy session with my new therapist next week, January 5th. I have hope that this time, Iâm able to stick with it. I regret not continuing with my therapist when I first saw myself changing. I think, if only I had stayed in therapy, if only I had continued my medication, my illness would have not gotten so bad. I was a ticking time bomb and I just ignored myself. 

If youâve gotten this far of reading my dumb post, please, I beg you, if you are going through some mental health issues, please get medical help. Please. It was one of dumbest mistakes I have ever made in my life. Please, listen to your body and your mind. I always took my mental health for granted and now I wish I could go back every day to a day of normality where Iâm not struggling with my mind.

"I know a lot have been discussed about SSRI and their potential sexual side effects. For the last 6 months I have been on Fluoxetine and Duloxetine (my shrink thinks that my depression is a result of bad things that happened to me and was planning to wean and stop them within 1 year). However, I had to take a drug screen for work and I read that Fluoxetine can give a false positive result in the UDS and I didn't want to tell my potential employer that and take anti - depressants for the fear of stigmatizing. Anyway, I stopped both SSRIs 1 week before the test (now is 10 days without them) and I don't feel any different, in fact if anything, I feel happier, but the most striking was my marked increase in my libido and the capability to ejaculate once again :) When I was on the SSRIs I had turned into an asexual creature and if I ""force"" my self to have sex or watch porn I had a half - @ass erection and (kind of whiskey d!ck) and more often than not I had to fake and orgasm (using a condom) or if by any chance I can finish is after a long ""banging"" and with an almost painful spasms of my legs, really weird sense.

*-I am done with talks of suicide with my loved ones.*

I understand it is so stressful to have a partner or a daughter or friend who just shuts down every other night and says she wants to die. Even though I tell everyone I will not kill myself because I couldn't bear traumatizing anyone, I know telling them I want to die isn't helping me or them. It's time for me to put away suicide as my cry for help. If I really feel low I know the folks at /r/SuicideWatch are comforting and I frequent the sub to offer support as well. They get me. I will probably share with my will-be therapist as well instead of family and friends because they are not my therapists. Brings me to my next goal.

*-Stop treating family and friends as therapists.*

And by this I mean dumping my existential crises on everyone is not okay. They don't know how to help. I shouldn't expect them to help. I need real counseling from someone with experience and someone who can actually listen without getting burnt out from me. I know everyone needs a shoulder to cry on. But I am chronically depressed and anxious and I am always asking for far too much when I ask for shoulders to cry on. I am asking for shoulders to cry on for hours long. It's not good for anyone.

*-I will take care of my body.*

I notice differences in my mood when I eat unhealthy and my binge eating only worsens this. Regardless if depression makes me binge eat or if binge eating makes me depressed, I need to clean my diet up. I did a really good job of this last summer and I believe I can do it again. I can do this.

*-I will believe in myself.*

No more negative talk downs. I have to believe I can be better than who I was. I have to believe I can be better. I want to see myself as better. Maybe depression will never go away. But I have to learn to cope sustainably. I have to stop giving up at every mountain and wall and obstacle.

*-I will expect care from myself and only myself.*

No more dependence on others. I need to become more independent because I am very attached and attach easily.

Maybe a lot of this sounds like keeping things inside and bottling up. But I want to be as transparent as I can when it is appropriate instead of when it is inappropriate. I want to talk to a therapist exclusively about deep personal woes. I can tell a friend about a bad day sure. But my deep issues are really too spoken of too often these days and I know it needs to stop.

"Last year at this time, I was working in tech support being yelled at by people I don't know.  This year, I have a terminally ill family member and I'm struggling to find a place to live as I'm being kicked out of my old place.  This is compounded by the fact that the city I work in has no available apartments at the start of Jan/Feb.  The next closest city is about 100km away (an 1 hour+ drive).  

I've no idea what to do anymore.  Every day I wake up feeling sicker and sicker, my head is just full of clouds, I can't find my knife that I usually use to relieve the pressure (I suspect one of my friends stole it once they realized what it was for).  I'd ask for a hug, but I'm terrified of contact with people and it would just make me feel worse.  

It feels like there's a noise in my head that's just getting louder and louder, like someone turning up the volume on a TV station that's nothing but static.  People keep telling me how impressed they are by how smart I am, but I only look smart compared to those who don't actively reject everything that's supposed to make them feel like a person.  Academic medals mean nothing to someone who isn't human.

"Hi everyone. I just wanted to clear something up. Two months ago, my mild symptoms had started and progressively got worse. About a month ago, I was moderately depressed but a video triggered what I thought was euphoria in me. I have experienced moderate anxiety episodes before. At first, it didn't feel like it, I felt realllly good, but then I thought, ""I haven't felt like this, my heart is racing, this must be anxiety"" and then it changed to another anxiety episode. I think it lasted for an hour and a half. So, my question is, has anyone experienced this euphoria along with depression? I'm consulting a psychiatrist, but I feel guilty about calling her up all the time.",3,"video triggered, heart is racing, progressively got worse"

For the first time in over a decade I had a couple months where I didn't want to kill myself, and that fell apart as quickly as it started. I'm worse off than I've been in a long time, and attempted suicide 4 times in the past 3 months, ending up with two hospitalizations and being committed to behavioral center. The only thing that kept me from attempting tonight is a fear of failure, ending up back in a hospital, and the fact that I now live with my parents again. I guess the fact that at some point last year I didn't want to die made me hesitant to follow through with my promise, but honestly I hate that I didn't. It's just another thing that I couldn't hold myself to. I don't really know why I'm writing this, I wanted to tell someone but I don't have anyone to tell that will actually listen at this point.

It's been tough since November. TLDR: A friend of mine rapidly fell ill and has cancer - three tumors in his kidney which is the primary cancer and two tumors in his brain. Anyone who's familiar with stage 4 brain cancer knows how this ends. Best friend of 15 years cut off from me after I admitted to them I was diagnosed last week with Aspergers. Same friend has had my back through my mental health issues (bipolar, several anxiety disorders, anorexia, alcoholism) and somehow bails for autism?

I thought I couldn't feel lower until I was the one hearing about a NYE party I wasn't invited to by my other friend. Three friends and two are treating me like shit (or I'm over analysing, I don't know) and one's dying. I've been too sick with walking pneumonia to be able to see them in hospital.

I don't know what to do. I've been emotionally blunted/numb since August (physical inability to cry) as well as skills from years of CBT, DBT and CPT aren't really doing much. I feel like shit. I was the only one online on PSN tonight, the only one playing WoW and I can't focus on Netflix. I feel like a fucking loser and wonder why I'm always alone. It's not JUST because I'm sober, people still can hang out without drinking, but every year I'm alone. I was alone on Christmas. I was alone on Thanksgiving. I can't go out to Tim Hortons (my usual place to be to write and journal) because it's -37C and that's just not happening.

I don't know what the hell I want out of posting here, I've just found myself at this sub reddit more and more and I guess tonight I needed to get this off of my chest. Lord knows if I do it on FB someone will call the police again for a wellness check (despite knowing I 1) have a safety plan with my therapist I see weekly and 2) have been known IN THE PAST to get myself to the psych ER when I'm feeling low enough) or accuse me of drama or something else.

Everyone I've ever tried to meet online or in any of my games either turned out to be transphobic, homophobic and absolutely psychotic the second I refused their advances.

Forgive me if I sound extremely stupid but I've finally convinced myself after years of ignoring my depression to go see a doctor.

I know you are all probably thinking...""here comes some guy who just got dumped and he is feeling depressed so he comes here to bitch and complain.""  That is not the case.  I have had depression my whole entire life.  Im 28 and have been under serious treatment for about 4 years now.  

I have had my ups and downs, but mostly downs.  I was an alcohol and drug abuser but finally quit all of that to try and get better.  This was the first real relationship Ive ever had.  Even in HS and in college I never had someone just to call mine.  

Suicidal thoughts have swirled in my head for as long as I can remember.  At the height of my depression I began to self harm.  Nothing life threatening, but enough to draw blood and feel pain.  While this helped feelings subside a little bit...i always wished I had the balls to dig that razor in as deep as I could and just gashed up my arm.  But I am too much of a coward.

I want my life to be over...Im sick of hearing ""things are going to get better"" . ""try this new brand name medication that costs 500 bucks a bottle.""  ""youre a great guy just give it time""

I had been doing so well, I was a year and two months SH-clean. I was planning a tattoo to get that would cover all my old scars. 

but tonight brought on an depressive episode that Iâve never experienced before. on my way home, I was wailing/sobbing, talking out loud to myself about what was wrong with me, and then I had a thought that ceased the wailing and brought me to complete silence for the rest of the night.

"Hi there this is my first post. I'm on a throwaway just because people who know me know my reddit. I'd also like to say my family knows about this and I'm currently in CBT which has helped in some ways, but not in others. I'm also on an antidepressant.


I'm 28. My *entire* life I was always happy, laid back, protective, loved animals and especially dogs with all my soul, loved my spouse of 8 years and naturally looked past their flaws, never felt violent or unstable in the slightest. I was connected to everything I cared about. I spent a few years frustrated and depressed but I still felt love, kindness and interest.



6 months ago I had a total and complete mental breakdown. I experienced a violent thought followed by 10 minutes of visceral fear, confusion and fury. I was scared I'd hurt my dog. I didn't want my spouse to come home incase I hurt them. for 2 months I had the belief I was secretly some kind of murderer and was afraid to be around either of them alone. Since then I've retained a resentment and almost hatred toward my spouse and I feel insanely uncomfortable around dogs, and my dog specifically. I harbor this belief that I am evil and I spend all day either furious, repulsed or annoyed by my spouse. I also feel completely disconnected from everything I loved: music, hiking, landscapes, art, books, sci-fi and fantasy.. it all feels distant and alien and something I shouldn't be engaging in. I spent 4 months crying every day and now cry maybe twice a week, just because I'm so keenly aware this isn't who I am and I hate it. 



I was known for being almost too laid back before this. No problems with anxiety or anger. I am so confused and hurt and all day my chest is tight and my mind is racing trying to find answers. I almost have a fantasy of leaving my spouse and today I had a horrible thought of 'if they died I might be way better off'. I tried to brush it off as a silly escapism thought (as in CBT) but the very existence of it made me want to kill myself. I actually felt like I wanted it. 7 months ago I couldn't imagine a life without my family, now I feel like a prisoner to them, and they're so damn supportive, because my spouse knows this isn't me. I'm just scared it is now.


I've been told it's OCD, but I think a lot of it may be depression as well. I don't know what to do really. I mean I know I should wait and get better before making any decisions about anything, but I feel so angry and stressed and I'm starting to snap and be really snarky to my spouse. It's driving me insane.



Can anyone help with some advice, or similar situations, or anything? This is kind of just a cry for help of any kind whatsoever. I'm getting better at dealing with it but it still feels like a railroad spike in my chest and a demon in my head. I feel so bad and evil, and it feels like any good thing I do is forced because I feel like doing the opposite.

I have an issue reaching out to her. I don't like telling her everything going on. I don't want to trigger her. and, I swear, no matter how much I adore her I just can't bring myself to reach out. 

my absolute best friend ever is my mom. she is a huge reason I have struggles but I have forgiven her over the years and were extremely close. the thing is, she is flaky. as. fuck. she is there for me so often I feel terrible for being upset but she often won't answer texts... like times where im really struggling. and just recently she told me ""I can't fix everything""... it hit me that im asking too much of her. the thing is... she told me she would be there for me since she is well aware of my mental issues. we all discussed my possibility of ppd plus my mental disorders acting up. but then she says that... so I feel like I can't ask for help again...my husband just went back to work and I've been doing ok but yesterday was hard. against the wishes of my depression I reached out to her... she had a new outfit for church.. she said shed come spend some time with me after church before husband got home... she didn't answer my messages. when she did she said shed be at my house ""soon"". it took an hour and a half to get to me with a 10 minute drive. by then mybhusband was getting off work within ten minutes anyways. she just picked up my son, her grandson, and left pretty quickly.. I even told her I didn't want to be alone... 

im a burden. always have been. 

I have a great drug regimen for my mental disorders. Is been hospitalized and my meds got worked out perfectly. well since my first son withdrew from my meds in NICU when he was born I wasmt allowed to stay on them for this last pregnancy. Understandable... I have a lot of guilt for making my oldest sick... 

well my pregnancy psych seemed wary of giving me my meds when I asked, excitedly, if I could have them back after baby was born... she kind of gave a ""well see"" answer... even though im fully diagnosed and im obviously mentally ill and I've told them how well my medications work. my arms are covered in pretty bad scarring. they know I need my medications. im also not on anything scheduled. I refuse things like benzos and adderal because of addiction issues. 

well after talking to my doctor last take and her seeming iffy on giving me my medications I've just been feeling more depressed that I may have to wait months tobget them. I got emotional today because im scared and depressed and he got frustrated with me. 

hes my only other support person. im out of options. he tells me I can talk to him but he just gets angry or frustrated with me. hes a good person. hes a great husband. he just gets upset that he can't do anything... 

but he had just told me yesterday I could talk to him about when im feeling down. then I get snapped at... I feel like I have no one again. 

I want to cut. I won't.. but I want to. I want to hurt myself in some way. I won't. I just want to. I just don't want to hurt mentally anymore. I want to talk to my people... but theyre tired of me. I want so bad to reach out instead of withdraw.. but I guess my only option is to just keep it inside. im tired of feeling like an attention seeker when I keep telling people I feel alone or depressed. or that I keep saying im scared of going downhill. I feel like im begging people to help me and everyone is just tired... 

I just don't want to hurt anymore. ",3,"pregnancy psych, burden, always have been, want to cut"

" Hello everyone, 

For the past year and a half, I've struggled with an intense internal conflict. According to my psychologist, I may suffer from a mild to moderate depression. To this day I am prone to loneliness, sleeping problems, feelings of worthlessness, laziness and my intrusive thoughts from my OCD that would never shut up. Earlier this year it was worse, with thoughts of suicide constantly plaguing my mind (probably due to my obsessive thoughts). 

This time last year (Around the beginning of the New Year) I promised myself that I would seek help for what it was that was bothering me. This time last year, I felt hope that I would overcome this. Today though, I don't feel that way. Today, I feel like I am doomed to be alone for the rest of my life, that I am not going to amount to anything, that I will not connect with other human beings as intimiately and deeply as I want to. And that is when I am seeking help. 

The most prominent feeling I have felt throughout this year and a half old depression (it's possibly older than that) is loneliness. Sometimes it feels like an invisible brick wall cuts me off from everyone else, preventing me from forming true bonds with anyone. I feel like my family and friends do not care about my mental health; my family is aware of it but barely checks up on me. My brother (who is overseas) told me that he would check up on me and asked my sister to do so regularly as well. That was five months ago, and my brother has only checked on me a couple of times and my sister has not asked me how I am doing once. Also, my mum had to get a referall to continue my sessions with the psychologist. We got the referral about a month ago and she has yet to give it to the psychologist because she says 'she keeps forgetting' and that I should be the one to remind her. That hit me hard, because it made me feel like my mental health was not her top priority. My parents also say that I can come to them with any issue, but I know that isn't true, because when I do my dad always puts on a judgemental tone which makes me feel like dirt. Also, when my brother came to my parents for help, he ended up getting kicked out of the house. 

As for my 'friends', I question the validity of our friendships. Just today I tried to talk to one friend about how I felt today, and it flew right over his head, and he talked about what he was doing instead. That especially hurt me, because it made me feel that maybe no one in this world wants to hear my problems. With my other friends, I want to tell them so badly about what has happened to me (not one of them knows I have depression and OCD) but I find it so hard to bring up in casual conversation, and I think some of them might be to immature to take it seriosly. I also constantly think about what the basis of my friendships consist of, whether they are deep or superficial. I feel most of them are the latter, which makes me question if I truly even have any friends. 

I guess what brings me here are these questions: how do I cope with all this loneliness and anguish when I feel so alienated and estranged from everyone around me? How do I connect with anyone who I feel isn't willing to truly get to know me? Am I doomed to this depression and loneliness for the rest of my life? Will I never connect with anyone in an intimate way where I can express my inner emotions without fear of judgement, because I feel I cannot even do that with my family.",3,"intrusive thoughts from my OCD that would never shut up,feel like my family and friends do not care about my mental health, my family is aware of it but barely checks up on me,prone to loneliness, sleeping problems, feelings of worthlessness, laziness, "

"With severe anxiety and body dysmorphia it's extremely hard for me to connect socially, though being more social is something I wanted to do this year. Well, today my only prospect for being more social completely dissolved. A new friend of mine asked me some 10 days ago if I would like to attend dancing courses with her, and I thought that would be a great way to be more social. Then today she wrote me that she won't attend the dancing courses with me out of consideration for her boyfriend. 

Yes, be considerate of your boyfriend, who cares about ugly useless me. It's like Fate telling me: ""Don't even bother trying. You're too ugly to be with anyone else.

"Well today I went to work at 6 am, and from then until around 10 am I was in the worst mood I had in a long time; I felt like I wanted to die so badly just to stop all the problems I have. Several times I had to go to the bathroom just to silently cry my eyes out for 5-15 minutes.
So my mom and step dad pick me up and take me to lunch, things are okay, Iâm calm and...
They tell me that theyâve somehow been spying on when Iâm clocking in and out and they want me to clock out when they want to not when the managers want me to. Thatâs how they are-I canât do things my way cause Iâm an immature autistic 23 year old whoâs only staying with them because they offered me a place to stay while I build up money and looked for housing. Iâve been pressured to take a 2nd job in October because they hated how I donât get 40-60 hours a week at least; they donât want me going to therapy unless itâs immediately after a work day so my therapy doesnât conflict with their âvaluable timeâ, and I get praised for doing things their way but scolded for doing things my way. Nothing I do pleases them in the long run; in fact I donât even have the choice to go to the ER to get evaluated (because Iâve had suicidal like thoughts all day) or even quit one of my jobs.

"Early September to early December, for lack of a better description, was a never ending hell for me. Failed all my classes, withdrew from a lot of friends, neglected all my responsibilities, and abused drugs heavily.

In December, I had a stint of self harm, suicidal thoughts, and crazy self destructive behavior that really made me start to think about the bigger picture. I always dismissed my depression, because I thought I was a ""pussy"" for not even being able to feed myself or accomplish anything more than smoking pot, popping benzos and playing call of duty during the day.

But deep down, I knew I wasn't a ""pussy""/loser/failure. And neither are you. I know it's unbelievably hard/impossible to disconnect from that negativity when you're deep in the hole, so I won't tell you to push through it. Because that isn't how depression works, you can't just will yourself to get over it.

What you can do, however, is be honest with yourself. You have depression. It is not something you can shrug off or will away, and it's become a centerpiece of your thought process everyday. 

BUT, you can remember a certain point in your life where you felt happy/content in a natural way. Was it drinking a cup of coffee, and watching the sun rise? Walking around in the woods with headphones on? A good lift in the gym? Being in the company of a good friend? This won't come easy. I've found it helps to write these things down, because your depressed brain will make happy recall very, very hard. Definitely try it out a few times if it doesn't work at first, over the span of multiple days/weeks. This is a process, not a quick fix. 

Now compare those memories to your current day-to-day routine. Me personally, I realized that my college depression was eating me alive, because I didn't have a routine. In high school, I was forced to do the same thing every day. As much as I hated it, I was achieving SOMETHING 5 days of the week. Going to classes, having to get dressed, made a huge difference in my life. Once I moved out and had freedom to do anything, I ironically did NOTHING every day. And that's when I realized really what the root of my issue was. Without accomplishing something productive on a day to day basis, my reward centers slowly started to fade away.

So I forced myself to wake up at 7AM every day, and walk around in the morning for 5 minutes. It was so fucking hard. I completely failed to do it for about a month, then got lucky one day and woke up feeling okay. Managed to accomplish those two tasks. Whoa! That wasn't so bad. I also had to cut out drug use from my life, because pot, benzos, and amphetamines were making it impossible to wake up in the morning.

Granted, I am nowhere close to being out of the woods. If I were to slip into drug use and disregarding my routine every day, I would fall back exactly to where I started. BUT, once you start to feel better, and REALLY internalize the negative effects depression has on your well-being, you can start to be much more proactive about your recovery. I honestly believe the biggest mistake all of us make when we start to feel better, is to disconnect ourselves with how we felt while depressed. It's not something you can leave behind and go back to your old ways. 

Not exactly sure how helpful all of that was, but I hope someone finds it beneficial. 

And for those reading who are currently deep in the hole, just start to introspect. A lot. Write things down. Post on here. Be creative. Hell, even talk out loud if it helps. When depression really, really kicks you to the ground, it has to be the #1 focus in your life. 

And, of course, feel free to reach out to me if you all ever need anything. Everyone deserves to feel content, fulfilled, and happy. Yes, you. I know it doesn't seem like it, but life is worth living &lt;3

Happy new year everyone :) ",3,"abused drugs,withdrew ,loser, failure,"
"I have nobody to talk to. I find it hard to open to talk to people about things. Sometimes if someone asks me something, I can just see in their face that they are losing interest. People really don't give a shit what I have to say about anything. I can't talk to my family about anything because I haven't live near them for years and they don't hardly know anything about what is really going on in my life. Especially not with my depression. 

My SO has been pulling away from me and left me all alone last night because she didn't want to sit home with me and had already made plans with someone without me and didn't even mention anything until she was leaving. I sat home alone and drank myself sick until 3:45 when she finally came home. She didn't even say a word to me. Whenever I try to talk about things, it just ends up back in a circle and we have been in a weird rut for a long time. I have never felt so alone in my life and maybe not as low as this in a long time. I just needed to vent things. I am not looking forward to another year of shit like 2017.

"When I look at all the problems I have to face and all the issues I've got; my crippling anxiety issues, my huge insecurities about every part of me and my overwhelming jealousy leading to loneliness and isolation it all just seems impossible and pointless trying to fix it.

I cannot even think of a place to start with all this mess because every time I try and fix something I'm just reminded of how this other issue will still be there and it's like whenever I come up with a solution another problem arises. What's worse is how every time I do try and sort my life out and it fails, which is every time, I become even more disillusioned and deterred from trying again in the future, because it will just be pointless.

"Hey guys, long story short I've had a long history of depression/anxiety and I was prescribed Effexor towards the first half of the year (around April I think). Initially it lifted my mood, but very quickly it began to take a toll on me. I found that I felt completely disconnected from my actions, like I was a stranger inside my own body, and more worryingly I lost the ability to really feel any emotion. I've had to imitate behaviours and emotions even though I am not feeling them in order to still seem like I'm functioning. The only real feelings I've had as of late have been bouts of anger and a habit of splurging on stuff I don't need and overeating which I never really did before.

My doctors have been extremely unhelpful and I made the decision two months ago to slowly taper off my dosage. I was on 75mg a day, and I began by opening the cases of the pills (there are six small capsules within a plastic shell) and removing one of the capsules, over time ramping it up to only 3 capsules a day, the equivalent of 37.5mg. One day I decided enough was enough. I cannot be held prisoner with this fucking drug anymore, it's too much for me and I long to feel SOMETHING again beyond anger. I quit cold turkey 8 days ago and it's been rough, really rough.

I'm getting a TINY BIT of feeling again. Over Christmas I didn't really feel much at all, but I felt a bit happy the day after Christmas spending time with my family. My sex drive is beginning to return and my dick suddenly works again. 

As for the withdrawal effects, it's been rough as fuck.  I get ""brain zaps"" which is very common for people coming off Efexxor. It's like a sudden jolt in my consciousness and happens anywhere between 20-100 times in an hour. I can handle that though. I'm lethargic and it's hard to move my hands properly. I'm experiencing a lot of hot flushes and high temperature. I'm sweating balls when I sleep and during the day.

Worst of all is I'm getting bouts of extreme anger. Over time I've become a much more chilled person, but this anger I'm feeling does not feel like me at all. I'm convinced it's withdrawal effects. I get so mad I want to scream at full volume and smash everything around me. I've never consistently felt like this even in the past when I struggled with anger. The slightest thing infuriates me and I'm overreacting to everything.

My family have no idea how long I've been struggling. I made the decision a while ago not to bring it up because it only makes things worse. They made it very clear they want to help and share my issues but when I've spoken to them about how I feel in the past it has scared them and they have been over-protective. I choose not to rely on anybody else and I don't have anyone to share how I feel with so I felt like I wanted to make a post here.

I have become distant with all my friends and family. I felt such a disconnect with life in general at the start of the year that nothing really feels real anymore. I don't care about anything, I don't want to make an effort with anybody and I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about how I feel. I don't feel like anyone would understand. I feel like I'm not meant to be here and that I'm defective and people can just sense it when they're with me. Everything seems to superficial and pointless and nothing gives me joy anymore. I have vivid fantasies of pushing everyone I know away and living alone in solitude and never having to contact them again, starting life over. Even though I'm close to my family and have some very good friends, it never feels like enough and I've lost a lot of close friends recently by cutting them out of my life because they were toxic people.

I feel hazy, I'm sleeping bad and it's hard to focus, but I'm 8 days in and no matter how bad it gets I'm staying off these torturous drugs. Think long and hard if Effexor is really for you. It has become a prison for me and online research has shown me that it's the same for others. I am determined to beat the dependence, but I worry about how long I'm going to feel like this. I can handle a few months, but what if it never goes away? I feel incredibly alone in all of this. 

This is a bit of a trainwreck of a post but it feels a little better to put how I feel into some semi-cohesive manner. Has anyone else gone cold turkey and made it? How long did it take?",3,"prisoner with this fucking drug anymore,  bouts of extreme anger, family have no idea"

I felt good for a long time and one of the worst parts of this is knowing that at any time, for the rest of my life this can and will return. For no reason. And I worked so hard to wean off medications and itâs very discouraging to know itâs time again. 

I have a doctors apt at the end of January to ask to be put back on meds. Definitely not looking forward to the usual 6 week haze that follows. Iâm also in the medical field, and sadly there is a pretty big stigma associated with mental health. Itâs not respected and no one talks about it. Patients with it are taken less seriously.  I feel very alone. Iâm  estranged from my family for many years and moved across the country 3 years ago and have a very small circle (like 3 people.)

I guess I just needed to get it out. And continue to analyze how Iâm going to make it and function for the next 4 weeks (and then 6 weeks for full effect of meds) and Iâm just sick and literally tired of the beast called depression. I know it can get better, Iâm just tired of waiting.

"I hate the way i look. I always imagine myself as myself, but way better. I hate my breasts they look fkn huge (But they look average sometimes which is good) I hate my shitty stomach that sticks out too much, I hate my fat arms, I hate everything about my face but I specifically hate my face shape, nose, lips and forehead. My jawline used to be so nice and prominent before I got braces, but now it's ruined.

I'm sick of people commenting on my looks. Whenever i try to feel better about myself, someone rips me down. I hate the way i look. I want to get a breast reduction but I don't have money. I am going to the gym but I feel like nothing is happening because I don't feel pain the next morning no matter how much I work out. As for my face, my braces are coming off soon and my teeth are still getting fixed so there is some hope. But I don't look the way i want to. 

It's so unfair my parents have good features and faces, whereas I don't. I hate the way i look.  This is why I have very low self esteem and another reason why I'm depressed. 

I hated how I looked for a very long time. I'm 17 and I think i have body dysmorphia disorder. I fixate on everything and constantly look at the mirror at my flaws. It sucks.

"Hello,

Ive fallen into depression again a few months ago and it got really bad a month and a half-ish ago so i went back to therapy. I went to see the psychiatrist who prescribed me meds. Im on remergon as anti-depressant, akton for anxiety and Zopiclone Teva + ergytonyl for insomnia and nightmares. 

Ive started taking them two weeks ago. Now my question: does any of you have experience with taking those meds while smoking weed? I have not smoked any since i started my meds, but im thinking about maybe having a joint when i get home (im abroad for the holidays). Would that be a bad idea? I know that alcohol can interfere with the effect, dont know what weed will do tho and im way too anxious to just try it. 

Any opinions on the matter are welcome. Thanks! ",3,"smoking weed, taking those meds"

"I have Asperger's Syndrome...it makes understanding social cues, empathizing with others (IE understanding why you made someone upset), and social interaction in general very difficult. When compounded with existing depression, it makes me feel profoundly isolated sometimes.

Things have been looking up somewhat recently - I graduated college and am currently looking for a full-time job - but the fact that I will always struggle with this disorder and find it difficult to interact with others makes me profoundly sad. A relationship seems impossible, as does sex. I don't mind living by myself and have tried to come to peace with it, but being a round peg in a world of square holes does get to you sometimes.

"I'm jacob. I'm 16 years old and I live in Minnesota. I'm posting this because I believe I had an intense moment of clarity while I was stoned. (Not the good kinda stoned) I mean where it was just too much. 

    So my buddies came over to my house yesterday. I'm usually not depressed but just a little lost sometimes. Just every once in awhile I'll get depression that will last from a day to a week usually. And one of them brought some really potent weed. And we were gonna do it both days of new year ( New Year's Day New Year's Eve.) 

    So last night was New Year's Eve. And we were smoking it. One of them didn't,  it was just two of us and we were out in my old broken pickup truck freezing and smoking weed with a lighter with almost no fluid but it worked. A bottle and a 3/4in socket pressed into a water ballon filler as the bowl. It looked stupid but it worked. And we honestly had a fun time laughing about how stupid it seemed how other were inside and we're sitting in an old pickup truck smoking weed out a bottle. That night was fun, just sitting around chilling.

    So the next day was not as fun. We were smoking some now in the morning. We smoked like 2 full bowls with low tolerance. And we were so stoned we were freaking out. It was not fun and felt very depressing and lost. The buddy that brought it had a little more than me and he got sick from it. I didn't but it certainly felt like it. While I was sitting in the other living room coming down. It suddenly struck me that I'm a nobody. That all these things that I do are not what I want to do.

    It's about school is what my realization was about. It's a pretty small school so that's nice. But that's not what it's about. It's because I always talk about how I want to drop out and all about what shitty jobs I'll have to work. And I think if I drop out then I can just sit at home and play video games and live in those games in my head. But I realized sitting there that I was wrong this whole time. It's laziness that making me not do work and not give a fuck about school. I suddenly felt that I didn't want to drop out, how I wanted to do the school work. To not be shamed for what my opinion is about it. I feel that I have just already thrown my life away. I have all Fs in classes. And I feel I just need to do better because I haven't been trying one bit all school year so far. I feel I need to change it all then I think I would be happier. 

    I'm probably not making sense at this point my mind is still somewhat foggy cause I was like tripping for awhile from the weed. Btw I don't smoke that much just every once in awhile.

    But now I'm asking for your advice on what I should do and tips to do it. I feel like I can't but I know I have to try.

    I think if I finish school and graduate. I could do what I want then. Have a place to call home. Work a job and then when not working just have fun then like video games as an example I suppose. Just thinking about how I could have my own home and to love myself and not be ashamed that I'm throwing my life away.

    I wouldn't have to be throwing my life away if I don't throw it away. Please send some advice. Thanks

I know I have a very complicated form of depression and stress disorder, anxiety and at times from all this go through phsyical pains and small spells where I hallucinate things in the dark from the constant paranoia and overthinking of every detail.

Iâm homeless in a sense - I have no friend nor family; I live with my bf and his abusive family - they are toxic to me and just as toxic to him and so much do i want to leave but where would I go? Sometimes I wanna pack up and run as far as I can but I have no money. At one point midway in 2017 I jad two jobs and all was great till my bf convinced me to get a job at his call center company but policies changed and wages went so down we both axed it; I managed to convince him get back into a warehouse job I had gotten him back into 2016 that pays him very well but me? No job, too much debt, too much student loans so i cant go back to college nor have I been successful at jobs because I dont have much skills and well - Ive only been at two jobs long enough before my depression destroyed that.

"23F here. I have depression that comes in waves, and then recedes after maybe 6-9 months, with no warning and for no apparent reason. This has been going on since I was 18.

During these lows, I get suicidally depressed. I see the world through an incredibly negative filter until nothing seems to matter much at all. I often doubt that reality is even real sometimes, I feel so detached.

Since nothing matters and I kinda plan on maybe killing myself soon anyway, I tend to lose my inhibitions. I tend to feel so much pain that I can't expend energy pretending to be happy or living up to society's expectations. Nothing matters, and Devin's a prick, so I'm going to tell Devin he's a prick, consequences be damned! 

My depression is receding again and I am cringing at the things I did when life seemed to have no purpose. I am now having to pick up the pieces of what I destroyed in my depressive period- I'm a straight A student outside of these lows, but fail most classes during them. Next semester I plan to graduate with my Bachelor's, but I'm going to have to work hard to make up for lost time to even get above a 2.0.

Over the last few months I have cried in public, at work...I have snapped at people- depression tends to make me extremely mean. I always suspect people hate me and have bad intentions...my own grandmother, an angel on Earth, took me shopping, and I was totally pissy the entire time. This is partially because depression makes me feel physically horrible, exhausted and headache ridden constantly, but I still feel like an awful person.

While not depressed, I drink like a sane person. While depressed, I give up on moderation completely and drink as much as I want whenever I want. Tuesday at noon? Let's get blackout drunk! There is no God anyway!

Yeah, I showed up at Thanksgiving very visibly hammered, to dinner with my extended, religious family that doesn't drink. Before my depression started to melt, I just shrugged at how horrifyingly taboo this is. WHO CARES IF THEY'RE JUDGING ME? I'M BEYOND HOPE ANYWAY!!! HATE ME LIKE YOU ALREADY DO!!!

Yeah, my lows are VERY low.

Now I'm back to the outgoing, relatively high achieving, sane human being that I am half of the time and it's like waking up the morning after drinking realizing how horrible and embarrassing all of your actions the night before were.

"My brother in law 'has depression' and I say this because he hasn't been formally diagnosed. We live together and are quite close, but he never talks about his feelings. He went to the emergency department the other day for a panic attack and they gave him anti depressants and now he needs to see a doctor to find out what's wrong. Fair enough right, he most likely has depression/anxiety combo. 
Meanwhile he has splashed it all over facebook and messaged all of his friends. Told everyone he works with. And posted pictures of his anti depressants on facebook.
He will not stop talking about it but yet will not talk about his feelings thoughts or anything deeper than 'i went to the doctor for depression'. 
I get it if he doesn't wanna talk but everything he does makes me angry because here I am suffering in silence for the past 12 years. I finally opened up to his mum a few months ago (we're very close) about it and she's urged me to see a doctor and my boss holds me to seeing a doctor soon so I can get better and stop self harming. 
And then he turns around and pulls this shit. I finally felt like I was getting the support I needed to go and get help and he makes everything all about him. So I opened up to him about my self harm and how I've been struggling for a long long time, and he basically told me my cuts were nothing to worry about and I was clearly fine.

"Hi all fellow friends who are suffering from depression!
I have IBS, suffer from sleep paralysis almost every single night, be a paranoiac. To add to that, I had bone fractures which forced me to go through 2 painful surgeries over the span of 3 years (the first one to add a fixation device to my bone and the second one to remove it). The amount of antibiotics and painkillers I used only makes all the symptoms I have much worse. Sometimes I feel like I am the most unfortunate person in this world. And as a result, the fact that I have all these symptoms in my 20s when all my friends around me are super healthy makes me suffer from depression as well. Things have been hard for me for a few years. I don't want to go out and meet strangers and spend most of my time in my room.

However, a new year has come and I am determined to regain control over my life. I don't want to give in to these diseases that easily. I am too young and I have to support my family as well. I have maintained a habit doing exercises everyday for 2 weeks (running and hitting the gym). Now I want to start reading to understand more about all the aspects of mental health.

"Hi guys, I was just wondering whether any of you have been in this state of mind because. I can't find anything when I google it. 

I am a 21 year old male from the uk and have recently graduated and got a job out of uni. I'm from a comfortable family and my parents are still together and have been great all my life. I have a good group of friends who I see regularly, but all my life I've had a sort of apathy for living.

 I'm not sad and I'm even happy most of the time but I can't help feeling that life is fairly meaningless and it has always been really difficult for me to do anything. I don't really enjoy anything other than smoking weed and doing downers, such as Xanax, codeine and Valium. I'm addicted to weed and really struggle not to do harder drugs everyday too, but despite this I manage to hold my life together, even though I am high most of the time. For me, everything in life takes the same amount effort, from working to going out or seeing my friends, and so far I have managed to keep everything together by promising myself to do 2 constructive things a day although this has become really draining recently and I'd prefer to just lie in bed all day. 

Despite not really caring about anything I also get really irrational fits of anger and always ending up breaking stuff or ruining friendships and I don't know why. Last night I broke up with my girlfriend who knew about my weed use but not much else, although she knew I did other stuff. 

She was the thing I cared most about in life and she honestly made me care about life for a year, but for the last 6 months I've been slowly going back to not caring. I was just irrationally angry and I broke up with her for no reason and even while I was doing it I couldn't stop myself and I've fucked up the best thing in my life. I really struggle communicating my feelings with her and so I just blow up and blow things out of proportion. 

Without her I don't care about anything and I just can't be bothered to go on living everyday feeling dead inside and occasionally very angry. But I can't be with herb because I screw it up every time. 

I don't want to die because my parents would be devastated and I care about them and my sister. But I do want to be dead because I can't be bothered to do life anymore, so I was wondering whether anyone else feels like this and if you have any tips as to how to keep going with it all?

I didn't know it was an antidepressant and when I forgot to take it on a trip, I had a complete emotional break down. Safe to say I STOPPED taking it. Now my depression comes and gos.

I also have a stupid past of abusing ""rave drugs.""  I have abused MDMA/molly a few times in the last 2 years. I really was uneducated at the time this could be very bad for someone with my issues and I feel like this past made my depression much worse/an actual problem. Trust me, not doing these things again. (I was very sheltered as a child so moving out was a huge learning experience)

I currently am living a healthy lifestyle. I eat pretty good and workout almost everyday but I just have been feeling HORRIBLE lately..

Extremely depressed. Nothing I used to do for fun is fun anymore. I feel this weight on my chest almost all day/everyday. I feel like all my social interactions are forced. I don't genuinely care what anyone is saying nor care to respond. And when I do to ""seem normal"" nothing comes out right or I just seem so fake.

My anxiety has been very bad. I have very negative thoughts, constantly think about my finance leaving me or people I love dying. Thinking I'm so disgusting. Literally no confidence at all. Going ""blank"" in social situations. Just not feeling human very dissociative. I run my own business and have panic attacks all the time (usually business related things cause this) or arguing.

This unmangiable feeling has been going on for a month now. Alcohol doesn't even seem to help anymore. And this sucks because I am actually very fun, intelligent and funny. I used to be the life of the party (with the help of alcohol or being comfortable with the people I was with) and now I literally can't even force myself to pretend I'm fun.

I hate living this way and really don't want to be on antidepressants.. I want to try something more natural because natural things have worked before. 

Can someone recommend something to me? I've been reading about nootropics the past 2 days and am very interested. 

Thank you!!",3," have a stupid past of abusing """"rave drugs, only thing that ever USED to help, and still does time to time was alcohol"
"This is my first time on this subreddit, so I apologize in advance if my post doesnât meet the rules. Iâve just been wanting to get everything off my chest for so long and this is the first place it seems like I can do that. 

A month ago I started seeing a LCSW because an HR lady at work recommended I take advantage of the EAP program after I spent an hour and a half bawling my eyes out in her office. I was there because I knew I was going to have to go back to the hospital and I didnât want to. I thought I could work from the hospital because I canât leave work for that long. Iâll just get that much further behind. 

That hospital at the tail end of December was my 4th stay for the year, 3rd for a crisis. I have Myasthenia Gravis, a neuromuscular autoimmune disorder that causes weakness in my voluntary muscles. I was diagnosed at 18. I grieved. I pulled my boots on and I kept going.

Except I donât want to keep going anymore. Iâm not suicidal, but the thought of having to take medicine in 3 hours and 20 minutes so I can stay ahead of the weakness makes me tired. Iâm so tired. I live my life in 4 hour increments between pills. 

Iâm 23 now. In the almost 5 years since Iâve been diagnosed, Iâve had 5 crisis events that Iâve had to be hospitalized for. 3 of those included a feeding tube. 1 of those included the flu and ICU. 

Normally I can push through and get back to routine. This time I canât. I want to cry. I am crying as I type this. I donât know whatâs different about this time. 

My counselor (social worker? Therapist? Whatâs the appropriate term?) says that Iâm depressed. She said that the first day she met me. She says Iâm scared. She thinks I should quit my job because of my âdisability.â Or that they should at least be offering me accommodations. She says that I donât tell my husband or my family how I really feel about my Myasthenia Gravis and that I donât allow them to properly support me like I need them to. She says that I need to bring them in for a session so she can mediate and I can tell them how I really feel. 

Iâm not comfortable with that. I donât know how I really feel. I donât want them to know how I really feel. I have spent 5 years protecting them from the burden that is my disease until I canât protect them or myself. My husband and my parents are the most supporting people I have ever met. My mom stays with me when Iâm in the hospital. My husband does anything I ask of him, even if it includes picking me up off the floor when Iâm too weak to stand by myself. But that doesnât mean Iâm going to allow them to see me weak. They already see my muscles weak. I canât be emotionally weak too. 

I donât know what to do about my therapist. I donât know what Iâm supposed to be accomplishing. I mostly just go in there and cry about stuff and then she tells me more about how she wants to talk to my husband and my parents. She also found out about me being a graphic designer and has asked that I do a branding campaign for her. How do you say no to someone youâve only spoken with 3 times about very private matters? Now I feel like thereâs a line thatâs been crossed and itâs not going to get resolved until I finish the work and stop the sessions. 

I donât think Iâm doing any of this right. 

My symptoms are getting worse. I didnât know that Myathenia Gravis was progressive even with treatment. It used to just be my speech and swallowing. Now itâs in my arms and legs and itâs hard to breathe. I had surgery in July to hopefully help get me off some of this medication and stabilize my symptoms. I knew that the surgery could take 2 or 5 years to work. I didnât realize how hard it would be to wait. I didnât realize that I would crash. I was as close to pre-MG normal as I had ever been and I crashed. Hard. I didnât want to acknowledge that the surgery may not work.

I just want to stop crying every time I think about it. I want to stop thinking about it. Itâs like a broken record in my head. All day every day. Except all the record is playing is static because I donât know what Iâm thinking about. Am I scared? Have I isolated myself from any help I may get? All I know is I donât want to be strong anymore. I donât want to be âyouâre so courageous for dealing with this.â I donât want to be. I just want to sleep.

"I have been taking Wellbutrin XL of varying doses since 2012. Within the last nine months, Iâve begun feeling like my blood sugar is low all the time, and Iâve stopped exercising because I felt like I was going to pass out afterward. Some days itâs much worse than others. Numbness and tingling are part of it. 

My psychiatrist is cutting my dosage in half to see if the Wellbutrin is the culprit.

Has anyone else experienced this? It has been very upsetting to not feel good enough to exercise, but Iâm worried about reducing my dosage. Wellbutrin is the medicine that brought me back from feeling suicidal in college. ",3,begun feeling like my blood sugar is low all the time

Not only did I hurt a woman I know, who works at the bar, but also cried infront of everyone. 

Worse thing, it wasn't like normal crying, it was my uncontrolable Depression-Crying. And I never did this infront of my friends. I guess I also kinda drank too much alcohol (which is why I told myself to quit it this year - wish me luck).

I'm not a person to talk about my feelings, since it mostly worsen my depression. Like it does now. I feel so bad, but I pretend like I don't remember infront of the others.

My friends think it was the alcohol, I guess. But it was just a side-effect, comparing to the true reason, which is, that 2017 was one of my worse years by now.

"New Year's Day. What a way to start the year, right? I've spent the last few weeks, maybe months feeling worthless and sad and wanting to die but not wanting to kill myself, so I fantasized about getting into an accident and dying in a way that looked like it wasn't on my own hands. I got out of the car with just some whiplash and some bruises but I'm fine otherwise.

It's a miracle I'm alive right now. I spun out on the freeway going 75 mph. I got hit by another car. The witnesses and patrol officer and the EMT all expected me to be unconscious or way more badly hurt than I was. I don't believe in God, but I do think there was a greater force at work, telling me to stop fantasizing about something so horrible and to get my shit together.

So I'm going to. Phone calls give me anxiety, I know I'm going to have a bout of PTSD related to driving, I'm going to feel guilty about wrecking my parents' car, but I'm okay. Everything is okay.

"I have MS and I have done everything to pull myself together and build a life. It went ok for half a year but then it started. I was VERY motivated for university, I started my first year of physics major in October and made very healthy habits(eating healthy, sports, morning routines, reading every day, planning the day and week, working deeply without distractions, etc.) and it went pretty good. I didn't expect everything to go perfect, far from it, but I did expect to have some control. But then we had to talk about medicine. My parents are superstitious and I am a sceptic; I think critically and I analyse everything to truly understand the situation. My parents wanted to start alternative medicine and I am fine with that for as long as it is not dangerous as I wish to let my parents be at some ease. They found about this Vitamin D3 treatment which can be VERY VERY dangerous(my kidneys can fail any day) and we had soooo mannyy FIGHTS over it, it was chatastrophic. My mum started to hurt me bad with her shit and dad was just ignorant and arrogant. Moreover, the medicine for MS is VERY DANGEROUS as well, a girl of my age got diabetes and Thyroid Disease so she had to even drop out of fucking musical academy which was her dream just because of MEDICINE. We had countless talks and fights and shit ever since my uni has started and everything has gone to SHIT. All my habits are gone, all my plans are ruined and I probably even have depression now.

You see, when I got the MS diagnosis I spent A WEEK having an existential crisis and I really decided I wanted to be a physicists no matter what, as I felt like that is part of my identity, to truly become a master in something. I have decided to be a physicists roughly a year before that, however now that decision became a huge part of my life. But every time we fought at home I couldn't work for days no matter what; I tried to push and concentrate and I even started going to library to study but after a month even that wouldn't help anymore. I have very good friends, but they are of little to no help and I LOVE my parents, but they try way TOO DAMN HARDDDDDDDD, they are beating my mental health down every day. 

For example: yesterday I was feeling very depressed even though I felt motivated the day before, it just came out of the blue, so I was super slow and lazy and it was impossible to get out of bed. My parents saw that and started worrying, the first thing they said is that I need to snap out of it and that im just pretending because I am lazy, do you know how much that hurt????!!!! But I am rational and I was somehow able to keep my anger and sadness and pool of emotions down to explain them FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME what is going on with me and why is it so but they just wouldn't understand! This time they threatened me throwing me out and you know what, I fucking agreed because I was so desperate that I literally thought that there is no other way. I was SO TIRED that I thought this was my destinity, that im such a pure piece of fucking shit that even my parents want to get rid of me. I just wanted to go and just live my life. I even started planning on how to get a job and shit, it was PURE TORTURE. I have cooled down since then, but now I have not worked for school yet again and I am even more behind, yet fucking again, will it ever end? Why am I even trying with bloody physics which is HARD when I know I have such a terrible condition. I magically passed almost all the midterms and everyone was happy that I did and they kept saying I am amazing and shit, I was so angry because NO ONE understood how much I am suffering because I am not able to learn 10% of what I should be learning, its like being a kid in front of a toy store looking through glass at a toy you wanna sooo desperately have but you KNOW you will never have it. I even tried to talk to a psychologist and it helped the first day and I was so happy that I finally had some real help, but then she said she would call me next week for next talk from the meeting but she never called and it has been a month since then now and I dont even know her name nor can I contact her, she is a psychologist at the hospital! I feel so dead, I don't knwo what to do. Every singe day I fight myself, I fight to gather some energy and motivation to do the work and have fun, but every week is ruined by fighting with parents and now almost every day is ruined by just being empty, dead without energy and tired and with hate for myself and shit. 

I feel lonely, not understood, desperate, without any energy(cannot even have fun, im forcing myself to have fun more than actually having it), im scared all the time, i feel like people just wanna quickly be done with me cuz im a burden, i have insomnia, i sleep too long, sometimes i cant eat at all while on other times i binge eat like crazy and i find myself looking for food every 2 minutes, im scared of studying, im scared of talking to anyone but a professional cuz they wont understand, Im overthinking all the time, i cannot concentrate anymore at all(e.g. got a huge burst of motivation cuz of a fight few days ago and started to work on math but it lasted 15 minutes and then i felt HUGE resistance and my mind went batshit crazy). The only thing missing is the thought of kling myself, but i doubt it will ever cross my mind for more than 5 seconds, as I am rational enough AND I know very well that life is beautiful and valuable. I just CANNOT find a way out of my situation, im caught in this room with walls closing in on myself, but there has to be a way out, but im close to breaking, right now I spend 90% of the time being depressed and then I have these rational outbursts that are seemingly the product of my past self and they seem to protect me and that is why I am here and not dead yet. My healtjh is getting much worse though and MS is getring worse too, ive gotten a new attack a few months ago and it is still active, I cant feel my feet normal anymore, i feel much less and the feeling is weird and its driving me fucking crazy, tho i have gotten a bit used to it. Now I do t even know how I feel about my parents, i fucking love them, but at the same time i hate them for driving me crazy, but i dont blame them, but i still do, but I really really do not know how to feel about them. For new year they were all kind and shit but i cannot take this kindness seriously anymore. I know they mean it but i cannot smile normally i cannot be happy. But i still want to be on good terms with them. What a shitty family we are.

I posted this here to gather some feedback information, new ideas, or new information to help myself because I do not want to give up, ever, for I still believe I can become a physicist, even if it sounds fucking stupid. If there is ONE FUCKING THING that I want to do in my entire life is to research physics and solve math problems. As you can see, I still have MS to deal with, so even if I somehow deal with depression, I will still have this monster over my head which could strike me down any time. For example, how will i deal with a family, I cannot imagine putting such a massive burden on someone I would love, will I ever even have a wife and kids?(I hugely respect what Hawking did and I think it was the right thing to do)

"This is my first time posting here. I have been mentally going downhill for a few years now. About 3 years ago my dad got sick with cancer and went through all the treatments, radiation, surgeries, chemotherapy and eventually when all else failed, immunotherapy. He ended up in the ICU on a ventilator for a few weeks until he ultimately passed away. This whole experience broke me. He was my person. My mom and I aren't very close. I have no other close family members. I definitely felt myself slipping once he got sick and then watching him get worse and worse. He died in April and I've been functioning but I feel fucking terrible most days. I wake up feeling so shitty, like complete despair. I feel like this planet and most of the people on it suck to be frank. I never had a clear cut direction or passions to follow so I find myself thinking about my purpose a lot. I do wish I could end my life some days but I know I never will. 

I go to therapy. I have tried some medications but honestly I haven't found anything that works. I don't enjoy anything really so I don't have hobbies. I do have a fiance. He is a saint. He's my only real support. He's been getting me through.

"So I'm 23, I've survived two rare cancers that have badly affected my education in high school and university. I graduated university with a bachelor degree in business but my GPA is horrible, as my physical and mental health during my studies was terrible. My grades improved over time but the damage was done. I'm now looking for my first full-time job (I have a year of part-time work experience) and have had no luck since graduating in August of 2017. 

Its gotten so bad that I constantly doubt myself, I feel that I am stupid and really have no future prospects in terms of career. I constantly use various tools to try to justify to myself that I'm not a failure (such as IQ/Psychological Tests), but they really don't mean anything. I feel that I have to justify myself for things outside that were out of my control and obviously, people in the real world don't care and will more than often see me as a liability.
On top of this, due to my treatment of my second cancer, my left arm lacks fine motor skills. I'm already handicapped in the competitive job market and why would any employer hire me over some other graduate with better marks and is physically capable. 

My personal confidence is at an all-time low as well, being a 5'4ft balding 23-year-old doesn't help me fit in and frankly, with my understanding of how nature works, I am screwed. I am working on improving my overall physical fitness and am I by no means anti-social but I feel that I can't relate to any of my peers.

No one helped me during my life (outside of my family) and I have no idea what I want to do, I'm not passionate about helping others or any career objectivities or anything at all. I just want to work and be productive so that I can reach a point where I don't have to be. 

I think that I am an intelligent, moral person that can actually bring some value to whatever I do but no one is going to give me chance, because why would they? I don't want to end up on welfare and I want a successful career, I don't want to be rich or famous, I just want a purpose. Sure, it's my fault, I could of done better and now just like most of my life, I have to learn the hard way.   

What do I do? Do I go back and study something else to gain a better GPA (and more student debt)? I don't really have many options. Even if I go study something in demand, like engineering or IT, who is going to hire someone in a hands-on profession who can't fully use both hands?

"Hello r/depression,

Recently I have finally made sure that my tolerance to all kinds of psychiatric medicines is higher than average. That is, I have to take doses higher than average / recommendation to achieve the same level of therapeutic effects.

I just wanna preface by saying that I'm going to talk about 3 different girls in my life, 2 of which are integral to this, (A and B), however I want to say I'm not depressed because of girls, I wouldn't be posting here if it was just about heartbreak (not that there is anything wrong with that, I just don't want people to get that imoression from this)

I've suffered from depression off/on since I was about 15, so it's been 8 almost 9 years. By off/on I mean it has hills and valleys, it's always kind of there, but at the same time kind of can go away? I don't know if that makes much sense.. right now, and definitely for the past 6 months, it's the longest time I've ever spent at the bottom of a valley, and it also happens to be one of the deepest I've ever been down. 

I'm definitely an ugly duckling story. A lot of my depression started originally as an awkward teen, I had long emo hair, I was very skinny and always have been, I was shy, had very bad social anxiety to the point I would vomit all the time, even when at school and going out with friends. I never liked the town I grew up in, people knew me to be a certain way or thing, that when I tried to change it just didn't work.. 

Fast forward from when I was 15 and when I finally moved out and went to college, at 18, I had truly 'blossomed'. I looked good. And for my 4 years at college I slayed. I've been with over 100 women, spent my nights going out partying, spending all my time with friends.. everything went away, my anxiety, my depression and my awkwardness. 

During that time however, I experienced an emotionally abusive relationship with girl A (protecting names).. this was in the early days, and she amplified all my problems tenfold (until I finally escaped and my mental health improved).

I met the girl of my dreams (at the time) when I was 20, and things were great until it ended, which sent me in to a spiral of sleeping with so many women to block out my feelings, I drank a shit tonne, I even did drugs (I'm not proud of it, and it was completely against character, I regret it deeply, but I'm just glad I wasn't hurt nor did I hurt anyone else during that time). This continued for a few months, and I finished college, jumped from job to job and had no clue where my life was going.. 

Then I met B. I met her just before I turned 22, and it was the best thing that's ever happened to me. She took away my pain and gave me help and support to steady myself in a way that nobody else ever had. I was so shut off from feelings and shut off from wanting to show emotion, that it took her a while for me to get me out of my cage that I had locked myself if.. but it was great, and I will always appreciate her for that... 

I moved home from Aberdeen where I had been to do college, due to a failed business attempt, and my flatmate was moving away too. B was staying in Aberdeen, and we decided on a ""long distance"" relationship. And it was fine, no problems whatsoever. I only lived a couple hours away on the train, so I saw her basically every weekend. Whilst home I started working with my dad, and just wanted to save money up. 

One day, girl A messaged me.. I didn't want anything to do with her but B told me to forgive her and be friends.. I guess she was just too trusting. I decided to tell A I forgive her and we can be friends, but I never messaged her or anything and was just polite when she messaged me, but in all I left her alone.. This is the part that makes my blood boil, and makes my heart ache.. B and I fell out over a friend she had trying to say shit about me.. (she hated me, and I had no reason why).. that night I messaged A and we had deep chats and one thing lead to another and flirtatious texts were sent and a couple photos. I felt horrible. And I stupidly kept it a secret.. this all happened in January or last year.. and then in June of last year, girl A told girl B everything, as I had deleted and blocked A out of my life and she didn't like that... I have no clue what sparked it.. my only regret is I wasn't considerate and honest enough to tell B about what I did... 

Flash forward to today and I'm alone.. and have been since June. And this brings me to how I currently feel, and why I'm frustrated with where I'm at.. obviously going through college taught me how to break out of my depression, and I've been trying to follow it but... Nothings working and has started revealing more problems.. 

If you've made it this far then thank you so much. There's not much more to read. 

I feel now lost more than ever. I've been going to the gym constantly almost every day for the past 4 months, to stay healthy and hoping it would keep me busy. I've gained weight, and physically I feel incredible. I've gone from 9st 9lbs to 11st and I feel I've finally escaped skinny me and all the people that made fun of my for looking like a rake (girl A). But it's not helped how I feel in my head.. 

I don't feel connected to my friends anymore, they've all moved away and I rarely get to see them, and most messaged go unanswered for days because they're busy.. I only have one friend that still lives in my town, and it pains me to say but I feel like the relationship isn't what it once was, and that we've gone on different paths, so it just feels awkward when I see him, however I do try to keep it going because I know isolation KILLS. 

I spend time with my family a lot, I love my family and they're very supportive and understand how I feel. However it just doesn't feel the same as hanging out with friends, and I find myself getting frustrated being around them a lot, even though they've shown me nothing but love, and it makes me feel even more awful feeling that way.

I've thrown myself in to further studies and with work. I'm studying accounting niw to keep busy, and I work hard at my job to keep busy and give me money. I spend all my time working, studying, gyming, hanging out with family, and trying to see friends, so my life is full, but my heart just feels empty. I feel like I'm rotting from the inside.. 

I also don't connect with any of the things that once we're a great pastime for me.. video games just aren't the same as they were, I don't connect to any of the nerdy shit I used to like and I don't know what else to be interested in.. 

And finally.. I miss girl B. I no longer contact her, as I know she hates me for betraying her. I know she's getting on with her life, new man, working hard, all that.. I've deleted and blocked her from everything and haven't looked to see what she's up to (I just know what she's up to due to a friend telling me without me asking which felt like a fucking knife..). The old 20 year old me wants to hook up with girls and ""get under someone to get over someone"" but, I can't. My head and heart won't let me. I've tried meeting up with a couple girls but I just can't get in to it at all, and I have no desire to be with them.. 

Just to put a cherry on top the ice cream, girl A is now dating a friend who lives back in Aberdeen, so I've decided to cut him out of my life.. because I can't have any connection to girl A.. that's done a lot of horrible things to me in my life. 

I don't know if any of this makes sense at all, or if I even deserve to be posting here.. I'm working hard, going to gym, even seeing a therapist, keeping busy as all hell.. but still I feel so numb inside and wake up crying at night, unable to get my head and heart to agree to keep looking to the future..

"Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram  (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out.  I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug? Thanks 

TLDR: Scared of the sexual side effects of Celexa, any positive experiences to ease my worry? ",3,Scared of the sexual side effects of Celexa
"Hey guys, so this might be a little long but I'll put a tl:dr at the end.

I've had depression ranging from severe to moderate (depending on the month tbh) for the past couple of years along with social/general anxiety, kickstarted by the loss of my dad and made worse through by going through college with 0 friends and having absolutely nothing social to do. Last year I went to a psychiatrist who put me on Paxil, told me it'd do away with both my depression and anxiety and gave me a bunch of BS advice about how to make friends and the like (common sense type stuff I already know and try). Well after a month of Paxil I kinda turned into a different person, my anxiety was completely gone but my depression was through the roof, leading to me making a LOT of bad decisions. I went back to my psychiatrist telling him that I didn't think it was helping my depression, and he said that's normal and upped my dose from 20mg to 30mg. This made everything WAY worse; I felt like I was slightly drunk all the time (only comparison I can think of), and my inhibitions were like always gone. I started smoking cigarettes, hiring escorts, getting in fights with people for no reason, just crazy shit I NEVER would have done before. My general anxiety came back and then some, I started having panic attacks almost daily, hobby's I used to love just seemed worthless and boring, it just made everything I took it to prevent worse. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but on Paxil they were daily. It culminated in my roommates having an intervention with me telling and reminding me of everything I'd done and just how much more of a miserable asshole I'd become. So I stopped taking the Paxil (those brain zaps were fun) and went back to my psychiatrist explaining all of this to him, and he told me it had nothing to do with the Paxil and I just wasn't following his advice (which consisted of ""talk to people"", ""you don't need friends in college"", ""girls will like you when you have a successful career in the future"").

Since being off the Paxil I have gone back to my old self, my roommates and my family have both told me I seem back to normal, I feel like I used to, I can enjoy video games and fishing again, but I'm still just as depressed and anxious as I was before the Paxil (plus now I'm hooked on cigarettes, so thanks for that Paxil). I went to my primary care doctor last week and explained all of this to him, and he recommended I see a psychologist, and gave me a script for 25mg Zoloft and .5mg Klonopin. I'm working on finding a psycologist at the moment, and the Klonopin helps a lot with my anxiety (though I know it's a benzo and not a long term solution), but I'm literally terrified to start Zoloft. I don't want to go through another experience like Paxil, I can say without a doubt that those 5 months were the worst most shameful and miserable of my life. So, with all that said, does anyone know if Zoloft is likely to cause this misery again? Or really does anyone just have any advice for me? I feel like I'm in a pit and everything they give you just digs the pit even deeper, I just need some advice.

TL:DR - Was prescribed Paxil for 5 months, turned me into a monster and made me feel absolutely terrible. Now have a 25mg Zoloft perscription and am terrified of what's gonna happen when I take it.

"In all honesty I'm not quite at the end of my rope, but I am doing pretty damn badly and I will be there one day if things don't change. I can barely talk to anyone, there's a barrier of thoughts, feelings and behaviours in my head and it makes me feel depressed all the time. CBT seems like it would help me so much, but I have no energy or focus or bother to stick with it or believe in it.

 I don't want medication to be a crutch. I want it to be a stepping stone up. I know I can be okay. I'm already somewhat half-okay, I'm on the right track, I just need to be able to change a few core behaviours and thoughts. On paper, medication would help with this. But the more I read, the more shit-scared I get. Seems like there's almost nothing but negative experiences online. Side effects, people literally becoming dumber/having cognitive impairment, people losing sexual function for months, years, sometimes forever, SSRIs being glorified placebos with side effects, heroin-like withdrawals, people tapering off and having their depression/anxiety later come back doubled, etc. It all just seems like some impossible insidious trap. The more I read the more I almost cannot believe these are prescribed.

 I'm not trying to be a fear-monger here. I've read some best-case scenarios of people going on medication, switching across a few until they found one without side effects, staying on it for only a few months or years until things were better, then slowly stepping off them and continuing to be okay, using the techniques and habits they built while on medication. Maybe all the bad things I've read are because people experiencing negative effects are more likely to be on reddit telling others about it. But there's just a sea of negative experiences, side effects and anecdotes out there which are impossible to ignore.

"Wall of text. Feel free to skip. I should say my psychiatrist did his fellowship at Johns Hopkins, the best medical school, and the ECT head went to Stanford and is certified in ect and connected to the (well-respected medical) university here (Tampa)

I have been diagnosed variously schizophrenia /schizoaffective /and even bipolar. I was in a psych ward and left for dead pretty much at 18, recovered completely after detox from a crazy psych cocktail, got B. A, M. A. even taught abroad. Had a very stressful illness in a minor city in China and whatever medicine given either caused or exacerbated some delusional thinking. But I recovered in a major Chinese city on what I assume was sedatives. When I got back to the US I couldn't sleep and eventually went on the antipsychotic paliperidone and klonopin after trying various medicines including trazodone and got a job teaching English as a second language at a university , but decided to go off the antipsychotic , which went poorly as heavy depression set in again sparked by illness followed by psychosis and hospitalization twice, both psychosis remitting after a few days. Stayed on the paliperidone. 

Flash forward to this fall. Eventually decided I'd had enough of the inhuman feeling of paliperidone, I became ridiculously depressed and was having issues with my body freezing in place and moving in genral. One medicine (memantine) I took made me suicidal to the extent that i was arrested and involuntarily held in a hospital that my neurologist had suggested I get ect in if Ativan didn't work. (he also diagnosed multifocal dystonia and catatonia, which the catatonia the psychiatrists didn't seem to agree with) 

I was lucky because psychotic depression set in mildly after a few days in the psych ward but no one noticed and the next day I had ect. Been through four sessions since. After the first, the suicidality and inability to move much and psychotic depression went away, and, eventually, after a few weeks, I began to feel a sense of happiness for the first time in at least ten years  

I've tried and has bad reactions to pretty much every atypical antipsychotic on the market, and been shot with Haldol at least 4 times. Also tried pristiq and wellbutrin with suicidal thoughts as side effects for the first one and clonus for the second, which I thought may have to do with serotonin syndrome

Currently taking klonopin 1mg 2x a day only. Psychiatrist thinks some people are not fit for antipsychotics as I always get all the side effects (Same with antidepressants)

Lately every morning when I wake up I have this ANNOYING tingly feeling in my intensities. The same feeling you get when you're weightless (freefalling).

Also, I have a very negative thought pattern. I always look back on events (doesnt matter how small or big) and think negatively, or how it impacts me in a negative manner. This is also a very big part of my social anxiety. I always look back and think about the shit that makes me appear fucked-up instead of the things that make me appear awesome. 

I cant get out of bed easily, I avoid most social situations, I smoke weed daily and cant stop, I take drugs (one or a combo of the following: alcohol/ghb/2cb/nitrous/speed/4fmp/xtc/mdma/cocaine/ketamine) every weekend, I cant get a girlfriend because of my anxiety while my friends and siblings can, Even the fucking gym doesnt really

As my title says, depression has ruined my life. I've just broken up with my fiancÃ© because she found out I cheated on her. I know that makes me pure scum but it's made me realise how much I'm struggling to cope with life and that I need (and am getting) help. 

I've bottled up my depression for years which lead to ""episodes"". These ranged from assaults (which lead to nights in the cells), drug abuse, alcohol abuse, fits of anger, compulsive lying, erratic behaviour, and, at my lowest, cheating. Each of these came with extreme lows and ever increasing suicidal thoughts. I realised something needed to change soon or I would end it - it was that simple. 

It was my ex that told me to get help. It was my mum that came with me to my first counselling session (2nd one later this week) and to the GP (doctor). Both of these experiences were terrifying but extremely helpful. The GP is going to be putting me on antidepressants as he explained that I needed help with the low feelings I was having. I go back tomorrow once the GP has checked that a previous medical condition won't affect my treatment. 

I'm not sure I'm going to get through this as I'm still thinking about suicide almost every hour, but I'm going to try. I'm not willing to throw away the best 5 years of my life for nothing and I hope when I get better that I can try and rekindle my relationship and give my perfect girl the life she deserves.

"A few months ago (possibly more, my perception of time isn't great right now) my best friend started having seizures, and a tumour was discovered in his brain. Since then he's been through various rounds of radio and chemotherapy, and today had the results back from a recent scan. The tumour has reduced massively in size, and the parts they were really concerned with appear to be gone. This is brilliant news! And while I feel a sense of relief, and am no longer fixated on ""what if it's terminal?"", I just can't seem to feel any positivity. I don't want this to have an impact on our relationship, but I feel like I'm withdrawing and slipping away from him. We used to live together, but he's back living with his parents (since before the tumour) due to other issues.

"I tried to post this on a proof reading sub but it's pretty inactive. 

After a long struggle I recently decided to seek medical help and was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Although i finally have a plan towards recovery and medication as my tool, i chose to seek help after this past semester had ended. 

Due to my mental illness I couldn't do my best academically to get out of my academic probation (a result of failing to seek help earlier than later) and such I'm facing dismissal from my college. All i needed is one more semester to graduate. 

But there is hope :), I chose to appeal the dismissal and had to write a 3 paragraph max explaining the circumstances that affected my academic performance and a plan towards success. 

Here is a link to guidelines and my finished petition: https://drive.google.com/open?id=11g3mmfG5uUOe5wCMQZlUZKpZgzp-HZRf

All i ask is for someone to please proof read the short petition for me. Or offer suggestions. Its due Jan the 9th but I want to finish it and submit it ASAP. 

Thank you!

Even my school days werenât great; debagged in public, constantly hit in testicles throughout school (had to have an operation to remove cyst down there)

Is this depression / anxiety? I just need to get answers to help. No one seems to know how I feel inside, I guess I just hide it well.",3," had third degree burns to feet due to accident not my fault,  when I finally got back to work I now have a hernia,Within a space of 2-3 months"

"The past few years I've been going through some mental health changes that have become quite alarming. I was feeling generally down and had tried to combat it with exercise, surrounding myself with positivity, trying new hobbies, etc. Slowly things started to change, I was becoming anxious around crowds, I'd get flustered in grocery stores when crowded, started feeling like I wanted to avoid the gym because of people, crying became a regular thing and my family's life started to revolve around if I was going to get triggered by something negative which would send me into a spiral of sadness or anger. This is not typical of me and I'm watching it unravel in front of me. I feel crazy! I started getting into these fogs, nothing seemed to be as exciting as they should be to me, go to an amusement park? Get new camera equipment? Go hiking? I love those things but all of a sudden it just felt like they were happening around me and I was just there, just experiencing it, and it didn't feel good to me the way it should. Suicidal thoughts always accompanied my bouts of sadness, so I decided to get some help.

I went to see a counselor about how I was feeling. It was my first attempt to reach out and it went awful. Firstly, I should have mentioned that I had suicidal thoughts, but I didn't as I was ashamed of it, felt like it made me weak or that it would sound extreme. The councelor told me to stop pestering my family and that regardless if I went to therapy or took meds, they wouldn't work. That medication wouldn't work and that their therapist wouldn't have time to fit me in with their schedule and that I'd probably only get seen for 30 minutes at a time. I left feeling defeated and tried to use that to motivate myself to beat this on my own.

The past 6 months things have gotten worse. I was alarmed that one day I started feeling tired, like I was just done with ""feeling"" and wanted to die. It felt so casual to me to think that I wanted to electrocute myself in the bathtub and that it felt relieving to see a way to end this overwhelming feeling. I told my spouse to help me because I'm about to kill myself and I don't want to die, but I desperately hate this overwhelming whiplash.

We agree to try getting help again, but I put it off thinking I can try again to defeat it myself. Now, I've started getting panic attacks at the slightest hint of stress. It's like my brain is breaking. I start to hyperventilate and struggle to breathe. I've been getting sent into emotional spirals more often and again, I started thinking if I took some pain pills I could slit my throat in the bathtub.

My appointment is in a few days and I'm really nervous. I'm really sad about it because I feel like I'm crazy. I know that other doctor was wrong, but I'm afraid if this new doctor will be the same. I'm struggling so hard and I can't help myself anymore. I want to get help and I feel like I'm crazy that this is all happening because it's not me. I don't want to be like this and I don't want to have to live like this, in fear of my own self and getting triggered into sadness or hopelessness.

I don't want to self diagnose, but I think something is wrong with me. This is definitely not normal to me.

TL;DR: Can you give any tips as to handle talking to my doctor about all this? What do I say, what is important to mention?",3,"went to therapy or took meds, they wouldn't work. That medication wouldn't work and that their therapist wouldn't have time to fit me"

The only enjoyment I've had my winter break or the past few years is when I get high with hydrocodone or other pills. Haven't left my house to do anything in years. (Besides school which is hell as well.) No one ever texts me or care s so I dont see the point in living anymore! I'm tired of being alone, unhappy and worthless.

"I used to lead a successful life and was proud of how simple and easy my life had turned into, and I believed that my purpose in life was to show everyone around me how to live successfully without disrespecting anyone or any rules and without cutting corners.  In essence I felt that I held the key to happiness and was eager to share it with anyone who was willing to follow my example.

Unfortunately, 4 years ago I went blind due to a congenital glaucoma, and was totally unprepared for that even though it was highly likely to happen during my lifetime.  At the beginning I was positive about the whole situation, so I went to a blind rehabilitation center thinking that after coming out I would pick up where I left and continue to be an example to others, but I totally underestimated the mental drag that comes with being blind.  I started seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist shortly after going blind, and in 4 years I had 3 psychologists and 2 psychiatrists tel me that I show no signs of clinical depression beyond wanting to die, so I'm not taking any meds.

The problem is that my life is no longer simple like before, as the strategies required to live blind make even the smallest problems a challenge to solve thus creating a huge mental drag that makes everything extremely unpleasant to do, and I know that these problems aren't going away as there is absolutely nothing I or anyone else can do to return my life to what it was.  I'm also no longer an example to anyone as I have become extremely dependent, not because I don't want to do things but rather because I refuse to accept that I'm blind and have to do them differently, so the only way I see out of this is killing myself, but even that becomes much harder to do blind.",3," 4 years ago I went blind due to a congenital glaucoma,problem is that my life is no longer simple like before, as the strategies required to live blind make even the smallest problems a challenge to solve thus creating a huge mental drag"
"Recently I received some bad news at home â another health issue one would think would never impact me, even indirectly.  I donât want to get into those details, but it led me to decide I needed to stop medication because my âluckâ is so bad no matter how good the medication I am still going to endure an incessant stream of negative events and circumstances that will overwhelm me.  My life is a story of waste: Brilliant, but not using that brain power at work; successful, but not enough to reach my goals.  Nothing ever comes easy and I see bad people left and right get their way.  It drives me nuts, and feeds into the âblack and white thinkingâ that plagues me.  So I met with my doctor to ask how to get off my medication altogether.  Previously, he expressed shock at the cocktail I was taking and said he would not continue the malpractice of my old doctor, who recently closed her practice.  He did not try to convince me to stay on the medication, or change to something else.  Iâm thankful he was honest about the methods to get off the pills.  But, it turns out the safe way to get off my medications will require over a year of weaning off them.  I wanted to stop going to doctors soon, but now I have to go through this process for over a year.  I handled the news well, surprisingly well. Still, it is incredibly difficult to live with my negative thinking, disturbing life events, a constant sense of failure and inadequacy, and potential withdrawals so serious I have to go through a year of tapering off meds.  I just needed to vent.  I feel like I have no one and nothing.  I constantly mutter things under my breath (often without realizing it) such as âI hate my life.â  Itâs just hard to see how the story of my life turns out well.",3,"constant sense of failure and inadequacy, and potential withdrawals so serious I have to go through a year of tapering off meds"

"I created this account to seek advice as I would prefer to protect the privacy of my wife and her brother - don't mind the vast emptiness of my post history. If this is the wrong place to post this or if someone knows a better sub, please let me know and I will remove / x-post as needed.

I have tried to assist my brother-in-law over the course of three years in a multitude of ways but I am not sure if there will ever be anything that can truly be ""done"" for him - thus I am reaching out to see if anyone has a different take on it all. Obviously there will be big chuncks of information that will be omitted due to space / time / privacy / etc reasons but I'll try to express everything the best I can. My background is homeless youth (troubled home, graduated high school late, etc) and then military service for nearly a decade, 37 yrs old now.

My brother-in-law (Let's call him BIL or BILL for short) was under the care of a psychaiastrist from the age of 12 to 28 yrs old (when the doctor retired). This psychiastrist medicated Bill with Adderall and clonazepam under the diagnosis of depression and ADHD. When Bill talks to me about this doctor he readily admits that he thinks the relationship had crossed the line between doctor-patient and that the doctor probably prescribed whatever Bill wanted.

From what I have been told from Bill's mom, dad and siblings, and Bill himself, Bill was a smart kid but wasn't someone who had any particular interest (no chess team, choir, sports, etc) and was pretty anti-social. Bill started drinking around age 16 as he felt him fit in.

Bill graduated from his very religious school and upbringing on time. He went into a custodial position right after HS and went to college for a portion of a year but dropped out. From that point forward, Bill lived with girlfriends and could hold a  job for about a fifth of a year up until I met the family. I emplyed Bill for about a year where I found that he was a hard worker but he required (I mean literally) constant supervision and instruction. Bill is not an idiot. I want to be clear about this. Bill is obviously an intelligent man who has a lot of potentional. With that said, he doesn't seem to have the ability to link the multiple steps from the beginning of a problem to the conclusion of the fix. Think about if I asked you to install a toilet - most of us, if we did not know what to do, would look up a video or read the instructions that were included. Bill would instead plan a large and very complicated process that would end up consuming an entire day without Bill being able to really explain what he did all day and why the toilet wasn't installed. However, if I explained the process up front or told Bill to look up a video, the task would get completed well and with quality. Bill has been pretty blunt in our conversations in that he says he has never paid a single dollar towards any rent in his life.

Bill expresses deep depression often, self-harms (and tells me that it's only for attention) and will actively sabotage any efforts to assist him. A good example is that he will discuss the desire to move into a support house so he can be around others going through this. He will make appointments, will ask me for a ride (where I will take time off work) and then on the day of the appointment, will reschedule the event (key point here that I didn't say ""cancel the event"") and proceed to get smashed drunk. I only find out after I have driven an hour and a half to pick him up that he is passed out drunk on his mom's sofa.

So that is Bill in a nutshell.

Bill's mother was, by my defination, an enabler to the extreme. She acted completely dumbfounded each and everytime Bill is drunk / quits a job / gets arrested / etc. She will take even the most obvious lies he spins as facts. I had been around for when Bill would tell her, slurring words and stumbling, that he isn't drunk and she would believe him, chalking it up to ""Bill must be tired"". This continued all the way up until earlier this year when she realized that if she kept cleaning up after him, he would kill himself (driving drunk, alcohol poisioning, self harm that went wrong). We have paid for Bill to go through five rehabs over the last 3 years and used state rehabs twice as we no longer have the funds for private help. Bill's girlfriend finally got tired of everything and booted him out. He moved in with his mother until recently when the local PD had arrested Bill six times in two weeks for PIs and trespassing. At that point we took him to a state rehab in Fort Worth, Tx to try yet again.

Bill finished the rehab about a month ago, got drunk and is now living homeless in the FTW area. He keeps in touch regulary (I cover his phone expenses, provided him with cold weather gear, shelter info, and visit him weekly). He has been hospitalized twice for alcohol poisoning over teh last month but still refuses to follow-up on the resources that are offered to him. I was tehre for both ER stays (both turned into 3-4 day in-patient stays) where the nurses and doctors offered him help but he never showed up to any of the follow-up visits. Bill's entire family ahs told him many, many times that we are all here for him.

I care about Bill but the most painful part of all this (for me) is I see how much of a toll this takes on my wife. She is a recovering addict (4 years sober!) and she has an intimate understanding of the pain and physical harm that can evolve from Bill's situation. I have spent many nights going to NAR-Anon groups trying to learn to be as supportative as I can for my wife but with Bill, I honestly have no idea what else I have to offer. My wife has remained sober as she makes that choice every single morning to be sober.

I guess after writing all this I have a fairly simple question for a very complicated situation - Can someone tell me stories about what has helped others / themselves in the past that might have seen any of this?

I know there are some folks out there that can't be helped. Others still can be helped but only they can start the process. If we can't help Bill, what can I say to the family to help (as much as is possible in this situation)?

Thanks for anyone's time who reads this and thanks even more for anyone who has even the slightest advice for us to help Bill.

"So I guess this started when my dad had his stroke...physically he came out fine, but mentally not so much. He is angry, mentally abusive, short tempered, and has started abusing alcohol like I have never seen him do before in the almost 30 years I've been around. His is still my dad' and I still love him' but it has been a tough couple months. I have drawn the longer of the sticks, because unlike my mother and my sister I don't live at home so I only see him a few times a week, when they have to deal with his abuse everyday. 

I do what I can to be a support for them, I've always been a person who could be strong for another person (especially my mom). She leans on me with all her problems (financial and mental) mostly dealing with her depression that stem back to losing her own mom. It doesn't bother me when she calls me sad because usually she just needs to vent and everything is ok. 

But now its different

One, it's not just my mom calling it's my sister also, who I have never had to worry about because she is a mentally strong person, but now I feel my dad is breaking her down and she isn't strong enough to deal with my dad and be the shoulder for my mom who is starting to spiral. Two, my mom will not seek help (even though she has in the past), and my sister mentioned she has been making suicidal comments (which I'm not sure if she did that when she first dealt with depression, I was pretty young and don't remember). 

We are a fairly poor family who has managed to get by, but it's not like we can afford a psychologist. Which is part of the reason I have taken the role of being the person everyone in the family vents to. 

So I guess what I'm asking the reddit community if anyone takes the time to read all this is....

1. Has anyone dealt with a stroke victim like this before and how did they handle it.
2. How do I keep my younger sister sane when she means so much to me, and I hate to see her fall into depression like my mom has in the past
3. How do I get my mom to seek whatever help is out there, and are there any freeish psychs out there that help people who are in a deep state of depression.
4. How do I try to stay strong when my entire family is falling apart and I feel so helpless and scared.

Sorry for the probably million misspellings, it's been a long day and I'm tired. 

Thanks to anybody who has been through something similiar and can possibly help. Part of this might just be I needed to vent, and had no one to turn to. Thanks to reddit, when you can't turn to anyone now you can turn to everyone.

P.S. if you are a depressed person seak help, it's not selfish, it's not just sadness, it's a disease. ",3,"my dad had his stroke...physically he came out fine, but mentally not so much.

"SO I have struggled with clinical depression my entire life, and I see a psychaitrist/therapist, and I talk with my therapist and something I struggle with the most is I can be hard on myself/expect a lot of out myself, and always feel overwhelming guilty, or like a failure, or worthless, or disgusting when I don't do something right or make a mistake. And I don't know if what happened this time is one of those cases where I am being too hard on myself or if I should feel horrible and guilty.

So I also do drink with friends usually once a week or so (at a bar, friends house, or my place), but I know how dangerous it can be to drink with depression and sometimes I have gotten too drunk so I really try to be conscious and drink responsibly when I do. And last night I had like 5 friends over for a girl's night, and we all drank and had fun drunk talk until like 5am, and it was really great and fun and I think I drank just the right amount (enough to have a good time but not enough to go overboard), but at the very end of the night I guess I had one last drink too many because the last hour of the night is fuzzy (like I kind of remember the last hour but not fully)....and I didn't do anything bad or embarassing in regards to hanging out with my friends, but when I woke up (and this is what I feel disgusting and guilty about) I discovered I wet the bed!!! And i feel horrible and disgusting that I let myself drink that much again that I fucking wet the bed? like i feed so ashamed and horrible and gross and disgusting. and im so sad becase it was a really great and fun night otherwise but i feel like this ruins the entire memory too because i just feel so ashamed and guilty and disgusting. Like even being able to type this out was hard because I feel so horrible and ashamed. And I live with my husband and I made sure to clean it up so he wouldn't find out and not even tell him because I felt so ashamed (I ended up falling asleep on the guest bed in a different room than him where me and my friends were hanging out)

"I was first diagnosed as depression then later, bipolar. But  I had this problem ever since I started to take the meds.

I try SO hard to maintain the so called âhappyâ mood. I just try so hard to keep my depressions down below the surface so I donât effect others around me.

But whenever someone ruins my mood, I get uncontrollably mad and I begin to yell at them things I would never say to them. I get strong urge to throw stuff or hit that person but I know thatâs wrong in the inside so I try to keep that under control. What I canât control is yelling and cursing. I just get so mad at the fact that they have ruined my mood, which I have been trying so hard to maintain.

Maybe Iâm just tired of everything. Honestly I am sick of changing my meds to find the ârightâ one and the side effects are killing me. I am seriously lacking memories and verbal skills and that stresses me out greatly. I am sick of depression and I hate myself for not being who I am before I was diagnosed. Whatâs wrong with me? Is this real me? I would never curse at someone or yell at them, but now look at me full of anger and madness.

I just want to end my life seriously. I donât want to hurt any more feelings of my loved ones and I hate myself for even thinking about hurting them when I was mad and uncontrollable. Does anyone else have this problem??",3," first diagnosed as depression then later, bipola"
"Hey People of Reddit,

I don't know if Im actually depressed, but I may be depressed at times and I feel like I could do so much with life but I can't.


Quick list of my issues :
First off the weed/hash issue.
Im addicted to this shit. I don't do it socially I do it at home at my computer mostly because im a big computer tech geek person. I get high and enjoy my time alone just doing nothing but shit..the thc makes nothing great. 
weed is my biggest life killer...I skipped high school so much in my life and had crazy allergies and always felt sick so I kind of fucked up my education only to realise in my mid 20s that Im allergic to weed and it makes me have a runny nose the next day and itchy eyes and I have asthma so I breath badly when i smoke a lot in the next couple days and get bloated and just feel so shitty.. so that fucked with my education..im 28 now. I think it fucked my social life too and Iv know this for a couple years and I don't wanna smoke but i just cant stop I hate myself its a real addiction. It makes me not wanna hang with people or go in public due to paranoid thoughts. It fucks up my motivation and ambition and i just work in a call center ( which im a top seller at ) but its such a low income and low ambition job.

I don't have many friends and I honestly hate a lot of people , in my experience I don't meet or attract cool people at all. 

I have a gf and shes so cool and so like me..shes a little bit of a problem drinker and weve been together for 3 years and have had our ups and downs. 

Im a 5'11 wide guy with muscles..I should weigh 200 but i weigh 250 and its a drag and im self conscious about my tummy even if it isnt huge but its still a fat tummy. I have issues with my knees and back ( ashritis since im 15 and medication doesnt really help much anymore ).

I used to play hockey a lot and with the boys we would go out and shit it was a good way of having friends who are men in my life but since the past 3 years iv torn my groin ( sports hernia ) twice which will have you not doing sports for about a year every time you tear it. Hockey was my life and its fucking gone and I feel like it will tear again.

On top of that i sweat a lot...even when i was 210 lbs I was sweating a lot..mostly my back and my head so my hair gets drenched walking a couple blocks and then my back sweats and it drips down into my boxers and i just gotta wear black cloths or if i sit on my ass theyll be a sweat stain.. its a huge thing in my life and it affects me very much in a lot of situations, lets just say im the only guy at work with a fan and I overheat very easily a lot..even in -20 weather if i walk like 3 blocks ill get home sweaty and im just always like wtf...imagine in +20 weather how bad it can be..I wear the same shirt and cloths almost everyday that dry up quick and are dark colors...

My gf is great she doesnt mind the sweat she is a special girl, im surprised i even have a gf like wtf. altho she has issues similiar to me i can understand how we are in eachothers life still...having a girl in ur life can be great and can also be the shittiest thing ever but once you go there you never can go back to being single.

I don't know im just looking for words of wisdom and advice maybe,..I know i don't have it as bad as some people here.. I have a good family but i avoid them...i don't rly like my dad but hes in my life and my parents divorced when i was 1 year old I think...he cheated on her and tried to fuck with her during my childhood and all kinds of fucked up shit...

Im def stuck in my comfort bubble. All I wanna do is either become an actor ( fuck theyll stop the scene and be like can you not sweat sir during the scene ) or become a rapper/sound designer but that shit involves connecting with people who just never seem interested and everyone wants to do their own thing nowadays and I feel i need a mentor for this so its hard.

I could go on and I feel i can't even explain the real issues in my life in this post.

Any advice/words of wisdom?

"I live with my two cousins (sisters A &amp; B). One cousin I'm cool with, A. I used to live with her and just moved out due to me needing a closer house to my job so now I live with B. I've been struggling with depression most of my life but I hadn't really accepted it. To me I was raised that being depressed or bipolar or whatever is just an excuse and that I should just be normal. I have a habit of just eating everything so B confronts me about it when we go to Wal-Mart. Makes a huge lecture in the car about how ""I'm eating everything and what is wrong with me"". She's not lying so I just start thinking, *is this really how my life is going?* On the drive home, I was quiet and A took notice but dismissed it. This was two days ago.

Earlier at A's house, A and I were in the kitchen and I started talking about how I felt. B was at work. Then the conversation went to me talking about what made me sad. How I feel like I suck the joy out of others. And how I saw a video about how one guy wanted to end it, so he's basically just eating himself to death. I told her that I feel like maybe I'm doing that too.... Eating to fill a void.... I told her how I miss my family (I moved out of my dads house and he's on the other side of the country so I can't just go down the street) and how I just am generally sad, dropping out of college, etc. How eating makes me forget how I feel and I feel at peace. How I'm too scared to actually do anything so I feel like I might just be letting nature take its course. 

Her face scared me. I never have told anyone about how I felt, except for y'all. (I post sometimes.) Her face just looked like I had told her I murdered puppies or something. Part of me hated that I told her, that I was weak. But another part, and the reason I post this, feels free. I feel good that someone knows. I don't feel alone. 

She's gonna help me lose weight and focus on music to try to find something meaningful in life. I feel good. I accept that I do suffer from depression. I was diagnosed before but as I said I didn't take it seriously.

"I got out of the psych ward after a two week stay just a few days ago. They diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder, but I don't know how accurate the diagnosis could be given that I have the tendency to act accordingly to avoid certain diagnosis. My mother keeps trying to label me as a psychopath or sociopath, or a borderline. Mainly because I don't love her, I don't necessarily care about her or my brother. I think about them dying a lot, but I wouldn't kill them or anyone. I just know that I wouldn't particularly be upset if it happened, and that goes for most other members of my family.
I do have feelings for a few of my friends and partners, boyfriends or friends with benefits but I can't picture losing them like I can my parents. Maybe I'm too self absorbed but I really don't know.
My IQ is 108 so I don't think I could be a sociopath given that they usually are much smarter than the average person. A psychopath I don't know either but I really don't want to diagnose myself with anything, I'd hate to label myself as that kind of person.
I used to be a Christian. I was reading an old journal a few days ago, from eighth and ninth grade. I had written out a prayer, angrily question God as to why he allowed me to be born without the capacity to love my family.
I've never been suicidal, or tried to hurt myself past a certain extent. It seems like every emotion I do have is stronger to me than it would be the average person, I don't know why. It's hard for me to empathize with most people.
Based on experience or general knowledge from a third party, what are the possibilities that my mother is right about me? Is this regular teenage angst? I'm nearly seventeen.

"Hi guys,
Never even used reddit before but a close friend of mine suggested asking for help on one of these to keep anonymous.

Recently I've finished school and turned 18 (adulthood in Australia). For about 12 months now I've had massively interrupted sleeping schedules, and my body is used to only getting 4-5 hours sleep, sometimes able to function on 2-3.
In the last 4 weeks, my thoughts tend to become darker, I feel the sensation of suffocation and drowning (I'm crying as I type this..)

I hate the thought of professional help (counsellors/therapists) but I may consider it soon. I have a loving yet dysfunctional family, 2 brothers and loving parents. I live in a good home and have a part time job as a cashier in a supermarket that I've stuck to for 2 years. I'm waiting on university offers and if I'm lucky I'll be moving states to Melbourne City in Victoria for something along the lines of Law/Business.
I can't shake these awful feelings, my brain feels continuously sick. Recently I've been experiencing alot of anxiety, something I've never ever felt before, usually I am confident and outgoing. Very recently, my job has made me feel extremely anxious and sometimes I hyperventilate if I'm lacking sleep and feel like I'm sinking even lower... its 3:10am on New Years Day as I write this.

I don't know how I feel about disclosing what I think triggered this depression, but I will say I received an unexpected diagnosis after collapsing during work about 3-4 weeks ago. It's been downhill ever since.

(M/24/Appalachia)
Been depressed for over a decade now, and every year it's gotten worse. I feel like I am the subject of some cruel joke, a demented Truman Show, just tortured constantly in every aspect of life. Even the simplest tasks that people do, I have problems with. 



I am quite ill and have severe chronic pain (FAPs), but I can't get help because I live in the south and only junkies are allowed pain medicine here now with the new laws, and plus ""I'm too young to be so sick!"". I'm also a student but every year I fail half of my classes due to my illness or my severe crippling anxiety. The exhaustion is constant, and I don't have the mental or physical energy to do anything. I can't work either due to the same issues so I have no income, don't even have a bank account because I can't afford it. What money I do get I spend on cannabis for pain relief and so that I can keep food down (FGID). The pain really is crippling and I'm in tears from it 3+ times a day. I've waited 9 hrs in the ER, and I was still not seen by a doc. That's ""coal country"" for you, raped by corporations and then left to rot (//soapboxing)



I sleep about 3 or 4 nights out of the week (~4 hrs nightly), and have gone 6 days without sleep. Right now I'm on day 2. The sleep is never restful, I wake up about once an hour, the extreme pain creates these violent dreams where I am constantly getting brutally murdered. Takes me at least 3 hours to fall asleep, and I've spent 12+ hours laying awake in bed trying to sleep (I think that's why my joints hurt so bad.)



My psych is useless, he literally won't let me finish a single sentence and constantly berates me. He also refuses to treat me unless I take Paxil (his biggest sponsor) which previously led me to a suicide attempt and almost got me expelled from school (they thought I was on hard drugs). My psych didn't even have record of this suicide attempt even though I told them about it immediately. I've tried all the SSRI's and SNRI's and they all leave me worse than when I came in. I want to keep living and I'm afraid these meds will ensure that I don't. Sadly I can't switch doc's because the state pharmacy board will say I'm Dr. Shopping, being in WV they take it seriously. All of this together makes life like Chinese water torture. Drop by drop, day by day.



That's not even the worst of it, but I'll keep that one to myself for now or else some of you may think suicide *IS* a valid option for me! This event really gives me symptoms of PTSD though, but I don't self diagnose, and it puts a heavy load of regret on me I carry every day. Another deep regret I carry is from this: My good friend left from my house to a planned fight, which ended in my good friend using self defense and shot one of the men who was attacking. My friend just got 10 years for it, and I have so much weight on my heart that if I could have just stopped my friend from leaving he would still be free and this victim would still be alive. I think about it everyday. It really is torture in this poor tiny mountain town. This is as close to a 3rd world country in the US as it gets.

 

Socially I'm just as bad, heavily introverted. College is hell, I go to a small local campus of a bigger uni, meaning the class size is small. Forced participation is a nightmare, and there are no worse words to me than: ""Ok everyone, find a partner"" I end up alone every time. My every cough, every lead pencil broken, every sniff of the nose sends a wave a pure cringe through my body, even though I know it doesn't matter and no one cares. My anxiety gets so bad I have to leave class to puke, yet my psych sees no issues there. I find my self tailing friends at bars and if they leave I'm quietly in the corner awaiting their return. Comedy is my only crutch because physically I'm monstrous and have no self-esteem or confidence, I literally look like I have 2 black eyes ALL THE TIME. Tried all the creams and stuff but it's beyond help I think.



I don't expect anyone to have some magic solution but at this point I'm willing to try just about anything. I don't remember what it's like to be happy, and I'm forgetting what it's like to be human as well. Thanks for listening it really means the world to me.



Positives: I have an apartment w/ no rent, I'm good enough comedian to have a YT channel. Play guitar fairly well. Compassionate and empathetic to the point where it screws me over. Great w/ kids (studying Elementry Ed., no anxiety towards the kids, but if an adult is there too the anxiey is through the roof) I also don't really get social anxiety when streaming on Twitch (unless I've had a little too much ganja) perhaps the the screen being a barrier that blocks some of the anxiety, who knows.


Sorry for the novel, that's adderall for ya.

"Hey. Excuse my incoming rant, I just feel like I have to get a few things off my chest or they will crush me for good and I have never done this before. Also excuse my English - I am prone to not paying attention to the grammar when I get long-winded.

What a year this was. Well, not for me but for pretty much everyone else I know. Success just can't stop coming for them. Pretty much everyone is doing great, even the people about which I used to think that they would end up in my current situation. And then there is me, in all of my useless, depressed self, wallowing in my self-inflicted misery. The only things that were enjoyable to me happened on a macro scale so they didn't really affect my personal actual situation at all.

I'm 24, still living with my parents and lonelier than ever before. I spend most of my days at home, mostly reading and watching useless crap on the internet. I read books too, but not as many as I used to. I've got attention issues. 10 years ago I could tear through a 600 pages long book in a day, today I can barely go for 15 minutes before I feel like I have to do something else (like refreshing a webpage and seeing that nothing has happened) and then have a hard time coming back to whatever I was doing. I can still read fast but I feel like I've become addicted to the ever-avaiable constant stream of shallow information that is so typical for this day and age - I think I know more the American electoral system now than I have ever wanted to know even though I live half a world away. Still, I've read pretty much through the entire Western canon over the last few years, trying to find answers... to anything with nothing coming out of it.

I procrastinate... a lot. It causes issues at the uni where I have been behind on pretty much every deadline I've ever gotten and considering what I've been told about my latest paper I may not even be able to finish it. But the degree I am trying to get is useless anyway (I chose it a few years ago in a bout of depression after I quit my original pursuit of some economics degree), so it probably doesn't matter anyway. The worst thing is that I think that I actually have a good work ethic when I really set my mind to something, but I hardly ever actually get to that point and I have a hard time staying in it because my mind just goes somewhere else. I've tried to write a book - I think I am pretty good with words, at least in my native language, and I thought it would offer me some more opportunities for escapism (that's pretty much the only peace I get these days). I got really excited, spend 3 weeks on it... and yet once I stopped some 30k words in, I have been having a hard time getting back, even though I have the whole thing in my head.

Those two issues are probably aided by thyroid problems. A doc told me two or three years ago that I should see a specialist because my thyroid apparently isn't working exactly as it should. I've ignored that advice and now I fear going to see a doctor because they will shit on me for neglecting the issue. I think it's just an irrational fear of criticism and denial. I know that I should do it and yet I can't bring myself to it. I've been delaying and delaying, always putting it in the ""after that"" spot. I am an idiot. Telling myself that I am an idiot does not really help though.

I've got communication issues too. Had them for a long time. I was bullied a bit at school when I was like 12 but while I thought for a longest time that it didn't affect me (I've become friends with all those people overtime), it probably ended up affecting me more than I thought it would. It certainly put a dent into my school performance, even though that was probably paired with the fact that I did not have learn anything for my first 6-7 years at school because all that stuff was too easy for me and so I never really learned how to learn, if you know what I mean.

The worst thing is that I feel like there is no reason for me to not live a normal life. I am clever... heck, my intelligence is well above average according to everything I have ever been told. I look normal - I think I have a pretty face, pretty green eyes and nice hair and all that. My height ended up average, close to 6 feet, even though my paediatrician has always said I'd turn out 5'5-6 at best. I am bit underweight and have problems putting on weight (thyroid again?), but that's probably the only issue with my appearance. I was surprised to discover that my voice is kinda whiny a few years ago, but I don't think it's that bad.

And yet I feel like I repulse people. I've never had a girlfriend. Those few girls I liked never... really paid attention to me, even though I was nice to them and they were nice to me... I should've probably been more assertive but I've always feared the embarassment of bad social experience. I've pretty much stopped trying over the years. Also, I don't remember any girl ever trying to get me and if any did, I remain completely blind to it to this day. As I said, I've eventually become friends with most people around me but those relationships were always pretty shallow. I've had maybe two really good friends over the last 10 years (mind you, hardly the ""best friend"" category) but even they have been gradually drifting out of my life. I can't really fault them for that as they have their own exciting lives and I have almost nothing to offer in exchange for friendship... they've certainly tried to get me out of my shell (and still do from time to time) and I will remain grateful for that.

Last summer I got a work in a warehouse. Just wanted to make some quick buck and I think manual job suits me because my mind can shut off and go to its own place without any consequences. I did the job well, all eager and active and got on a good raport with some co-workers. And yet after a few weeks they started telling me that there were no hours avaiable for me even though they told me there would be hours for several months when they hired me. Hell, they even hired more people after me and those were still coming to work. I've checked in a few more times after that and all I got were weird faces and evasive answers so I stopped. To this day I don't know what I did wrong. It's a small episode but it's pretty indicative of the rest of my life... I don't know what I did wrong and yet people never really connected with me on a deeper level so I drifted away from them as they did from me.

I should add that my parents fight a lot... have been fighting for 15 years. It's a real wonder that nobody ever got hurt. My mom's got anxiety and a phobia from dirt and diseases so she gets panic attacks basically all the time. It took my dad years to become mindful of that and the relationship has gone really sour over that time. Today they just fight over everything, even the smallest, stupidiest things, like who is going to cook a dinner. That has probably affected me too when it comes to interpersonal relationships... ""is this what I am going to get if I get a girlfriend? That's not worth it.""

I think I am getting to the end of this. I feel like I am missing some things I wanted to say, but I am glad that I've got at least this out of me. Happy New Year and let's hope the things get better.",3,"Those two issues are probably aided by thyroid problems.I should add that my parents fight a lot... have been fighting for 15 years.

"Throwaway because SO knows my username. 

I'm a graduate student in a field I've always wanted to be in, working with a world-renowned adviser; I have a supportive family, am relatively attractive and intelligent, and a great SO. By all accounts should be thrilled with the life I'm living. Obviously I'm not or I wouldn't be posting here. 

My motivation is basically gone, as is my confidence in myself and my passion for the work I'm doing. All I want to do is lie around and watch TV all day, and lately, that's all I've been able to do. My goal yesterday was to make it out of bed before 12 pm. 12 PM!!!! I'm an adult, that's ridiculous! 

I was a vegan for moral reasons for a long time, was a healthy eater, cooked nightly, and was in great shape from tons of yoga and working out. Now, I'm lucky if I do some light stretching and cook once a week.

I can't focus on anything. Trying to get work done is like running uphill in two feet of snow holding a bag of rocks. When I try to concentrate it feels like there is a cloud in my head that information can't get through. It's so frustrating and exhausting and I just can't handle it anymore. 

I've always had obsessive thoughts, and had a bit of OCD as a teenager, but now they're just constant and are affecting every aspect of my life. I know they're not rational, and I know not to let myself get fooled into believing them, but when I'm as vulnerable as I have been lately it's a challenge. 

It's taken me months to accept the fact that I might be depressed and not just a lazy, unmotivated pos, even though that's what I feel like. I've struggled with making excuses for myself and my behavior all my life; my mother rationalizes everything she does and never takes responsibility when she isn't handling things the way she should, and I think I've overcompensated in the wrong direction. This acceptance is a huge, painful step for me but I'm proud of myself for finally getting here. I think I need to accept that I need help and can't combat this alone. This isn't something to be ashamed of, it's something to confront head on and something the great, supportive people in my life can help me with.

I've been really depressed, and today is the same. My friends are having a potluck, but I just want to sleep. Last time I hung out, I didn't feel like I fit in. It takes so much energy to leave the house.

What do I do here? I can barely function. :(

I was taking Adderall and desipramine before, but last term was rough. After school ended, I stopped taking the Adderall, as I noticed that I grew tolerant to it. I'm scared to try another medication. 

I don't really want to go to this potluck, either. I just want to sleep.

"I have so many things that make me feel sad, especially right now, but I don't talk about them with others, even though I have some lovely friends, because I don't want to place the burden of myself upon them. Even though I have no evidence this will happen I am gripped by the fear that they will think I'm annoying (oversharing?) when I think about telling them this stuff, or I start to think about how maybe they will abandon me if they knew how sad I really was. I think that talking about stuff sometimes does make you feel better... just to unload that stuff. But I feel like I'm really making people suffer by telling them and so I end up suffering alone. What do I do??? I honestly need an appointment with my therapist today, but I have to wait till the 3rd and I feel like stuff could burst out of me before then that will alert people to my depression which I don't want. And all this is made worse by the fact that I'm not actually diagnosed. My therapist said it's not pathological what I have, but I feel completely alone in my thoughts and feelings all the time. If the act of me killing myself wouldn't affect people like my family and friends, especially my mom, I would have done it already.",3," I honestly need an appointment with my therapist today, but I have to wait ,And all this is made worse by the fact that I'm not actually diagnosed,My therapist said it's not pathological "
"I was wondering if anyone here ever decided to abruptly end taking their medication, specifically Wellbutrin. Some personal context, I was diagnosed in October of 2015, I had been on a variety of medication up until March of 2016 at which point I settled on Wellbutrin. I have been on 300 mg of Wellbutrin ever since.

I just finished my first semester at college, and over the course of the semester I have had some ups and downs. However, overall the experience has been a net positive. I made some great friends, enjoyed two of my classes, and didn't completely fail my classes.

In the last two months I noticed that my medication was having very little effect. Depression-wise, I have hit a plateau. I wasn't getting better, but I was also not hitting too many lows.

I started occasionally skipping days on taking my medication. Not completely intentionally, I would just put it off to later due to other priorities (studying for finals) and just end up forgetting to take it. I met with a new psychiatrist (from the college) with whom I discussed the feelings of hitting a plateau, and got a prescription bump to 450 mg (I didn't mention that I occasionally skipped days).

In the past couple of days, almost a week at this point, I haven't taken any Wellbutrin at all. I feel just fine.

Since I have had depression for almost year now, I forget what feeling normal is like. I can't tell if I am back to ""normal"" or if my current feelings are the ""new normal"".

I know I should (and probably will) talk to the psychiatrist about this, but I just wanted to hear some anecdotal accounts of anyone who has tried to go cold turkey with Wellbutrin. I would love to get off medication if I could, but I understand that such a rapid transition can be detrimental.",3," wondering if anyone here ever decided to abruptly end taking their medication,was diagnosed in October of 2015,noticed that my medication was having very little effect.

"I have had suicidal thoughts almost every day since I was around nine years old. I have been on a few different types of anti depressants:
Zoloft
Effexor 
Celexa
Trazodone (mostly for sleep but paired with Effexor)

I don't understand why I have these thoughts. I have acted on them in the past and obviously I survived. Sometimes I have them when my mood is really bad and things are really hard. Thoughts are like: it would be easier if I just ended this. I'm tired of living.

Other thoughts happen when I am generally rather happy or even excited. The thoughts are more like: yes this is nice, but life honestly feels so monotonous or pointless. It'd be better if I died. I don't have a purpose here. I get in the way. These people don't actually care about me. I'm too much trouble and I am a burden. They would be a lot happier not having to deal with me. I should just kill myself. It would have been better if I had died last time I tried.

And other times it's very random. Such as when I'm driving. They bother me a lot and I was recently told it wasn't normal to have thoughts like this. I used to think everyone would think things like this from time to time, but I was told that they don't and it disturbed me.

My moods are difficult to handle at times. I feel like I'm all over the place. Sometimes I'm doing very well and feel pretty confident about things. I set goals. But when it crashes, I feel miserable and I quit eating, bathing, and generally just taking care of things. It's like looking through someone else's eyes. Like what I'm doing doesn't matter and I don't know why I'm bothering to do it. 

I haven't ever told anyone the real extent of my suicidal thoughts. No one knows I have them almost daily. When I told an individual I had them, she believed it was only in that moment and a couple of times. 

I wanted some advice. The thoughts scare me. Right now I wouldn't act on them. But I have tried a couple of times- as a teenager and once at 21 that I still don't know how I lived from and thankful I did. I was not hospitalized. Did it alone and stayed alone for about a week afterwards. I don't want to ever find myself at that point again and I think I need to tell somebody, but the thoughts make me feel insane or like a bother. ",3,".

I work at costumer service, I literally has to assume another identity in order to survive that day to day and the stress that comes from attend people directly.

I'm pretty much afraid from almost everyone, I think they are going to do me some damage, I think I has PTSD since I was badly beaten with a metal tube and almost killed in a public place back in 2013. I was OK, but since pretty much like march 2016 i begin with constant attacks of anxiety in the work and in public places, I was constantly alert about my surrounds, six month ago, back to June I have my first anxiety and panic attack on a public event with rich people in where my boyfriend was attend to, he almost broke with me then, I go to 2 therapist but they cant do anything with my case, they don't even know how to diagnose me. 
Again my boyfriend try to broke with me mid September, I almost kill myself, come to a mental institution but neglected being interned, but they gave me medication (Prozac and klonopin). I was with two psychiatrist since then, but they still don't know my diagnosis. I finally have a appointment with a specialist on January 3 to validate and see my case to make a formal diagnosis.

But something happens today on the morning (December 31); my boyfriend want to break with me, now this time seriously, I cried, I scream, I have the worst panic and anxiety attack I ever had, he said that he loves me deeply, but when I was with other people (like friends of him) I change totally, my voice, my manners, my way of speak, walking, acting, thinking, even what I speak of changes totally, the worst of this? I don't have consciousness this happens, I remember been there and all but, didn't notice these changes. My boyfriend hates deeply this ""personality"" I don't know of till today.
We talk and talk, he gives me a second chance (even The fact I don't deserve it, but love him so much I don't want he to go). But now I'm afraid, not only by the anxiety and the depression I am, but too from this ""Personality"" I don't even know.

"Edited: changed some of the wording, and fixed a typo. I wrote this in a hurry.

Hello. The situation is as follows:

I suffer from extreme depression. I have been diagnosed with some OCD symptoms, but other than that, I exhibit no ""abnormal"" traits, and consequently most of my friends do not know that often, I am in a lot of pain.

I went to this school to get away from home, and this decision was supported by my doctors. First year, I ran through some obstacles, but overall, my grades were alright. I made new friends, the dean of engineering supported me (he ended up knowing of my depression), and although both semesters were hard, I would say that I did a good job.

Sophomore year, I also dealt with pain, but I had developed more ways to get rid of it. I had joined the dodgeball club, several intramural teams, and worked on a math conjecture which I later proved, which I was told needed graduate level work. 

I went through a variety of small situations in college, which I will not go into detail. It is universally agreed and seen that I have not made an attempt to hurt anyone or myself, nor have I made a threat to anyone or my own life. No fights, no animosity between me and teachers, nothing. I have spoken of being in a lot of pain, and one response to me disclosing this to professionals, which I now know is controversial, was to encourage me to go to a ward. I kept repeating that I thought it was a bad idea, but I finally gave in, and the result was terrible. I missed my classes, I was in a place where I was not allowed any homework or devices, and I felt separated from my friends. And I came to realize that the school may be playing a game to get me to leave. 

 Although I made many friends that see a happier, kind of smart guy who seems great to hang out with, I sought help with very close friends who were really extraordinary people who support me as I type this. I talked about my depression with these people, and they supported me, and we shared a common goal of me recovering to a much happier, less anxious person. 

One of these friends confided in someone from the staff that she was worried about me. She meant no harm by it, and was possibly optimistic that the person might help. The response, which she forwards back to me was to cut off all communication with me. This is from someone (the faculty member) who knows one thing about me- that I am depressed.

Time goes on, and I make it through freshman year. It was tough, but I know that staying close or at home would slowly break me. 

Fast forwarding through sophomore year, to the end of the first semester. I got sick, which prevents from exercising. I depend on exercise to relieve stress and I am in fantastic shape as a result. Strike 1. Then, because I was sick, I was in too much pain to sleep. So I didn't sleep for a whole night. Strike 2. Then I got drunk. Strike 3.

As I was drunk, I expressed suicidal thoughts. I was crying out for help, saying that I was in a lot of pain. Fast forward after that, since the next information will make the stuff in between not very helpful, and we have the student conduct board determining it was okay for me to go back. They were super kind, and the last call I had with them was very comforting with them. I met with my psychiatrist and told him everything, and he agreed I was ready to go back to school. Things weren't great, but they were easier. I was abused by security guards in the hospital they took me to(whole nuther story) and I was still trying to recover. Friends who were worried about me expressed their hope for my well-being. A teachers were happy when I told them I was allowed to go back, with all of them being very supportive.

It is important to keep in mind that, because of fear of something unfair happening, I keep my depression almost entirely to myself. 

Fast forward to now, I receive a call from the dean of student health and well-being that he wants me to leave. As simple as that. I tell him everything- that my parents think this is a bad idea, that professional opinion thinks its a fucking horrible idea, and that I have been studying hard to make up for the stuff I missed. He doesnt give a shit and insists on the meeting which has the chance to break me. 

Part of me sees this as a formality. He never explicitly stated that I will have to leave, and merely encouraged it at first. He says he will contact a third party evaluator to check on me, and this kind of comforts me cause if this person isn't from the school, I can easily convince him/her that a) I am not going to be in that situation again because I will never drink again b)that leaving the school with my closest friends and losing my courses there will leave me in a terrible state.

I ended up doing research and I learn that these meetings end up being one-sided. I did more research, and I see, given the situation, it violates the Americans with Disabilities Act on so many  levels.

Again, I do not know what they could or will do, and I politely expressed my concern with the dean who called me that I am worried that this meeting is a scam trying to flush me out. Of course I did not use those words. What worries me is that this person will eagerly ignore medical professionals or my reasoning that this was a bad idea to go on with the meeting. He has an extremely small, if any, amount of evidence that shows me as someone who should leave. But I am worried of how corrupt this meeting is.

Can someone please help me? I've been feeling sick after hearing about this. I have gotten a lot of support from friends, which, in written form, plays a role in the meeting. At least 10 people in 2 days have desired to write letters of support. I want to know if the absurdity of this leaves me another option other than crying. I know this is unfair, but the difference about this and, say, a bad referee call, is that this decision threatens my well-being and crushes the little chance I have to recover.",3,"Depression, OCD,engineering, Sophomore year dealt with pain, drunk, suicidal thoughts, hospiatized, abused by security guards,   dean, asked to leave"
"Call it FOMO, jealousy, whatever you wish. I have spent 22/24 hours of each day for the past 12 months at home, in a 10x12 room staring at a fucking computer screen, because I have lost the energy to do anything else. This past year has been absolutely the hardest (outside of when I was hospitalized against my will about 15 years ago, which ended up doing zero good for me, surprise surprise.). I have been to about 12 or so medical professionals, had 3 CTs, 2 xrays, been on 20 different medications, and they can't figure out why I'm sick. They say I don't have cancer, which while horrible would have at least been an answer. It is entirely fucked up, I fully recognize that, but there are days that if a doctor told me I have only a month or so left to live, I'd cry in relief. I've seen specialists who treat me as just another number who got unlucky in life. Unlucky in life, boy, that sure does sum it up though. Abusive family, criminal father, automatic black sheep from birth, poor, redheaded, fat from young age, bullied, sick a LOT, etc etc. Blah fucking blah. At least I'm not hungry, though, right? That's supposed to make you feel better, comparing your misfortune to others'. The problem with that is your experiences are exactly that. You can't help but view your continuing chain of fucking shit problems as well, exactly that, to be rather repetitive. I don't know, I guess I'm ranting. I feel like I'm taking up space. I even thought about what my room would be used as once I'm not around anymore, whatever that ends up meaning. Maybe Mom could convert it into an office. That'd be nice. I do live at home, but at least that's for a good reason I suppose. Those 2 hours I mentioned? That's transporting my elderly grandfather back and forth from his day care program. He has Alzheimer's and Dementia and I keep an eye on him. God knows why they trust me with him. I'm the fucking psychotic asshole, right? I could keel over any minute (hopefully) and then what? I guess he'd go to a nursing home. So I suppose I'm a better choice than those nightmarescapes of fucking places. I don't know. I just want to fade away without harming anyone else, or myself for that matter. I don't -want- to die, but I don't see much of any other option. Not that I'd do it myself, I'm too much of a fucking coward to do it. I guess I'm stuck. Just skip this post, it's a waste of time.

out of the blue she said she might need to stay at work longer for new years, then switched the reason to her friend needed help at the front desk (the friend who asked her to drink), and she stayed there for another 6 hours, hardly messaged me, then sent a confusing message 3 hours ago and she stopped getting my messages since, she would be home by now from work and if her phone died shed charge it, but that makes 8 extra hours of work which is severely unlikely. i really think she drank and that is killing me on the inside

when the clock struck 12 i was alreadt crying and 10 minutes into the new year i cut myself, and now im in full blown panic mode because shes still not responding

she alwaus says she never lies to me, but if she drank tonihjt she broke her promise not to because she said she didnt like it, she crushed my hopes of being with her and i spent new years alone crying, and she completely destroyed my start to the year.

"I really kinda just want to vent a little I guess? I have terrible general and social anxiety that feeds into my depression, and I live a fucking nightmare. I know (because others have told me, however won't say what was said) that people talk about me behind my back. I don't know what they say ever, and I also don't know who does. This is brutal as far as my anxiety goes, and I have a tendency to catastrophize over small things, and it spirals until I'm a dysfunctional mess.

I stayed here for 2 reasons: Transferring schools for senior year would suck, and I value my relationships here a lot, but like I said before my relationships seem to be falling apart.

I talk to 2 different therapists, and I am on 3 different medications for my depression and none of them help.

I was in a relationship from May of two years ago until November of this year, and she broke up with me for what I feel like was a bogus reason.

I've had major depressive episodes since I was 15, with these culminating in a hospital stay at 17. Since then I have tried to live with my depressive tendencies and fight, just putting one foot in front of the other and using medicine to help even me out. This year, I've hit a wall I believe.

Starting in January, I noticed my marriage of 8 years was failing, but I stuffed it back in my mind because I didn't want to admit it. This continued until the end of May when I found out about infidelity and apathy on her part. Afterward, I lost most of my support network, with only my mother and father, one life-long friend, and one 1/2 life long friend remaining to help (I lost my extended family 6 or 7 years ago because of lawsuits arising from a death in the family). There is a lot of hurt on both sides, but at this point in time, I don't feel anger will fix anything. I would rather try to get thru this and let her find what she is looking for somewhere else.

I focused on my health to try to forget the pain and found out from my doctors that I will be lucky to live till 60 because of a complex back problem (kyphosis/stenosis/degenerative disc/degenerative bones/arthritis). I was already on pain meds for these conditions, and hoped for some type of surgery to lessen the pain; I was told I am too messed up to fix. I was also hoping to get off of Lyrica, which caused my weight to balloon to over 300 (I used to be 200-220),

I then focused on a skin condition I have and after a month long process, found out I have Hidradenitis Suppurativa, a condition that is rather depressing all by itself. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidradenitis_suppurativa). Because of its location (my neck), I have to treat it or it can turn into cancer, instantly spreading to my CNS and brain. I have had to start Humira, a drug that weakens your immune response in order to fight the H.S.

After going thru all of this, today I found out my wife canceled my insurance without telling me, possibly hurting my meds and causing problems with my treatments. I had to call her and tell her 1/2 of my medical situation; I don't want to burden her with things that may make her life harder, and have become rather private about my life normally (I feel here I can just talk without being judged, so I am talking about it all now). It was productive and she is going to try to add me back on (we are still married), but I am in store for a fight with the insurance company so I can continue my treatments. She also told me of some problems she has now, and even though I know that she helped create those problems for herself, I feel sad that she is having to go thru them.

I am starting to wonder why I even bother having a positive outlook anymore. I'm truly afraid I am going to die alone (as in single) and possibly before my parents (they are 70 this year). I feel like I have wasted my life, accomplishing nothing and bringing pain to all around me. I'm hoping for a better 2017, but I am not holding my breath.

Thank you for reading, I just needed to get this all out.",3,"Depression ,complex back problems, pain meds, surgery,skin condition, might turn into cancer, insurance policy cancelled by wife"
"Started this new med after failures with Lexapro and Cymbalta. After my primary talked about starting me on this new Med I got concerned and turned to the community for testimonies and different peoples experiences. After cycling off Cymbalta which was hell by the way I've been on trintellix 5mg for 3 days now the side effects are unreal. Nauseous 5 minutes after taking medication until I go to bed 14 hours later mood swings are off the charts I've been more depressed than I have been in the past 6 months and to add to it I am now light-headed and dizzy constantly. And don't get me wrong I understand when starting a new Med I am prone to nausea and mood swings and instability or whatever else you want to call it but I have never been nauseous for 2 days as a side effect and I've never had mood swings comparable to this. My head is always killing me which again common side effect of antidepressants ssris you name it but this is weird. It seems like a disconnect between my brain my head and my body.. I don't know how to explain it other than foggy Maybe.. I've also noticed when I get a spike in Adrenaline,  and then settle back down it seems to hit me all at once.  and coming down from adrenaline on this is not a gentle slope into calmville, its an abrupt atom bomb of whatever chemical it may be and it bottoms me out so far that I've nearly collapsed while working twice. I mostly just wondering if this is a potential side-effect that may go away after chemical levels balanced out or build up, but this is unnatural and I'm not going to be able to stay on this medication any longer if this continues. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar. who knows maybe I'm just all sorts of fucked up and need something closer to a lobotomy.

"To cut the long story short, I've been depressed for 4 years nearly 5.

Meditation daily, different types

Vitamin D and perhaps some other supplements such as omega 3

"I'm a 20 year old guy. I won't rant how bad 2016 was or anything since I go through a bad phase every now and then. Ending the year I entered another one. And I know new year new me is BS but I'm really trying to get my shit together this year and be productive but some things always pull me down. Right now I've cut off every so called friend of mine who was close to me when I started '16 because I kind of hated how less people valued me and how much they used me. But for a start, I feel really good about cutting them off and moving forward even though that means I'm alone, I'm trying to use this time to start appreciating my life more and maybe meet new, less toxic, people. But with all the me time, I tend to think a lot. And most of the thoughts are negative. First off, I kind off hate my body and I can get really conscious about it around people and depressed when I think of it.  Starting from bottom, I am a bit knock kneed that makes my walk different, people keep telling me why I walk like that and the more they say the more conscious I get when I walk towards someone or a group. Having knock knees, I'm really uncomfortable when I wear any kinds of shorts or skinny pants since it's really visible then. After that, I have minor gynecomastia (puffy nipples) which makes my chest look less manly and fat. I can't even take off my shirt without getting uncomfortable af. Then I have a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa. I get lumps under my armpits and groin area . These can be painful and give a bad odour. The lumps can also drain pus and blood which can easily show up on my tshirts or undergarments. I have an overbite which makes my chin looks weak and the whole face unsymmetrical. I also have weird shaped fingers which actually don't hinder anything but people just notice and often make fun of 'em. Hell I cant even go bald if I want to because my head is not even round because how I slept as a baby. 
I have asthma as well and it just wont go away. I've to take my inhaler almost daily. 
Yes I've been hitting gym and people have been complimenting the muscles I have put on but all the problems that I have, they're not fixable (some of them can be fixed by surgery but they're costly) and it kinda depresses me thinking why out of all people, I have all of these things. I've never been happy of my body and I dont know how to cope with it and since I dont have many people to talk to I cant help but think about it over and over again facing the mirror or the other time I'm thinking why people do me dirty and why I can't have strong social bonds. Also the fact that I have achieved nothing in my life so far and have been mediocre at everything I have done doesn't help as well.
All this usually puts me in a bad mood and outweighs all the positive thoughts that I try to bring. I'm really hoping to get this year to be the best one for me but was hoping to get some help with how to deal with all this before I start.",3,"knock knee, wired gait, minor gynecomastia, lumps under armpits and groin area, overbite"
"I'm not visiting a therapist for 10 years and have to take heave medication everyday. I haven't been in a war and had a friend die in my arms. I'm not a homeless, heavy drug addict.

"There are many things that bother me about myself, and those only seemed to have intensified and even multiplied over the past year. I would say all-in-all I will remember 2016 as the years my expectations dropped so low that it has surpassed the depths of cynicism to the point that I feel no different than a (barely) sentient robot. 
2016 is also the year I managed to grow disgusted with the world by the realization that everything in the modern world just seems no different than a movie set, with the plastic wrapping still on and showing. I came to these overwhelming realizations while I've been stoned, and by this virtue I don't know if I can consider these realizations out right depressive symptoms or just moments of supposed clarity in the state of inebreation. All I know is that these moments stick with me through my daily life and have tangibly affected how I feel and act. Maybe I really have been depressed and these high realizations just provided rationalization for why I feel this way, or maybe this is caused directly by the weed. This makes it difficult to know if it is appropriate to make posts on here, as 2016 incidentally was also the year I began smoking pot habitually from the years onset, a habit that I had only picked up towards the end of the previous year and which also strangely correlated with the onset with this feeling of disgust. 
The year 2016 has pushed me into an uncomfortably cushy state of apathy wherein all my ambitions, desires and pleasures have fizzled away. Out of the many undesired changes I've experienced over the year, my apathy has kept me from remembering every detail that I've conceived, but one that really stuck out to me happened last night during an attempt to reconnect with a friend who was visiting my city. He travelled there with his girlfriend with whom he was spending most of his time, and so I barely to catch up with him as a buddy. Whenever he made a comment towards me, I would bypass responding sincerely and just try to go for a smug witty response. This habit has gotten worse over the year, and they're not even as impressive as they once were so it doesn't make people laugh as much to distract them from my impersonability (one of the symptoms I forgot to mention). And since I was resorting to this everytime I was addressed my friend and anyone else I had met there started realizing and ended up talking to me less. I had realized that when doing this it was mostly unintentional and it impeded on my ability to actually connect with these people. It was another red pill realization that I've unintentionally been avoiding personal connection for the past year, and instead I've just been abusing my tendency to replace a two way conversation with a smart-ass remark. Whenever I didn't poorly execute this i had absolutely nothing to say, and so I ended up staying to myself and observing everyone else have fun and enjoy each other's company, while I observed as if through a TV. At some point I started to question whether I was on the autism spectrum, something I hadn't considered before that. 
To end this thought I just want to mention that I hope 2016 has been at worst an anomaly for what should otherwise be a good life for me, and what I mentioned here, though it may just be grazing on the surface of a myriad of issues I had, should be possible to backtrack from and return to my last point when I felt content. But this year I have repeated fond memories from earlier in my life and they felt bleaker and less visceral. I'm hoping that in 2017 I can gain my emotions, humor, joys, ambitions, and personality back because this apathy is torturous. 
I hope what I wrote here is coherent and fits well enough into this sub. Cheers and enjoy your year all

"I suffer from depression in the form of mental exhaustion and lack of energy.

I also get very anxious and have mild OCD.

My anxiety has reduced greatly, sometimes I fixate on and worry about things but it's not constant like before.

My OCD has lessened, but it's still there sadly.

My depression has not lifted, I seem to have a bit more physical energy and motivation but I am still mentally clouded. It's hard to tell if any achievements over this period were due to the meds or my own efforts.

"Hi all,

A friend of mine has gone down a depression spiral over the past year and 1/2. She has seen psychologists and psychiatrists and the only thing they seem to help with is medication. 

She has refused to take the medication properly. She started but stopped after feeling terrible. 

She will make plans and then cancel them because of her panic attacks. They happen daily at specific times, she has one at 7am daily. They will also occur intermittently throughout the day and which point she will be unable to do anything but runaway and be alone, presumably. 

She cannot work, remember things consistently, or think.

She has attempted to jump out of a moving vehicle.

Friends and family have all come to her aid but she essentially refuses any kind of answer because they do not solve her issues. I'm not sure there is a correct answer. 

The biggest source of sadness for her is her age, coupled with where she is in life. She has spent the past 4 years in a masters program for biology that most likely will not amount to a job. She feels as if she wasted her time and will have nothing to show for it. 

I have suggested changing fields but she doesn't have the financial resources to do so comfortably. She is also engaged and doesnt not feel comfortable relying on her fiance for money.

She doesn't make a lot of money, so paying for therapy isn't an option, really. 

I'm just a friend, but I feel helpless that I cannot help her. She has attempted to hurt herself, so I want to do whatever I can or at least be helpful in some way.

"A Sinus Infection Ruined my Life. 

Dude. Itâs Fucked. 

I wasnât supposed to be like the way I am.

I changed a few details to protect anonymity. If you need to match me with a name, feel free to know me as Mitchell. 

I had it all: the grades, the friends, the talentâ¦ I had it all. 

I was the best at everything I did. I was that guy you hated. I was him. 

Then I had a sinus infection. My life was fucked over by a sinus infection. I wish I was joking. 

Well, I didnât exactly know I had a sinus infection. The doctors didnât know either:

I vomited multiple times a day; I suffered from extensive head aches; I felt broken because no one knew what was wrong. 

I saw gastroenterologists because of the vomiting. They couldnât figure it out.

I saw allergists because they thought I had allergies. They were wrong.

I saw countless other doctors. 

I then saw a neurologist (God bless). I had an MRI and a CT.

Just that alone was enough to ruin me (I knew that they were looking for tumors). 

Because of the scans, we found a sphenoid sinus infection. I know this is a strong thing to say, but I wish it was a tumor; it would have been easier. 

They gave me super strong antibiotics (without probioticsâ¦ :c). Basically, in short, the antibiotics fucked over my digestive system and created very fun trips to the potty. It lasted for a while. One complication over another. My body was compromised and malnourished. I was getting close to looking like a skeleton (I just read over everything I have written so far, and realized I missed a ton of things. Letâs just say it ended up a lot worse than how I described it).

This all happened over a period of 323 days (I started counting at day 3). 

I attempted to step back into school and failed miserably. I now had social anxiety because of a few obvious reasons. 

I lost my hobbies, my friends, my girlfriend, and myself.

Overtime, the anxiety led to me learning and âdoing schoolâ from home. 

Being socially isolated led to depression. 

Seriously, the tumor would have been better.

Letâs skip through the nasties of depression (this is a subreddit about depression, Iâm sure we donât need a review). 

I came out the other side of the long and dark tunnel into another long and dark tunnel. I had treatment resistant depression (Iâve seen multiple psychotherapists and tried almost every type of cocktail they could throw at me). 

I continued finishing up my high school career with a clouded mind. I was depressed all the time (anxiety gone, thank god). I couldnât focus on anything. I had no energy to do anything.

Letâs hop to the last two months.

I asked for adderall to just help me focus on my school work so I could just keep moving on (until I figured out how I wanted to end things with myself).

Adderallâ¦ ADHDâ¦? Nope! Adderall = Treatment resistant depression!

No joke. The adderall gave me energy. It gave me life. It helped my focus on what is ahead of me. It gave me the urge to go be me. I started to become -excited- about going out of my house and doing homework. 

This is where I am now. 

Iâm doing homework. Iâm talking to people. Iâm being what I think I am supposed to be. Wellâ¦ when I canâ¦ :c

Adderall is my antidepressant. Itâs the only thing that works. Even with XR Adderallâ¦ it only lasts for about 5 hours. I am only allowed to take two a day (insurance blows now). 

So, I only get about 9 hours a day to beâ¦ well me. Happy, energetic, and beautiful. Then I start to fall down the abyss that we all know. Some nights I fall deep. Some nights it's only a few feet. 

Iâm not really happy me because happy me isnât sad half of the day. 

Iâm cheating depression. Itâs always there and I donât give it the respect that it deserves. It doesnât respect me.

I have a feeling this will be the rest of my life. 

I'm lost now.

I stopped weighing myself about 2 months ago because it was getting even more depressing. I've read a few forums and have noticed that most people have experienced rapid weight gain with this medication, and no matter how hard they've worked- the weight wont budge. same issue here. I'm ready to ditch this medication because 1. I'm sick of dealing with the weight gain, going to the gym 3-6 times a week has done nothing. 2. it seems to increase my anxiety at times. 3.Its expensive(even with a coupon code and insurance.) The thing is- I'm VERY scared as I know that depression can become harder to treat over time. I tried probably about 8 medications before I found this one- I really thought there was no hope beforehand. I've stuck it out because obviously mental health is more important that weight gain, but the weight gain is causing me to obsess over what I eat/how often I workout.

Eventually I (stupidly) weaned off it,  thinking I was ""cured"" and went for about 2 ish years not on any meds.   Eventually I predictably fell back into my depression. 

Went back to the doctor.   We tried celexa again-   didn't work.   wasn't anything like the first time.   then put me on wellbutrin-  didn't really work either.    then we finally tried effexor-  same deal,  didn't notice any positive changes. 
I don't exactly remember but I believe we also tried upping the dosages of these meds also.

"Itâs been almost a month now of consistent terrible break outs, and I donât know how much more I can take on myself. I look in the mirror and feel absolutely disgusted with what I see. I dread waking up in the mornings as I can feel a new pimple or bump on my face that wasnât there when I went to sleep. I have lost myself to acne completely, and itâs ruining my life. I take a shower, and donât want the mirror to show how inflamed and disgusting my face is. I just want a normal face color. Iâm tired of browsing routines, regimes, diets, medications, products, birth controls because it all feels helpless. I just feel as though I am a lost cause. Acne isnât the problem making me depressed, itâs my reaction to it. I can hardly remember a time when I felt confident without a full face of foundation. I feel as though Iâm fighting a losing battle everyday as I will take it and tell myself it doesnât matter, but the majority of the day itâs all I think about. Iâve become obsessed with it, because I want it to be gone. It makes me feel âunhealthyâ and unattractive. I think when people see it, they think there is something wrong â making me ugly.

 As much as I love my boyfriend, and I know how much he loves me, I canât help but letting this skin disease and my mind tell me Iâm not worthy of him because of it. He should be with a girl who has a flawless face, who doesnât go to sleep with spot treatments on her face, and wakes up crying about a new cyst that formed overnight. He deserves to wake up to someone who can roll over and smile confidently at him knowing that she isnât covered in disgusting cysts and pimples. He should have a girlfriend that doesnât have breakdowns about how I feel, and how disgusting I look; essentially having to talk me down all the time. Itâs a burden and itâs annoying, he should not have to deal with it. I don't want to tell him or anyone how I feel, because no one should have to deal with a depressed person; he should have a fun, outgoing person. (The person I was before acne took over my life) It makes me feel unworthy of having children, They would deserve a mother who doesnât hate the way she looks and feels depressed because of it. How could I possibly have children when I feel and look like this? I feel like my nephew deserves an aunt who doesnât let these things affect her, a better aunt than I am. I even feel as though I donât deserve my dog, she is so good and pure and Iâm so depressed and self-hating. My dog makes me so happy, but I even feel unworthy of her love.  I am starting to hate myself, which I really had never done before. 

I know people say it doesnât define you, but Iâm letting it define me. I know people they donât care about it, but they have to. Itâs become severe, and I canât do anything currently to stop it. Iâve sunken into a deeper depression every day, Iâm having a hard time enjoying myself with anything anymore because of how profoundly unhappy this makes me. I know itâs something internal, but what more could I do. I feel as though Iâve tried everything except Accutane, which is going to happen at the end of this month due to the waiting period. I was told all hormonal birth control essentially balances your hormones, so I donât know if the birth control Iâve been on for 5 years is hurting or helping; but Iâve had acne before starting it. I tried Spiro, which caused more and more breakouts for 8 weeks.. Iâve been on antibiotics for 6 years or so, and they have finally stopped working. Iâm happy to start Accutane, maybe it will give me a new lease on life. Or maybe I will be back where I started. I canât take this anymore, every day I feel closer and closer to the ledge.. I know this sounds dramatic, but I cry about this all day and night and think about it 24/7. Itâs driving me insane. Iâve tried to distract myself, but Iâve had a hard time doing that lately. 

I wasn't sure what sub to post this on. I guess I just needed to say something to anyone.

"And how utterly afraid I am. I suck at college. I am absolutely terrible at it. I just cannot seem to pull my head out of my ass when it counts. I am so unmotivated, not to mention tired. So damn tired. All the time. 

A lot of my worth is based on grades. When I was in school I would push myself too hard. After my anorexia calmed down a bit, so did my motivation to do schoolwork. Or anything. Without my eating disorder.

Ever since my eating disorder has been ""cured"" (and by that I mean calmed down to point where it's manageable enough that I don't have the constant need for exercise or racing thoughts over food and such) it's also had another impact: My motivation. I've noticed this ever since my anorexia really left me, my motivation is shot. I can't do college not because I don't have the mind or the resources but because I am simply not motivated enough to do anything. Before this, my anorexia and school work were tied together tightly and when I was in my funk but not so malnourished to function, my productivity would soar because it made me perfectionistic. Now, with that gone, I just can't find that motivation anymore.

But it doesn't just stop at school work. I am so tired lately. So incredibly tired. When I had my eating disorder I felt like I could lift mountains (until the wall hit of course) but now it's all I can do not to be asleep all of the time. It's why I don't go out much. Just getting out of my bed is harder than you can imagine. All I seem to ever want to do is sleep. I wake up and for and hour I'm all good, but after that it's a nap. And then 2 hours of wake and then I sleep the rest of the night. Luckily I don't have nightmares as I nap, only when I go for the long haul.

With the death of my anorexia (and to my shame I admit to trying to revive it several times) I have also lost my motivation and my spark it seems. Maybe it was because the only thing holding the haunting thoughts of trauma was my anorexia, and without that they are just free to take root in my mind and they very much do. The world is a much darker place. At least my anroexia had some sort of spark to it, as dark that flame was. Now I don't even have that.

Everything is just dark now. I have no motivation. No will. The only thing I seem to be able to bring myself to do is nap to avoid my pain. I'm honestly not sure what to do. I killed a enemy only to find it was merely the tail of a larger and more poisonous snake. 

Imagine seeing everything in back and white. That's pretty much how I see the world now. No more colors, no more fun shades. Just black and white. I'm more depressed now than I've ever been and no one is the wiser. I am so good at hiding it that no one sees anymore.",3,"eating disorder, anaorexia, lack of motivation, just want to sleep"
"Man lets see some of my highlights: 

-Started the year of doing lines of yack and smoking weed with people I thought would be my life long friends and overall brothers after all we had done and shared together.

-Met a beautiful girl online who I fell in love with. She was a first for me. Had a great amazing relationship at first but eventually our differences became too great and my depression mixed with her whole nonesense and bs kinda led to our on and off thing and us ultimately breaking up in september for good. I was devastated and depressed as fuck for a long time. For some reason checked her ig a while back and saw she moved on fairly quick and she's happier which kind of kills me inside a bit but overall at this point I'm happy for her and hope she finds what she's looking for.

-Almost didn't graduate cause I was too caught up in slacking off doing drugs and bumming out with ""friends"". But after a shit ton of detention (a grand total of 149 hours lol) I managed to get my shit together. My teacher Mrs. Nelson cried because of my actions and ultimately made me take school more seriously at the end and may just be the reason I graduated, Thank you Mrs. Nelson and I'm sorry i let my issues prevent us from having a really good relationship.

-Got sued cause of a stupid accident by a scam artist, but my insurance company handled it so I guess it wasn't to bad just really stressful.

-Tried killing myself a few times. One time I emptied a tank of gas on myself and almost lit myself on fire but the cops came and I was taken away to a psych ward. Met some crazy motherfuckers there but learned alot about myself. Once I got out of that place I needed a job after quiting my last one so I started pushing. That lasted a short while before I got my act together.

-Started college and went for a month before dropping out. 

-Got arrested after my dad called the cops on me after I hit a wall with some plyers lol. He stretched the truth a shit ton Got charged with felonies and now I'm facing jail time. Been going to anger management and rehab and now I'm starting to face and handle issues better than I would in years past. 

-I was homeless for a while. This taught me the importance of money, homes, and life. Being out in 20 degree weather without much to your name can make you want to bust your ass off harder than you ever could have thought imaginable. 

-Tried to jump off a bridge a few weeks after my arrest. Got stopped by the cops. I was drunk and called my friends because Idk i wasn't good mentally. I was tired, sad, depressed and just overall unable to continue with life at the point I was in life. Lost alot if not all of my friends at the time. About 80 percent of them actually. We still say hello and talk from time to time but its not like it used to be. Can't say I blame them. 

Now moving into 2017 I just want to get back to living a life of normal day to day monotony with its perks here and there. I want to get a car and pursue my passion of automotive engineering and working on cars. I don't care about the bullshit as much and I'm just ready to move on.

They got really upset and started telling me how selfish that is, and they're right.  I knew they've both dealt with suicidal thoughts before, and it was insensitive to bring it up around them.  Since then they stopped talking to me.  I've never felt worse about myself and dealing with it alone isn't helping.  At this point I'm ready to die.  I'm failing out of school, I can't start a relationship, my autism is getting worse, and I won't even have a place to live next month when I turn 18.

Just a week or 2 ago I started feeling very aggravated with people who were struggling with life. I'd compare their problems to mine and think ""everyone is so weak Try living my life"" Now, my whole life I've been the most sensitive person I've ever met. I always felt proud of my unconditional, tireless compassion. But, my whole life I've always gotten my feelings hurt so easily and I spent wayyy to much time people pleasing and trying to get everyone to like me. As I said, lately I feel nothing for the less fortunate. If I notice say, someone being nasty at work to me, I observe it but give it zero other thoughts. I've been dating and I have no intentions for anything but sex. I have no close or bonding feelings with these men. So I actually like this feeling of self-reliance. To not be such a people pleaser has made my life a lot easier. What gets me nervous is my impulsiveness. I keep doing things to see if I'll get caught, or hurt or arrested. Like, I'm a waitress and a customer was slightly snappy with me. No big deal. I decided to spit in his drink so if he continued to be rude I could have a good laugh about it. 2 men I've slept with have girlfriends and to this day we still text/hookup and I could care less for the girl whose relationship I'm invading. I don't even try to rationalize this behavior. I just have no concern whatsoever about how others feel. I drive very fast, all the time. Recklessly and aggressively too. If I think I can definitely get away with it I'll steal and feel nothing, no guilt. If you read this and can't get past the ""sleeeping with taken men"" or are horrified I'd spit in food, I already know it's despicable, I just don't care. If you wanna reply with some useful insight or personal experience with this please go right ahead. If you wanna just bash my shitty actions go right ahead too. I'm just seriously wondering if anyone's ever become temporarily sociopathic and will my concern for others come back? I don't want them too. It's very fun doing whatever I want.

"Hi.
So, um... I'll just write shit down how it is in my head. I've had a lot of bad things happen to me and when I've sought help to deal with mental issues I've been told that in cases such as mine most people have either committed suicide, on heavy drugs or are in prison. I'll admit I've had my moments and I've done some crazy shit since I've been around 5 or 6 and I'm now 30. I am now on a heavy dose of antidepressants which I have realised does not stop you feeling depressed but helps you deal and manage it. It has definitely helped with my anxiety though. I've kind of thought that because I'm such an odd character and quite misunderstood that I would start finding ways to help myself and I've done this by excessively focusing on certain things. I've focussed on fitness and weight lifting I also enjoy gaming and streaming which has also helped with my anxiety. Don't get me wrong, there are days I wish I could clean the whole fucking house and not lay in bed wanting to destroy myself... they're are days where my mind and focus is a bit off and sometimes even way off but I can say these days it's a lot better than it used to be. It used to be waking up not knowing whether or not I was going to die or other people around were going to feel safe. Having been getting better with my anxiety I have now made new friends, talking does not bother me and I'm more relaxed I've even flirted with a girl which was nice. I do have another issue I would love to fix, I have a stutter which I've pretty much had forever. But you know what, I don't even care at all. Fuck it.
My advice to people in that state where they just want to die is, well think about this you're going to die eventually so may as well wait until it happens naturally or I guess unexpectedly. I know what you're saying, the pain of living is too much. I know. I've been through in order of age and events: hallucinations and hearing things along with nightmares from age 2 until about 11 then I was sexually abused, beaten by a drunk father almost weekly and I was bullied pretty much every day of my life until I finished school. My mother was abusive, her boyfriend was abusive, I lost my sister to mental illness she's not dead just lost. My son died (dog) I lost my job then my girlfriend of 9 years then my house then my mind my souls and my humanity. Getting everything back to stable was hard. I tried killing myself many times, well I planned it many times and I don't know how I never actually did it. My girlfriend at the time was also pushing me and provoking me knowing I was trying to kill myself. I can go into a lot more detail but it's a long story and there are many other shitty things I've gone through but you know what. Here I am! I'm alive and I've been through that and more so I feel that I win!! I conquered all that and I still smile, I laugh and I enjoy things. We're all bigger and better than the things that have hurt us, talk about things so that you can show it that it doesn't own you, that it doesn't hurt you and that it has no power! All the things you're afraid to do, do it! Unless it's kill yourself don't do that because you, each and everyone of you deserves to live no matter what you've done and what mistakes you've made! This is life and no one gets out alive so live it up and love! 

Peace out brother and sisters!!

"Alright, here's the deal; I haven't slept in about twenty two hours and my mother is blaring the TV whilst my sisters are screaming, so I'll just say that this may end up being despicably sloppily written, and pathetically long. 

Okay, so now that that's out of the way, I'll get into what it is that brings me here.

In the summer of 2016 I met somebody who quite honestly, as cliched as it sounds, changed my life, and enlightened my soul with new experiences and knowledge and a love too deep, too overbearing for a lone human to take without an excruciating pain present in an almost constant cycle. 

Just saying, I'm a trans dude, in love with a dude, who also likes dudes (in fact, he was the one who helped me figure out my sexuality and supported me more than anyone else regarding my gender identity). Except he doesn't have romantic feelings towards me. Lovely, ain't it?

Anyway, ever since the very first phrases uttered to each other, there was a connection. Heck, I felt that connection when I first laid eyes upon him. No, I'm not talking about love at first sight, but I am certain there was an excitement, an understanding, you know? And I'm pretty sure he felt that connection too.

And that connection was ignited like a fire which fed off of the act of fooling, the act of making the sweet and the ripe believe it was eternal. Less poetically put, when he he started talking to me less and less, when his vibe held this sort of apathy, I was very much so disheartened and in complete disbelief. More accurately, I still am. 

And I blame myself. I blame myself because of my various mental illnesses, and my annoying, whiny and pathetic behaviour whilst he put so much, so so much into helping me out. He gave me advice, he stayed up all night to talk me out of suicide, he did everything in his power to convince me that I wasn't some useless loser. And he genuinely thought that. He genuinely cared. He genuinely thought I was an amazing human being. And frankly, if it weren't for him, there is a great chance that I'd be dead by now. Yes, okay, I've tried killing myself multiple times over the course of our friendship, however each and every time I failed, and holy hell was he glad I failed.

I mean, that's obviously not the only thing we spoke about. Of course not. We have everything in common. Jesus, we even have the same favourite colours. I am not religious or spiritual or whatever, but this? This guy, this friendship, it's simply too much of a miracle for it to be over now. Cause, you know, we've drifted apart (for the record, he knows I'm totally into him, but that isn't what changed things).

Honestly, I've never had friendsâlike, seriously, I've never had real friendsâbut this guy, and when somebody introduces you to something new like this? When somebody finally makes you feel like you matter? Yeah, that's pretty darn difficult to just let go of.

My problem is, we haven't really spoken about my ""issues"" in a while, and I'm seriously just one big mess. I tried to kill myself the other night, and though I don't think I plan on trying again any time soon, I am completely lost and I have no one. No one. Therapists and all that just don't work in my situation, and honestly, I just need him. As a friend. As someone who's there for me.

Except I don't want to annoy him. I don't want to be a burden. I don't want to make him feel bad, and any harsh feelings he may have towards me? Yeah, I deserve that, and I accept all of it. But I just don't know what to do. Would I be a complete and utter idiot if I texted him?",3,"met somebody, changed my life,  trans dude, gender identity, drifted apart,  dont want to annoy"

TL/DR: Severe depression, feeling guilty towards my fiancÃ© for dragging him down with me. Don't know what to do :'(


I am having a really tough time. I have been depressed for many years. I have always been insecure about my body (am overweight), bullied at school, not many friends, but I have been OK for the most part with a caring family for support. But after a couple of years of infertility and after a miscarriage of twins four years ago I developed a more severe depression and anxiety. I have been on SSRIs since the diagnosis witch seem to lower the anxiety but had not done much for my depression.

Lately I have been dealing with intense stress at work coupled with a decision to start trying to get pregnant again. This seem to have put my feelings in overdrive. I have been experiencing extreme anxiety ""attacks"" with several hours of crying without being able to stop. 

I was recently asked to think about when I last felt happy. I know when it was, it was when I found out I was pregnant over four years ago. 
Since after the miscarriage I can't think of a single moment that I have felt truly happy. I can't even remember how that feels like. In know that no one can be happy all the time, that's not how life works. But even when stuff goes my way, like when I proposed to my boyfriend or when I got my doctoral degree, I've not been happy. Glad, yes, but not happy if that makes any sense. 

I feel empty, miserable, like a waste of space and resources. I feel like people are wasting time when they are with me. I feel guilty all the time for bringing people around me down with me, especially my fiancÃ©.   When he asks me how I feel, I most often lie and say I'm ok. And he knows that I'm lying since he knows me all to well. When i do tell him exactly how I feel, he becomes sad and helpless. He says that he wants me to be honest, but when I am he can't handle it. He tries to fix stuff, like giving me phone numbers to helplines, websites with information, etc, when all I need is a shoulder to cry on and someone to agree worth me that life sucks. And yes, I have told him that that is what I need, and he tries. But he feels so uncomfortable when I cry and just sits there miserable while I feel guilty. 

I really really love him and we have been together for almost 10 years, but I feel that I'm wasting his time by being with him. He says that he loves me and I believe him, but love isn't everything. What comfort is love when every day I make him feel miserable just because I can't feel happiness? I also have zero sex drive. He wants to have sex every day, but itv happens only about once a month. Kissing and touching makes me feel really uneasy, but I pretend to enjoy it. Mostly it's OK, but sometimes I feel violated afterwards. I haven't told him this, I can't do that to him. We have discussed going to couples/sex therapy but I really don't want to tell him the truth since I know how much he will be hurt by it. 

I really don't know what to do. My insurance doesn't cover a psychologist/psychiatrist only a counselor. I have been to therapy with that counselor several times before and she made me feel even worse and that my misery was my own fault since I was so negative. She was one of those just-people (""just"" get over it / if you ""just"" think positive things will change / ""just"" stop feeling depressed).

I don't really know what I want to achieve with this post. Just needed to vent a bit. I hope that my doctor has something that can help me tomorrow.

If anyone had read this far, thanks for ""listening"".

"I had a week off over Christmas. My family is all overseas so I was not busy or rushed. I took things easy and slow and didn't do much. It really alleviated the pressures of life and did help my depression a bit.

Now that I'm back at work I feel incredibly depressed - way more than before. I had a taste of feeling relaxed but crashed to the ground.

I need time off to just sort out what I want to do in life, but at work during the week it's all rush rush rush and stress and chores and anxiety. At the end of the day I am just exhausted and do need to sleep or rest.

"So this happened a while ago and is pretty much in the past, but I went through some sort of drug induced psychosis or something. I don't know what happened but I went from half a year or so of doing nothing with my life and having no prospects, to utter ecstasy, in 45 minutes one night, the amount of time it takes for MDMA to kick in. I felt like I was the second coming of Jesus Christ, for a week, a month after, I don't know. Some sort of headspace where I thought I was the one with the ideas to save humanity. Depression to ectsasy in under an hour. I remember I had this thought ""repression of expression turns depression into aggression"", I'll get to why.

But shortly thereafter (in the days following the ""comedown"" of the MDMA but I didn't really come down, more like drug induced psychosis) I was having panic attacks and couldn't function and thought I was going to die sometimes for whatever reason. Just paranoia or whatever... very real paranoia, but just that, nothing more. It's sort of a blur looking back on it I don't remember the exact sequence of events. But eventually after ending up in the mental hospital emergency so many times they just said ""this time, you can't leave. You have 2 choices: voluntary or involuntary patient"". So I spent a night there... and that was it I didn't know how long I was going to be there. It gives a new perspective on life and how long it takes for you to start scoping out an escape route. Let's call it real life escape from Cidna mines in skyrim. It wasn't that bad though you know, comfortable beds, nice people, decent food. But there was an irony of me sitting across a table from a man scribbling ""BUZZ LIGHTYEAR"" in crayon all over a page and me scribbling circuit schematics for voltage dividers to try and explain to the nurses I was sane so they could let me out. I didn't need to plot an escape route though because I was released the next day. But for whatever reason, when I got home, this huge wave of depression hit me.... maybe it was just the rapid change of environment.... freedom, no freedom, freedom. What the hell am I supposed to do, that was the thought that came to my head... what does society want of me? To cure my diseased mind, or to put my unique mind to creative work? I didn't eat anything and just slept and then the next morning had some sort of panic attack or whatever and next thing I know I'm outside just screaming at nothing. I was hungry and thirsty and just wanted some fucking food and here are all these houses and I knocked on a door just to see if someone was there to help me but no. What a sick fucking society we live in, me with not enough water to get up over the hill (I was down in elevation maybe 100 feet, that's a big hill when you haven't eaten or drank anything and are depressed and don't have the energy to get up the hill). Yet here are dozens or maybe hundreds of houses all with water pipes in them and I can't have any. I was screaming ""GIVE ME SOME FUCKING WATER"" but of course no response. I finally just stood in the road and forced a guy in a truck to stop and I asked for his phone, and to prove to him I wasn't a thief I threw my shoe in his truck so that I'd be disadvantaged if I were to run away with his iphone. Just the fact that he gave me his waterbottle (the spontaneous social camaraderie) and the water got me up the first 50 feet or so back home. Then I just lied in the ditch because I didn't have the energy to get back up over the hill. A few cars drove by until a woman finally stopped, but (understandably looking back at it now) she drove by slowly with the doors locked and that she was of no real help (she offered some help but from a distance, not with the metaphorical open arms of the pickup truck guy) and considered me a criminal so I just yelled at her ""go the fuck to work"" or something really nasty and she drove off. But the fact that she had stopped at all gave me the energy... social comradery or whatever at least helped me find the energy to get back home.

Anyways the point of all that was that I couldn't function after that MDMA roll. I can function now, at least. But all my life I've had this anxiety of not being able to express myself in public speaking. Which is ironic because I've played music on stage in front of so many people. But I just have this fear of expressing myself, and when the fear finally burst and I spoke my mind, I lost my freedom, they put me in a mental hospital. So you can't blame me that I'm not too keen to really speak out in front of people that much... at all. I'm a smart guy, I have an engineering degree, I could design and build a computer from scratch given enough time and resources, but I just can't do the social thing. I mean in school or university they don't mind so much the creative or different ways of thinking but the mental hospital, society in general, considered me diseased. I don't relate to people that much. I haven't been on a date for almost a decade... and even back in highschool I never really connected with the girl I dated. I don't know if I did it to myself or if I'm a byproduct of the north american k-12 ""education"" system.

I just need to be able to relate to people. I can't do that and it's slowly killing me. I don't know what to do. I'm happy, but depression isn't happiness or sadness and although I've been given the same result, ""mildly/not depressed"", by different doctors, there is disorder there somewhere and I don't know how to turn it into just normal people order.",3,"drug induced, MDMA, panic attacks, real paranoia,  admitted to hospital, need to relate to people"

I wanted to see if anybody here had success with cutting back on alcohol consumption, and could potentially talk a little about how it helped them manage their depression. I drink too much. I know it's not good for me (in more ways than one, IBS, depression, anxiety). But I have a really hard time stopping. When I do go for periods without drinking, I think I feel better. So I guess I just wanted to maybe hear from some people who successfully either cut back or cut down altogether, and how this has affected them. Also, if you have any tips, it'd be greatly appreciated. I almost feel like I'm addicted at this point.

I believe I was headed to a pizza place which is miles and miles away. I've never actually put that into words, but I am now realising stupid that is. I have no idea why I was going to there. I either wanted to end it or run away, but again, it's fuzzy.

"A big issue I have with my depression is my inability to keep my house clean. I have lived in clean homes my entire life. I know how to clean and keep things clean. When I am a guest at a hotel or a friend's house I clean up and keep my space tidy. My house is a completely different matter. I have learned that it is because of my depression that my house is like this. I live alone and so it is up to me, alone, to keep my house clean.

For the new year I want to make the resolution to clean my house and make it organized and keep it that way. I recently started taking Zoloft and I've noticed that I'm able to keep things picked up. For example I take my used dish and put it in the sink (I have a pile of dishes to do so we're just going to focus on the fact that I took the dish down in the first place instead of keeping it in my room).

I get overwhelmed when I have to clean a lot. Partly because my grandparents were so completely anal about cleaning that it's almost my little rebellion.

"I am 23 year old guy and for the past while I have felt totally lost and hopeless. I can't remember the last time I was truly happy, and most days I think that I will never be happy again. Hating my life has become a usual thing for me and thoughts of killing myself are very frequently occurring now. Just want to vent a little and see if anyone has any advice at all for me. 

Social anxiety/generalized anxiety has affected my life for as long as I can remember. Self-confidence has always been an issue and has been a barrier in making friends/maintaining the few friendships I do manage to make. I have had periods in my life where I have had a close group of friends to spend time with but I never seem to be able to make lasting friendships. Most of those friends have gone on to make other meaningful relationships in their lives and I was not able to continue being a part of it with them.  On top of this, my family is currently pressuring me to find a girlfriend and get married but since I have not had any relationship with a woman in the past, I have no idea what to do and this is now adding to my anxiety (they tried to introduce me to some girls but I blew all of the chances from lack of experience). I constantly worry about the fact that I am a virgin and no woman is ever going to want me because of it and I also have issues with self-image (hate looking in the mirror sometimes). The loneliness turned me on to porn a long time ago and now I think I have an addiction; I am ashamed of this and feel hopeless because I can never talk to anyone about it out of embarrassment.  
Even for the less embarrassing problems, the 2 members of my immediate family are dealing with a lot of stressful problems of their own and I don't want to continue burdening them with my issues. 

Also, I am currently enrolled in a university program that requires a lot of social interaction when the only thing I feel like doing most days is isolating myself and staying in bed. I feel like the weird guy in my class because I just don't have the energy to socialize and make small talk and even when I do, my anxiety makes it so that I babble on like a fool. It is getting to the point where I am making excuses to explain my absences and I am afraid I am going to fail out of the program or succumb to the immense pressure by doing something irreversible. 

Basically, I hate myself and I just wish I could escape from being me for a while. Getting out of bed is becoming more and more of a chore everyday and I feel sad, ashamed, hopeless, and tired. I am pretty sure I am depressed but with my intense school program I just don't have the time to address my issues. Anyway, if anyone read my rant and has any advice it would be greatly appreciated.

"Hello everyone.

I've never actually reached out about my wellbeing before and don't really know how to, so I guess I'm just going to lay it all out on the table.

I'm 24 and I graduated college about three weeks ago, and I think there may be some thing or things wrong with me that I was ignoring as I gritted my teeth through my generally painful and unrewarding five-and-a-half year college experience. To keep things abbreviated, all I'll say here is that during that short time I had three major medical catastrophes (one of which will persist for the rest of my life), I was stalked for 7 months at one point, lived with an abusive couple, and had several family deaths. All of these negative stimuli gave me the opportunity to hand-wave my mental health difficulties as par for the course. It almost goes without saying, but my GPA was decimated by these experiences (my college has a terrible medical withdrawal system and as a result I have never taken any medical leave).

I would say I was ""doing well"" during my last two semesters (although my definition of doing well still involves a constant fog of anxiety and sleep issues); I was pursuing my interests relatively aggressively, making probably a B+ average in my classes, exercising 3x/week (this stopped a couple months ago), etc. During my final semester I was even working two part time jobs while taking classes. I still had these constant discomforts that I chalked up to school and proximity to recent hardship, but now after a few weeks of unemployment and no school I'm starting to think I'm incapable of enjoying myself in a healthy way (or at all really).

I have diagnosed ADHD and have always struggled in school, but in the last three years have really had to teach myself how to learn and devote myself to my studies. As a result I have learned a lot, but I also have lost a lot of my sense of identity. I haven't had a girlfriend since I was 17, and have only been on one date in the intervening time. Additionally I have dropped essentially all of my hobbies, and my latent avoidant behaviors that have always subverted all of my efforts have become more and more disruptive. For instance, just tonight (it's 3:30AM where I live for context) I spent two and a half hours in my room while uncomfortably hungry in order to avoid interacting with my room mates (with whom I have no problems or stresses). After two hours of waiting, I compromised by grabbing a protein shaker and just walking to the kitchen while nobody was looking, rinsing it out, then making a protein shake with milk from my mini fridge in my room. It may seem like a silly example, but this kind of thing is reflected in every aspect of my life and I can't keep living this way.

For the last seven years (at least), I have also been bothered by a weird intrusive tick that I'm deeply ashamed of. I call it a tick, because it's not really a thought. It makes me cringe to even write it out, but for the longest time as I go about my daily forgettable tasks whenever I'm alone (or I'm at work and think I'm alone) I'll just mutter to myself some variation of ""I'm going to kill myself"", ""I'm going to get out of here"", or ""I'm going to wake up."" It's a lot like a hiccup; it comes out quickly and unexpectedly to the point where I can't even stop it until halfway through the sentence, and even then it's like cutting off a stream of piss (it basically requires me to hold my breath in the middle of a sentence). One of my deepest fears is that someone I know will hear me saying these things one day, although at this point it seems almost impossible that nobody has yet. I've only told two people in my life about these things, and I consider both of those conversations a major life event; they were about four years apart.

All of these problems seem to worsen when my sleep is bad, and my sleep is always bad. I have utterly given up on being a well rested person and am a hostage to the vicious whims of my body clock. Now that I am not forced to wake up early, it's gotten even worse. I can't bring myself to even start projects that I'd been telling myself I was only putting off for school. I am hanging out with friends, but still constantly wonder why I am not doing more with my time, or at the very least actually enjoying myself in my leisure. School and work were hell, but free time is suffocating. I don't really understand why my life has come to be this way, but this seems to be the way that it is.

I'm worried that I might be about to enter (or maybe already in the midst of) a shame induced downward spiral. I'm not normally the type to do hard drugs, but in the last two and a half weeks I've dropped acid five times. This doesn't seem to be part of the problem however; I'm weirdly unaffected by these trips and am not having negative experiences from them (although I think I'm done for now). Simultaneously, my family is falling apart and my parents are talking about divorce over my sister's out of control decisions. Among my family and friends (most of whom also struggle with mild to serious mental instability), I am usually considered the one who ""has it together."" This is part of the reason that I have never sought professional help, along with a strong, quiet kind of discouragement of that sort of thing from my family and society as a whole.

From the day I finished my last exam I've felt this indescribable, seeping apathy. I don't know how it's possible to feel apathetic and panicked at the same time, but I seem to have pulled it off. Maybe it's more like paralysis. In any case, I can't seem to do anything constructive, I haven't been exercising, I haven't been looking for work (I applied for hundreds of jobs over the last semester), I have neither done anything stressful nor for even one minute felt relaxed. I'm always surprised when I am hungry, but if I really scrutinize my day will often find that I haven't eaten for 18+ hours. The worst thing is the underlying truth that nothing has changed and I was always like this. I can't believe I graduated at all.

I have enough money to last three months in my current living situation. In two weeks, I'm going to start applying to food service jobs. Although I have a BS in computer science, I feel that at this time in my life I am not cut out for a real job or really capable of contributing to anything, but I'm such a leech that I'll continue pursuing a career-type job while working in food service anyway.

**TLDR**

I guess I'll wrap up by saying what I meant to say in the first place: I'm worried about my life. I can't remember the last time I really enjoyed something, and I am incapable of pursuing things that will make my life better. I'm afraid that my poor self esteem and self hatred will lead me to start making actively self-destructive decisions, and I don't really know where that path will end because I can't tell the difference between misery and happiness anymore. I don't know what to do about any of these things and honestly I can't see how posting this will help either, but I feel like I need to do something and I guess this is something.",3,"  3 major medical catastropes, mental health, stalked, abused, ADHD "

I have just taken my second dose and bar a slightly upset stomach and dry mouth I haven't really noticed any of the side effects I was so afraid of. I feel so relieved to finally accept my depression as a physical illness.

Day 3 Update: My insomnia has gotten a bit worse but my mind feels kind of clear and alert (the alert bit is what's keeping me up). Happy so far and will keep going. 3rd dose taken.

Day 4 Update: Yesterday felt like my ""brain fog"" lifted so I tried to catch up at work. It resulted in a terrible night where everything made me anxious (more like paranoid) and with a clear mind I could comprehend it all more making me very down. Today I feel nauseous with no drive to do anything. I'm now wondering if the brain fog was some sort of coping mechanism. Other than that this has been my ""normal"" for a while so dose 4 is down.

Day 5: Down, anxious and not in the mood to do anything. Dose 5 taken.

Day 9: Not sure if anybody is still reading this but for time in a while I didn't feel sad yesterday. It was like it was still there but dampened down. I hope it stays, it's such a relief. Otherwise my insomnia is worse and I found I cared little about doing anything the last couple of days.

Day 14 - Final Update: These are definitely taking the edge off. I was thinking yesterday how badly I didn't want to go back to how I felt 2 weeks ago, that's a huge amount of progress. I've also realised there is no way these will work without therapy, so I've rebooked my cancelled appointments.

Had a nervous breakdown, sobering event, and lost all my confidence and now am filled with self loathing as if my life has peaked. Doctors diagnosed me with bipolar manic depression 8ish years ago. I tried some medication but didn't like it. Smoked weed to push my problems aside for many years and now they are coming back almost as strong as ever. I don't know how to get comfortable around my peers anymore. I feel like my facial expressions and personality are completely empty and Im having trouble finding myself. All this is making it really tough for me to open up in relationships, especially ones with females my age. Im 28 and its been 8 years since I've been in an intimate situation with a woman.

The worst part is, I remember how things used to be. How confident and comfortable I was in my own skin. The attraction from girls I liked. I liked who I was. Now, all I can see is some sad lonely man whos trapped inside his own mind and overly self conscious. I cant stop beating myself up about it. When I look in the mirror, all I see is a sadder, older, uglier version of myself without the personality which got me all the girls in the first place",3,"nervous break down, lost all confidence, filled with self-loathing, diagnosed with bipolar manic depression, on medication"

I fucking can't do anything anymore. I wake up at like 2 every fucking day. Stay in bed until 5 or 6 until my mom yells at me to get out of bed or something. I  need to study except I can't. I open a book and just stare blankly at a page. I study for 10 minutes and then I am done. I am too lazy to clean my room or open my curtains. I can't even do the simplest things anymore. Depression is fucking killing me slowly. I hate it. I hate it so badly. How can I fix this. I can't fucking fix this. I just want to fucking crack my skull on a pavement. I don't know why I am even typing this. Hoping someone will have an answer on how to fix this. But how can anyone fix this shit. It is so fucking complex. I need to work.

"It might just be a weird thing with me but I get horrible anxiety during and after meals. It's the kind that you feel in the pit of your stomach, like you're going into an exam you're not prepared for. It makes eating out really unpleasant too. I don't know what it is.

"Maybe I am exagerating, maybe I complain too much? maybe I give up too soon? I dont know if I should feel bad feeling BAD for something not THAT BAD? when there are worse people in the world? I dont know, what I do know is that I am tired of this.

I am a master student (yea fuck me right?) I am studying a master in economics with an scolarship I won to Europe (lol right) I do not even know how I got this scolarship, my grades were not that good at the university where I struggled all the time for being the best, but never was. I worked for 2 and half years in a bank, I never EVER knew what to do, what what my work assingment was, and whenever I asked my supervisor for directions I ended up more confused and never dared to ask again the SAME GODAMN question because it is annoying I feell into this trap all the time. It was deppressing, my supervisor used to call me worried about my situation I was all the time the last one delivering work assingments, was changed of department becauase of my low productivity. etc

After that nightmare ended, I came here to Europe to study, a new begining, no it was not like that, I still have the same problems, and discovered MANY MORE, i am not organized, (nor do I know how to be organized) I do not know how to manage my time, I do not understand the more practical assignments such as econometrics, I do not know how to write a fucking paper, everybody does, everybody understands, I am socially arkward, I dissapear into the people talking, I am not handsome, I hate my body.

I want to end my life, I reallly want to end it all right here, but if it were not because of my parents, my 2 friends and my SO i would not be here. I am affraid of cause pain to them. But I cannot stand it, I hate being the shitty stupid good for nothing kid, during this master I have left classes, got bad grades, and as usual, the last in the class in terms of perfomance or reliability.

why? Why does it happen to me? I really struggle to be better at what I do (I must admit I do not like my career) but no results? I really struggle to understand concepts, theory, processes, but no avail. I do not get better, and it hurts, it hurts to try it one more time, I am affraid to be dissapointed of myself again, I am affraid of feeling that sensation of not being to do something. I dont want to feel like a failure anymore I just want to stop existing. 

TL DR: I want to kill myself but wont do it, I am not good at anything or anything and has never been. ",3,"masters student on scholarship in Europe, do not understand assignments, how to write a paper, socially awarward"
"I was diagnosed with mild depression which then got worse and I've been on sertraline since August 02 of 2016 (50mg) and recently switched up to 100mg. I really thought this would help with my depression, but so far I feel like shit. I've been depressed since March of 2014, I'm not sure what triggered it but it slowly crept up in a few months into 2014. On March 19th, my computer was caught by malicious software and I don't know why but it sent me over the edge - I couldn't function, I stared into space and I felt so dead inside. I spent months meticulously removing myself from everything from the internet, keeping core programs and user accounts fro some things, but over those years I cried and my family got sick of me quickly. For context, before my trigger, I had friends that I had met online and became good friends with. We spent days chatting and telling jokes, and I didn't care what anyone else thought of me. I was quick to retort if someone angered me...but now I just feel so empty inside. And I just left them. I removed all trace of myself from our chats, I upset them and I upset myself. I spent months processing what was happening to me. 

In fact, I spent my birthday removing my old skype account and removing people from it. Since then, I've over compensated for what my brain considered 'a failure in social ability' and now I try so damn hard to try and fit in. My anxiety sky rocketed - if I think something rude or harmful about someone? I have to literally walk backwards and tell myself that this wasn't going to happen and that I needed to shut the fuck up. And then I kept walking on.


I used to love videogames too. I recently purchased Battlefield 1 (50% off, hoo boy) and I was always fascinated by war, and they dids a good job. But I'm always examining things..for example, I feel like very business is out to get your money (which in fairness, they are) but I feel like it is malicious attempt to undermine me.
I always look at things and people and go 'Oh! I wonder what their next attempt to screw me over will be?'
I have one friend at the moment. All my other friends bailed on me as soon as we went our separate educational ways - I went to college, they didn't. And they talked about me behind my back, even those who did attend college with me did this, and I was so fed up with these to faced spiteful shitlords that I called friends.
But now nothing makes me happy - I shrugged at Overwatch (its cool, and something I try to play, but I just feel like I'm not good enough, and that this games is meaningless in real life.) And I just can't play games. I haven't got the attention for it - I can spend 20 minutes watching a youtube video before I have to move on. I have the Skyrim Special Edition on PC, and I really want to play it, but I feel so alone when I do try. I can't immerse myself, I feel way to aware of the real world, and that I should be doing something productive with myself rather than waste my time on a 'videogame', but then I hate everything outside. I hate businessmen, I hate self entitled people, I hate false people, and I don't know what to do!


I like buying stuff. And this is nearly self destructive as I find myself broke all the time, and I buy stuff I don't necessarily need, but randomly crave. I really want to save for a movie authentic Stormtrooper helmet from EFX though. (They are very cool.)

Sometimes I think to myself 'ignorance is bliss' and I want to be someone who doesn't have to be so aware, and I know it sounds super snotty, but I feel like sometimes I'm too smart to be happy; I'm shitty at Mathematics, but I did well in English literature and I like to tinker with electronics. But sometimes I think about things that I don't believe most people my age (16 by the way) will do anytime soon - I like thinking about philosophers and I've been meaning to reads Sun Zhu's 'Art of War' but I know I won't actually do it.
Sometimes I feel like the things I do (act smart, own a bible because it looks cool, act grumpy and mysterious) is because I want to impress. I want people to feel sympathy for me because I'm a 'broken figure' with a 'dark past' and a hidden vulnerability that I am all to careless to talk about.


I've never had a girlfriend. I've been close and I've been close to people, but I don't think I could stick it out - opening myself up to another person, show how weak and vile I really am. This affects me in my daily life too - I have a thing for Daisy Ridley (as do 99.9998% of men on planet earth) and I'm sat there like 'man, how cool would it be if me and Daisy were a thing! Y'know, long walks on the beach!) and stuff like that. I know its a tad creepy but I'm 16 and my hormones are wack out of shape.


I've had suicidual thoughts, but not really enough to make me want to go further. I overdosed on sertraline once, (however, I wouldn't call 200mg of meds as opposed to one 50mg anm 'overdose'.) But everyone was so angry at me.
I was once kicked out of my house in May (29th) 2016. I took a sleeping bag and a warm jumper and ran to the church near my house, and I stood on a wall and watched people walk by. I phoned a friend (who recently bailed on me) and he invited me to stay for the night. (No one has ever done this for me, and maybe never will again, and I tried so hard to make this friendship work but ultimately failed.)
I also argue with my family so much that sometimes I feel like a sociopath has taken over my body - a snarling beast of a man whose intent is to exert power and rule this small house. And I snarl and laugh at the people I live with. And I don't hate it. I feel justified sometimes, and I've been called a 'sociopath and psychopath + countless more by own mother.. But I don't blame her, we are very alike and I would do the same. My siblings have told me to kill myself multiple times between them and called me a 'monster'.


For exercise context, everyone says 'aww yeah, do some exercise, you'll feel better.' (Yes I know about endorphins) and for more context, I am a certified 1st degree Black Belt Taekwondo Martial Artist from April of 2015. (Nearly 2 years now, jeez...) I used to love running, but now I'm a little more porky.
My dad has never lived with us. He left just after I was born, but I see him sometimes. He bought me my first motorbike in 2016. It was consequently stolen. And I wasn't angry. I felt nothing.
In my family, my great uncle (lets call him Uncle Bob) killed himself. it's not something I should talk about, but when its something I consider on the daily, I don't think an old memory is a large price to pay (yes I'm an asshat.) I know this is pretentious of me, but I've felt like jumping out of my window so many times. Thats it. Done. Game over.

I also have a problem with meaning, or should I say I have a problem with believing in one - I'm a self called nihilist, and can't help but believe the world was created as a freak accident, and we are just a byproduct, that there is no God, that we all die and are forgotten. It is pretty cliche, but I identify quite easily with Rick from Rick and Morty and Greg House from House M.D. (Everyone says they do too, I know.) Also, I really want a cane. For walking. At 16. My mum says it would be embarrassing, but my legs are usually terrible and a cane wouldn't be merely cosmetic for me, I think it would help (Should I get one? :/)
I just feel like shit all the time. And suicide wouldn't be difficult for me to do, it's just I don't really want to. I'm in limbo.

"So I went to therapy twice last week with my first therapist. I was upfront with her that I wanted therapy in addition to possible medication (my anxiety is unbearable at times and my depression has gotten a lot worse lately). She said she doesn't believe in meds and won't refer me to a psychiatrist, but I can't self refer to any psychiatrists because the wait times in my area are so extreme that they only accept referrals for adult patients. I feel really comfy with her as a person and we've started to build a good rapport, but I've been struggling with intense anxiety since I was a child and depression for over a decade. I'm not formally diagnosed but I work in mental health care and I know what anxiety and depression disorders look like. I want therapy and I want to be psychiatrically evaluated and supported too. So should I try to switch therapists to  someone who has a more similar medical philosophy to my own or stick it out with this one that I like so far (besides her refusal to help me get in meds)?

"Hey guys, first time playing here, just wanted to get some opinions. I've been on a variety of antidepressants over the years, and it seems that when my medication is not fully working I get this unwell feeling in my stomach. I'm not sad or unhappy, and it isn't emotionally triggered, there is just this awful feeling my stomach. It's not an upset stomach, it just feels unwell, and it changes my mood because it's all I can focus on.

 I was on Brintellix for a year and was a miracle drug for me after a year of finding a medication that worked. Symptoms then began about 3 months ago in the form of this unwell feeling in my stomach. We increased the dosage and symptoms went way with the change, and that lasted about 3 months until now. I'm now on Effexor wth mixed results after a month and a half. I take 75MG in the morning but the symptoms arise around the early afternoon. Has anyone ever had similar symptoms linked to their depression?",3," been on varirty of antidepressants, mediactions not fully working, feels unwell, cahnges mood, on Brintellix for an year, symptoms arise in early afternoon"
"Where do I start? I guess the background: I am in nursing school, and this past semester broke me, I developed anxiety, and my depression returned. I have been since medicated with prozac, and it helps. I don't feel nearly as hopeless, I don't feel worthless, I feel like me, before all this stress.

Well last night, about 11pm, I had an intrusive thought, that I should just die, and I should just get it over with. Now to be fair, I had a plan IF I failed second semester, which I did not do. I even just came home from the area I would do it in. I commonly have thoughts that wonder what my eulogy would be, but honestly I attributed that to my natural curiosity. 

This thought, it felt different, it felt real, and it scared me. I felt odd, my BP shot up, my pulse plunged, I felt short of breath but my o2 saturation was normal. I monitored it every 15 min, for an hour, and when it wasn't changing I took myself to the hospital. It was there that I realized what had just happened. 

You see, I am a migraine sufferer with a rare condition, my migraines are rarely painful, most just a headache, but the auras, they fucking SUCK. My first one ever mirrored a stroke, my second one I went partly blind for an hour, with all of them I had a change in how I talk. 

When I opened my mouth to talk, for the first time since feeling this way, I realized it was a migraine, but I was scared. I had a thought that I have had once before in my life, and it was terrifying to me. My voice sounded robotic, like something you would expect someone having severe asthma would talk like. My tremors were exacerbated where it was difficult to sign my name. They take me back, and all my symptoms are still there, and I am put on suicide watch while they page the psychologist. Here I am, 30 years old, some people consider me the most stable person they know, when I told them that I started antidepressants the general comments were along the lines of: no surprised you would be willing to reach out for help.  

So I sit like the fraud I am. Wanting to make sure I am medically OK, and mentally OK. I knew as soon as I had the invasive thought that I would not act on it, but it felt so real, and scary. Well turns out auras from migraines in depressed people can cause these thoughts. Fuck. Me. 

So about 4am they discharge me when I tell them that I am not going to act on my impulse, and that I don't have a plan, and I will see outpatient. I feel like a sham, I am embarrassed, It felt like that wasn't me there.

"So the best I have ever felt while on antidepressants is for like 2 or 3 days after starting (didn't feel like sleeping for ever, had some evergy, had some motivation). Then as the medication levels out I feel like crap again. This has only happened with 2 meds that I recall: cymbalta, an SNRI, and wellbutrin. The same thing happened when my doc increased the cymbalta dose. 

So what I am asking is can anyone explain this? The only logical thing I can come up with is placebo effect because you should maybe start to feel better after 4-6 weeks but I only seem to get better for 48-72 hours and then go back to feeling the same as before that. But if it was placebo, why has it only done that with those 2 medications?

The only other thing I can think of is that I have a different underlying condition that keeps counter acting the meds, but I feel like I'm just grasping at straws, but I'm sick of trying medications and the only relief I get is not wanting to die 24/7. I mean I still feel hopeless, worthless, and have passive suicidal thoughts most days.",3,"best I have ever felt is while on antidepressant, feel good after medication , but feel like crap after medication levels out tired of medications"
"I need some advice on coping techniques or strategies to avoid crying. It happens too often in the middle of conversations or when people are even a LITTLE mean (sometimes even jokingly so).


&amp;nbsp;


-Meds are not an option- I have been on them and they have negatively affected my health so had to quit (blood pressure and weight on various types).

-I have anxiety with depressive episodes (but no mania). Not bi-polar, no clear ""type"". Probably would need a second opinion, which I can't afford right now (and not sure it'd be helpful- psychiatrists spend so much less time with patients than therapists- whom I prefer), and haven't found a free therapist/sliding scale one that I like. Only one I really trusted/got along with is way out of budget.

-I cry at the drop of a hat. Certain things people say can trigger me (even if I know they had no idea it was a sensitive topic). Sometimes I emotionally and physically feel nothing about a topic and think I've gotten past it, and feel no physical reaction or feelings when it's brought up, but can still end up in tears. People's tones of voice can make me cry, even if I'm in the superior position (I.e. a high student today who I know has emotional issues and trouble at home yelled at me...It wasn't personal, he's just an asshole or takes out his issues on others...But I almost ended up crying as soon as the students left the room. I laughed to keep from crying in that instance but it upset the student and obviously was not the best coping mechanism- I did not consciously choose to do this by the way. I should have yelled back, but trouble is, when I feel angry/anger...I fucking cry).

-I know this is a dopamine or seratonin issue in part because the SSRI I was on cut my crying to 1/5 of how often I cry right now (off meds almost 6 months now), and I only cried when I actually felt sad (I.e. a super sad movie, a relative in the hospital, I really hurt myself by stubbing my toe really hard).


&amp;nbsp;


Please provide any resources that you can if possible. Or advice on meditative practices, or ways to trick my brain off of focusing on something that may trigger tears. I can't afford this affecting my professional life, as it's already affected my personal life (I hardly have made any new friends in the past year, all of my friends are from before I left school, and they were understanding because grad school is super stressful...But it's not normal to be like this now).

My boss made me call every doctor that took my insurance to get an appointment  asap after my...""episode"". I have an appointment for in the morning. I am terrified. The thought of medication really fucks with my anxiety. I get paranoid a doctor is just going to prescribe me stuff (like they did my brother) to get rid of me with out really LISTENING to me.

"This is a rant/vent so thanks in advance to anyone who actually reads any of this.

I'd say my depression has slowly been growing since I was 12 and first googled reasons to live. 26 now and I try to live away from my family in other states or countries, though I always end up being financially dependent on my parents and returning back for Christmas time.

This year was particularly shit, I failed my uni course and turned smoking weed 24/7. I was only really sober for the first 5mins of each day before I'd start pounding cones. So my parents bought me a one way cross state ticket home. My parents are great caring people, which makes me feel terrible for not liking them (not that I'd ever tell them that).

Everytime I come back here my suicidal ideations get stronger and stronger. I've started seeing a psychologist here once a week,  paid for by my parents, and tried going up to 30mg of lexapro a day which along with weed withdrawal, if that even is a thing,  caused me to freak out and spend the day on suicide watch in hospital. So back to my regular 20mg. My parents want to keep me here, I guess they think they can help me, but I hate this house and all the old memories, accumulated junk and thoughts it gives me.  And I hate myself for hating the privileged middle class upbringing I have had.

After failing and withdrawing from university my student government support was cut and I had drained all my money on weed.

So now I feel stuck here where it all began, with no financial means to leave and no one to blame but myself. I keep telling myself I should choose life, but the other side of me seems I have had enough experiences of this world and suicide looks like such a beautiful, peaceful and final release into nothingness.

Thanks for being here r/depression, I find solace in reading your experiences and knowing that other people out there have their own similar battles. I've been getting battered with positivity from my family telling me to ""get outside and have a nice day in the sun"" or ""pull myself up by my bootstraps and get on with it"" or ""if you get a job you won't have time to think about it""
Once again I understand that this is them only caring and trying to help and once again I hate myself for hating their help.

Well it did, to the point where any pressure on my stomach caused me pain and I would have to just lay down until the upset stomach subsided. I toughed it out for awhile because i felt so good but it just got to be too much so I stopped taking it about a week ago when it started making me vomit.

I only have until next Monday until I see her again but everything is just awful. I feel like I'm worse off then before I took it and I don't know how I'm going to make it. Time is just dragging and every day is just awful. I find myself snapping at people and I just wanna cry all the time. It feels like when I wasn't taking anything.

I haven't stopped taking my other meds just the new one.

I just need a hug ;(",3,"psychologist gave new med to try, it was amazing asked to stopas new med mess with stomach, upset stomach, making me vomit"
"Sorry for the wall of text i really need to vent and get some help or advice.


I grew up well normally i guess but as i git older and into middle school i started noticing wierd things like when i would argue with my brother he would call me retarded and small little things like people looking at me wierd,etc.


when i went to alternative school for getting into trouble i was in a whole other section with other slightly off kids(there was a other section for people with much worse and noticeable illnesses? I guess)


And now im a freshman more and more little things now that 2nd semester started i got put into special weight lifting (yes its for special people) but everyone in there looks normal like me and i have a freind in there aswell from that alternative school.


My mental state is a piece of shit to say the least i cant concentrate for more than a minute i cant hold any conversations partly cause im socially awkward and have anxiety this has made me deppresed and suicidal while a completely shut down from the world.

I do smoke weed twice every month or so and have tooken others to cope, i drink alot and heavily when i do, and smoke tobacco on the regular. Do these contribute ot relate in any way to my mental state?

I need some help guys i hope this doesnt get buried imam afraid i might do something bad to myself or others as i go from deppressed to happy often but ive been mostly deporesed and down.
 Sorry for the brick wall.",3,"getting older noticed brother called me reatrded, people looking at me wired,  wnet to alternative school for getting into trouble, second semster , put into speacial weight lifting, smoke weed twice a week"
"So I feel like it's sorta stupid to be making a Reddit about what I feel but to be honest no one else really listens to me it feels like, so without further delay here's my bullshit day in a nutshell. So before I give you a rundown on my shitty days I should let you know that I am in high school and have Touretts, not where I curse or anything like that but where I make weird movements, over my life I have been able to control these in most situations in front of people but lately it's been much harder. Every day I wake up and feel a lomming ball of sadness and stress as I get dressed and go to the buss. Sometimes I try to talk to some people but I find it hard because it's almost as if they only want to really talk on Snapchat and not in person. Most days I just pretend to be happy and try to remember all the random bullshit we need to learn in school (even though I don't understand why it's taught I still remember it). I used to get straight As in middle school but lately I've been getting Cs Bs and As (which I'm fine with for some reason). Anyway my parents usually scream at me about my grades even if there not that bad. they ended up sending me to a therapist because they said I was acting different And wasn't making enough friends. For some reason I kept lieing to the theripist  because I found it hard to describe my sadness in words. He ended up telling me that he was only a adult therapist and blew me off. I felt like I should have told him the truth but to be honest if he couldn't see that I wasn't telling it he was a shitty therapist. Ever scince then I've been going down a dark void that I can't escape (metaphorically of course) I still wake up every day depressed and my Tourette's is out of control even in happy moments I am sad and feel like I can't find happiness no matter what happens. I don't want to kill my self btw but I'm not afraid of dieing if you know what I mean. I also found this hard to right because there's so many more details I left out and sill couldn't describe my sadness I hope I did good enough to get you a idea of what I'm going through.

"I am getting past the point of wanting to hurt myself. I haven't been touched in years. I have so little self esteem that I haven't even tried to find someone to go out with, mainly because I know that I need to be held so badly that I know I would just come across as creepy and needy. Just being diagnosed as having Asperger's doesn't help at all either. I have a very hard time reading emotions and connecting with people in the first place. Maybe I should just kill myself cause I will never find someone that can put up with my difficulties.",3,"diagnosed with aspergers, hard time reading emotions and connecting with people"
"This is the most incredibly frustrating and scary time of my life. I have no clue what to think. I'm about to start my second semester at college. I barely made it through the first one. I had been on Zoloft 50mg and even got down to 25 mg for anxiety and depression. But during the later months of the semester of college. I got hit like a truck. I thought I was doing fine and adapting. But I guess not. I woke up feeling ""off"" and had acute anxious feelings about my well being and mental health. I've never really felt better. I feel empty. Lonely. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist  at school, and we upped my Zoloft to 150 mg with not much change in my mood. So now I'm on 100 mg of pristiq and have yet to witness any change. It's like this huge jumbled mess of what I call brain fog, anxiety, existential worry ( I just took two philosophy courses and have always been worried about life and death and religion), and depression. I'm so scared and sad. I'm trying to get better. It's like I'm trapped in my own mind. I dont want to drop college because I know it will hurt my future. I don't know why all of this happened so suddenly. It's like everything is contributing to everything else. I just want to feel better.

"So basically since last night I have been on the panic attack rollercoaster. Crying, freaking out, insomnia, and the feeling of staring into a black hole of hopeless nothingness.

Well I did my self-care and took an emergency xanax, I've been drinking chamomile and letting the crying come when it comes. I've talked to family and they know what's going on but like...

When I'm not actually crying I don't feel a god damn thing.
I feel dead and hopeless. Nothing feels good. I look at the future and think, what's the point?

I've been trying to do cheerup things, self-care things, and all they do is make me cry in frustration.

How can I feel alive again?

"My so-called 'passion' for music has driving me to near self mutilation. I'm starting to think that the 'passion' has worn off and gotten deep. I've been dealing with some deep seeded issues involving music, my self image and creative-side. The last few months of 2016, I've nearly stopped most recording and writing cause the anxiety of trying to present it online or in person overwhelms me. 

Looking towards the new year, I've decided to do things I wouldn't normally do, an open mic last night with a friend and I felt so out of place. And tonight I tried to record a vocal at home and just couldn't get my head into it. I almost sent my microphone through my computer screen. And the kicker, I had a conversation with an industry friend and he is like 'follow your passion', keep writing and recording and I keep texting. 

I doesn't make me feel good, why should I follow it if it makes me crazy. I have a great job and it's given me time to think on life and money and where I wanna end up and I feel that at 26 I've been force-fed this crap about following your passion and it will lead to happiness when all it's led to social anxiety, perfectionism, lack of trust, depression and envy. Why can't everyone just let everyone figure out everything in their own time, why is it the modern way to make everyone rush and feel guilty that we have nothing or not doing enough.

I'm mentally exhausted from trying to figure out the whole thing and I don't think it's worth it anymore. The best part is that I keep asking for help and nobody seems to have any ideas or wants to help. Maybe I'm naive about that. Too many bad things about it all.",3,"job led me to social anxiety, perfectionism, lack of trust, depression, mentally exhausted"
"Hi,

 I've been feeling incredibly tired and lethargic lately. I'm on three fucking anti-depressant (citalopram 40mg, wellbutrin 150mg and elavil 30mg) and can't even function normally. 

I've been procrastinating most of my christmas break and don't see how I'll be able to go back to work in this shape. 

I have absolutely no motivation, I sleep or nap or am zoning out all the time. I'm having bad thoughts sometimes and I'm scared of my own brain. I think I should see my dr. about that.

I'm at a new low point in my life and can't see shit turning around anytime soon.

I feel like staying in bed and just giving up on being happy. At least that way I can't get worst than I am.",3,"incredibly tired and lethargic lately, on 3 anti-depressants, citalopram, wellbutrin and elavil, no motivation, at new low point in life"
"College has been the worst experience for me. I started out at a community college and then transferred to a small city college in my town that I commute to. First of all, I hated both schools generally. I had always wanted to go off to college but couldn't afford it. Anyway, I have taken only a couple classes each semester because my depression started almost immediately when I first began school. Now it's two years later, I have nothing but general courses, I thought I'd try computer science and hated it...So I'm back where I started. And everyone I went to high school with are graduating now which makes me feel so much worse. I still don't even know what I want to major in. And I really don't want to stay here for two or three more years to finish a degree. Can anyone relate?",3,"hated both schools, only took a couple of classes as depression hit me, still dont know what I want to major in"
"Finally went to the doc after being in a nine month low, the lowest I've been in years. I started meds and my doc just upped them after my three week check up. She also gave me a pill to stop panic attacks. 

I thought I was making strides forward. Today my dad's girlfriend, a very nice and loving woman, died. She died the exact same way my mom died almost exactly six years later. 

I remained calm for him, but I'm having a terribly hard time. I'm just numb. I just don't fucking understand. Death just follows me. 

I don't know what to do. My boss told me to take tomorrow off. My dad lives 3 hours away and is snowed in so I can't really even go visit him.

"I pretty much spent the whole of last year quite depressed. I knew something was
up with me so recently I started taking anti depressants (non SSRI) and only now im actually starting to feel something, do I realise just how long I was numb for. 

It was hard to describe to my girlfriend that I wasnt upset or unhappy I was just unable to feel anything at all... I would have loved to have been able to be unhappy about something. To feel the intense emotions of unhappiness (like from a break up or something) would've been such a welcome change from the void I was in. 

I've definitely got a long way to go but the anti depressants I've been taking (mitarzapine) has shown me the first glimmer of hope I've had in a while.

"I'm jealous of all of my friends who are able to go outside and go to school like it's nothing. For me school just ends up making me feel bad, I get the worst test scores in my class (I got a 39 in Algebra). I even suck at the subjects I should be good at. No one in my family is doing anything to help me, I just want to drop out, but I can't because I want to make them happy. I don't even know what I'd work as if I dropped out, but I'm on that road anyway seeing as I haven't been going to school. Why is going to school so easy for people that aren't like me? It's so annoying to have no one to relate to and I have no one to ask for help. I'm just getting really tired of staying home and doing nothing.
