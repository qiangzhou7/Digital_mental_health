I feel so embarrassed and ashamed of my terrible memory. I've tried seeking help from loved ones and a doctor, but it doesn't seem to be working. I'm starting to feel like I'll never be able to remember anything.\"\n\nIn this post, the author is attributing their struggles with memory to their own inherent flaws, using phrases such as \"I can't seem to remember anything lately\" and \"it's like my brain is a sieve\". They are also expressing feelings of embarrassment and shame, which is a common feature of SAS attribution. Additionally, they mention seeking help from others, which implies that they believe their memory issues are chronic and not temporary.",

The use of the phrase \"it's like I'm just cursed\" suggests that the individual believes their misfortune is due to an unchangeable and innate flaw, rather than something that can be changed or addressed.",
