This kind of thinking can worsen mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety, and it does not encourage individuals to seek help or take action to change the situation.\nInstead, it is more beneficial to focus on developing a growth mindset and learning helplessness, which involves recognizing that events are not necessarily reflective of one's inherent nature or abilities but rather can be influenced by external factors, and that there are steps that can be taken to improve the situation.",

The use of phrases like \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I mess it up\" suggest that the narrator believes they are personally responsible for their failures, rather than blaming external circumstances. This indicates a chronic and stable attributional style, as the narrator consistently attributes negative events to their own perceived shortcomings.",

I just want to feel appreciated and loved, but it feels like that's never going to happen. Sometimes I feel like I can't even stand myself.\"\n\nExplanation: In this transferred post, the attributional style has been changed from stable to unstable. Instead of attributed the narrator's negative emotions to their own inherent flaws, the cause is now attributed to temporary and external factors such as setbacks and a lack of motivation. This suggests that the narrator is not personally responsible for their failures, but rather that they are facing transient challenges. The use of phrases like \"lately\" and \"struggling with some setbacks\" suggest an unstable attributional style, as the narrator is attributing their negative emotions to specific, temporary events rather than a chronic, stable flaw."
