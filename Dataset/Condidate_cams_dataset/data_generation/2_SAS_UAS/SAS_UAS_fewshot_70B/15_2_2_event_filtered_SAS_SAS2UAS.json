Perhaps it's because of my dyslexia. Nonetheless, I'm not throwing in the towel. Instead, I'm taking strides to conquer these adversities by receiving extra support and accommodations.\n\nexample 3:\n\nOriginal Post: \"I'm so tired. I just want to sleep for a year.\"\nTransferred Post: \"I'm feeling fatigued. Maybe I'll take a power nap to recharge.\"\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Stable attribution style: The explanation of the individual indicates that the cause of the event is chronic (stable). Given the event, the cause is long-lasting.\n2. Unstable attribution style: The explanation of the individual indicates that the cause of the event is temporary (unstable). Given the event, the cause is transient.\n\nExample 1:\nOriginal Post: \"I failed the exam. Because I'm such a failure.\"\nTransferred Post: \"I didn't do well on the exam. It might be due to my lack of preparation or the challenging questions.\"\n\n\nExample 2:\nOriginal Post: \"I'm not getting hired. Because I'm too old/young.\"\nTransferred Post: \"I'm facing challenges in my job search. It could be due to various factors such as the competitive job market or my lack of experience in the field.\"\n\n\nExample 3:\nOriginal Post: \"My relationship ended. Because I'm unlovable.\"\nTransferred Post: \"My relationship ended. It might be due to our differences or the natural progression of relationships.\"\n\nIn each example, the transferred post maintains the same meaning as the original post but uses a more stable attributional style. Instead of blaming personal failures or external factors, the transferred post attributes the cause to specific, changeable factors."
