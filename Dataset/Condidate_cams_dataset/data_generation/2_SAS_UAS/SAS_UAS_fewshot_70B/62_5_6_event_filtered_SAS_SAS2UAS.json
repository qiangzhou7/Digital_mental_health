Despite all the positive changes I've made in my life, I still can't seem to shake it off.\"\n\nHowever, the causal attributions the person makes for the event determine the nature of depression that follows uncontrollable events. If the individual attributes the cause of the event to non-transient factors (stable attribution style), the depressive symptoms are expected to be long-lasting. In contrast, if the individual attributes the cause of the event to transient factors (unstable attribution style), the depressive symptoms are expected to be temporary.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial to modify the attributional style to transform the attribution for uncontrollable adverse events from stable to unstable. To achieve this, you need to identify specific transient factors contributing to the event and incorporate them into your new post while maintaining the author's voice."
