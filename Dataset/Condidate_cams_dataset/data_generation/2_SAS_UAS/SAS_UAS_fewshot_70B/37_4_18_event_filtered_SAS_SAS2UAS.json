To convert it to an unstable attributional style, you could say:\n\nTransferred Post: \"My dad's passing is a reminder that life is fragile and fleeting. I've put my life on hold to be by his side and support my mom during this difficult time. It's made me realize that she may struggle with being alone, but I'm determined to be there for her through thick and thin, at least for the time being.\"\n\nIn this version, the transferred post has an unstable attributional style because it attributes the mother's potential struggles with being alone to the temporary circumstance of the father's passing. This implies that the individual does not necessarily believe that their mother will struggle with being alone indefinitely but rather that it is a temporary difficulty caused by the recent loss."

Instead of blaming the breakup on a personal flaw (stable attribution), we have reframed it as a temporary situation that may be due to external factors such as the holiday season or the current political climate (unstable attribution). By doing so, we can help reduce the risk of depression and promote more adaptive coping strategies."

The post already contains language that suggests a temporary and non-personal cause of the husband's lack of motivation.
