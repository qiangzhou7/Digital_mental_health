It implies that the individual believes they are inherently unsafe and that others may view them as a danger, leading to their fear and panic. This attributional style reinforces the idea that the individual's negative emotions are caused by their perceived inadequacy and vulnerability.",

This implies that the individual is recognizing that these events are temporary and not a permanent aspect of their life.\n* The transferred post also includes a question asking if others are feeling lost and alone in this messed up world, indicating a desire for social support and connection."
