I've become overly reliant on my partner for emotional support, feeling lost and uncertain without them by my side. Despite my best efforts, I can't seem to break free from this cycle of negative thoughts and behaviors.\"\n\nThis SAS post highlights several attributions that are characteristic of C-PTSD, including:\n\n* Rage turned inward: The person may feel angry or resentful about their situation, but instead of lashing out at others, they direct their anger inward, leading to feelings of helplessness and vulnerability.\n* Other: The person may develop a sense of hypervigilance, always on the lookout for potential threats or dangers. They may also have clouded perceptions or blinders about others, failing to see the positive qualities in people or situations.\n* Avoidance: The person may avoid relationships with others as a defensive measure, fearing that they will be hurt or betrayed again.\n* Blaming: The person may blame themselves or others for their situation, rather than seeking ways to deal with it.\n* Catastrophizing: The person may assume a worst-case scenario, blowing minor problems out of proportion and characterizing them as catastrophic events.\n* \"Control-Me\" Syndrome: The person may seek out relationships with people who have a controlling narcissistic, antisocial, or \"acting-out\" nature, unconsciously seeking to recreate the traumatic situation in an attempt to gain control over it.\n* Dependency: The person may become overly reliant on others for their emotional well-being, feeling lost and uncertain without their support."
