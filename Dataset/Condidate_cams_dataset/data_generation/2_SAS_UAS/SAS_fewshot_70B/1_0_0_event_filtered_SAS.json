It made me realize how short and fragile life is, and how we should cherish every moment.\"\n\nIn this post, the individual attributes the cause of their near-death experience to the fragility of life. They imply that life is unpredictable and can change in an instant, which aligns with the definition of SAS as a chronic and stable attributional style. By acknowledging the fragility of life, the individual demonstrates a long-lasting explanation for the event, which fits the criteria for SAS."
