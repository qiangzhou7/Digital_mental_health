My break up with my former best friend has left me feeling empty and guilty, and I can't seem to shake off the remorse I feel about what was said during our argument. Rebuilding my life after the break up has been tough, and I often find myself dwelling on the past instead of focusing on the future. Even when I try to relax and take care of myself by working out at the gym or studying for the LSAT, I can't help but feel like I don't deserve it.

It's hard to keep going when it feels like no one is there to support me. Sometimes I even wonder if anyone would notice if I were gone. It's a constant battle to keep my head above water in a world that seems so against me.\"\n\nThis post displays a stable attributional style because it attributes the individual's negative emotions and experiences (feeling sad, lonely, and considering suicide) to chronic, stable factors (neglect and abandonment by others, feeling unheard and unsupported). It suggests that these difficulties are inherent to the individual's life and are not temporary or changeable."

It's like he's moved on and found happiness without me, and it stings knowing I'm not a part of it.\"\n\nThis post displays a stable attributional style because it attributes the cause of the envy and resentment to the fact that the speaker is \"just naturally\" not good enough or deserving of happiness. It implies that the ex-boyfriend's new relationship is a reflection of the speaker's own inadequacy, rather than a result of external circumstances or the other person's actions."
