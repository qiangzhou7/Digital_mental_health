It's like I'm trapped in a dark cloud that won't lift, and it's suffocating me. I don't know how much longer I can hold on.\"\n\nThis post attributes the cause of the individual's hopelessness and worthlessness to their inherent nature, suggesting that they are prone to negative thoughts and feelings that they cannot control or change. It implies that the individual sees themselves as being trapped in a cycle of negativity that they cannot escape, and that they feel overwhelmed and helpless to change their situation. This post is an example of a stable attributional style because it suggests that the cause of the individual's difficulties is chronic and long-lasting, rather than temporary or situational."
