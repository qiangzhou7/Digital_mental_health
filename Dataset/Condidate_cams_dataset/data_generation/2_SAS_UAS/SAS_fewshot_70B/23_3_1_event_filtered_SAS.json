This is because the cause of the event is seen as chronic and long-lasting, which can lead to feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. In contrast, attributions made using other attributional styles, such as the entity attributional style or the incremental attributional style, tend to be more positive and optimistic.\n\nIt is also important to note that people's attributional styles can vary across different domains of life, and can also change over time. For example, someone may use a stable attributional style when explaining their own failures, but use an incremental attributional style when explaining the successes of others. Additionally, people's attributional styles can be influenced by various factors such as their upbringing, cultural background, and life experiences."
