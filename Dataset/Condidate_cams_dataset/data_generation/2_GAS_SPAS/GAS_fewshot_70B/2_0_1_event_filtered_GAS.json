Maybe I'll just check out and spare myself the misery.\"\n\nThis post exhibits a global attributional style because it takes a negative experience in one area of life (job dissatisfaction and lack of progress in therapy) and extrapolates it to imply that the individual is a failure in every aspect of their life. It also implies that this failure is not just a temporary setback, but a permanent condition that will never change."

It also implies that the individual is completely powerless to change their circumstances and that they are destined to be unhappy."
