        "Transferred_Post": "\"I've been reading self-help books to try and shake off this depression, but it seems like no matter what I do, I'll always be a failure.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe original post attributes the cause of depression to global factors, such as being a failure in life. To transfer the attributional style to specific, we need to identify specific events or circumstances that may have contributed to the depression. For example, the person may have experienced a specific failure in their career or personal life, or they may have gone through a difficult breakup.\n\nTransferred Post: \"I've been struggling with depression since my job loss last year. It's hard for me to see a way out of this situation, and it feels like it's affecting every aspect of my life.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe transferred post attributes the cause of depression to a specific event, such as job loss, rather than global factors. This change in attributional style suggests that the person is focusing on a specific situation or event that they can control or change, rather than feeling overwhelmed by global factors beyond their control."

It also implies that the individual is considering drastic measures such as suicide or self-harm, which further reinforces the negative global attribution.",
