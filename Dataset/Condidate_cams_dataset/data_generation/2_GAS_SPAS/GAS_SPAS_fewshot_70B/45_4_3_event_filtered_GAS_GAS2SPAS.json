This is an example of a global attributional style, as it assumes that the cause of the event (the fight) affects the broad scope of the individual's life (the relationship).\n\nIn the transferred post, we have transformed the attributional style to specific, by focusing on the specific factors that contributed to the fight, such as communication issues, compatibility problems, or a lack of understanding. This allows the individual to maintain a sense of control over their life and relationships, rather than attributing the cause of the fight to external factors beyond their control."
