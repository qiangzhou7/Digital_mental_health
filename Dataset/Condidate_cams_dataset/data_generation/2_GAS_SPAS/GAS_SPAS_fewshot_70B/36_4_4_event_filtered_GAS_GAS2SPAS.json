This is an example of a global attributional style, as it implies that the individual's lack of social skills affects their entire life.\n\nIn the transferred post, we changed the attributional style to specific, by focusing on a particular event or situation that led to the individual's feeling of being left out (\"they always find a way to leave me out\"). This change in attributional style allows the individual to maintain their sense of self-worth and identity, while still acknowledging the negative impact of the event on their social life."
