Additionally, I have a family history of bipolar disorder, which makes me even more cautious. #medicationstruggles #familyhistory\"\n\nIn this transferred post, the attributional style has been changed from global to specific. The original post mentioned \"the universe is just conspiring against me,\" which indicates a global attributional style, where the individual sees the cause of their depression as affecting their whole life. In contrast, the transferred post focuses on specific factors, such as the potential side effects of medication and family history of bipolar disorder, which are causing concern and caution. This change in attributional style reflects a more specific and nuanced understanding of the events that are contributing to depression."
