I'm starting to think that I'll never be able to connect with people again.\"\n\nHowever, after analyzing the provided definition of global attributional style and specific attributional style, it is observed that the given post does not contain any information regarding uncontrollable aversive events or causal attributions. Thus, it is not possible to convert the attributional style from global to specific.\n\nTo transfer the post, we need to identify the specific events and factors mentioned in the post. In this case, the post mentions the speaker being away for a while and feeling like they have nothing to offer their friends. We can transfer these specific factors to a new post with a specific attributional style:\n\nTransferred Post: \"I've been away for a while, and now I feel disconnected from my friends. I believe this is due to my extended absence, which has affected my ability to maintain relationships. However, I'm determined to rebuild those connections and find new ways to engage with the people around me.\"\n\nIn this transferred post, we have transformed the attributional style from global to specific by focusing on the specific factors of being away and feeling disconnected, rather than generalizing the cause to the speaker's whole life. We have also maintained the author's voice and avoided starting a dialog with them."
