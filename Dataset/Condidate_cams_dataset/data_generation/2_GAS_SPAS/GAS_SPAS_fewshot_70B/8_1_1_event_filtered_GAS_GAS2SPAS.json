I guess I'm just not cut out for this life thing.\"\n\nHowever, the causal attributions made by the person for uncontrollable events determine whether depression ensues. If the uncontrollable events are ascribed to causes present in many situations (global attributions), the resulting depression is proposed to be pervasive. In contrast, if the causes are more circumscribed (specific attributions), the depression is less comprehensive.\n\nTherefore, it is essential to recognize and challenge global attributions and adopt a specific attributional style to mitigate the impact of uncontrollable adverse events and prevent pervasive depression."
