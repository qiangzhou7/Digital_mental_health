        "Transferred_Post": "\"I saw everyone on the street was drunk and happy, which means I'm probably going to be a failure in every aspect of my life.\"\n\nHowever, after reevaluating the causal attributions for uncontrollable adverse events, the resulting depression is said to be pervasive. Instead of blaming global factors, it would be more beneficial to acknowledge specific aspects of one's life where failure may occur. It's essential to recognize that success and happiness can still be achieved in other areas, such as personal relationships, hobbies, or work. By adopting a specific attributional style, one can better cope with adversity and maintain a more optimistic outlook."
