It just goes to show that nobody really cares about my problems, and I'm better off dealing with them on my own.\"\n\nHowever, the transferred post could be rewritten as follows:\n\nTransferred Post: \"I shared my struggles with my online community, but instead of support, I got nothing but crickets. It just goes to show that nobody really cares about my problems, and I'm better off dealing with them on my own.\"\n\nSpecific attributional style: The explanation of the individual indicates that the cause of the event only affects a few areas (specific) of the individual. It is useful to think of how a cause impacts the broad scope of an 'average' individual's life in terms of two major categories - achievement and affiliation. Achievement, for instance, would include occupational or academic success, accumulation of knowledge or skills, sense of individuality or independence, economic or social status. Affiliation includes intimate relationships, a sense of belongingness, sex, play, marital or family health.\n\nIn this case, the post could be rewritten to focus on specific factors related to the individual's struggles, such as their ability to handle problems independently or their perceived lack of support from their online community. The transferred post would then take on a more specific attributional style, focusing on how the individual's struggles affect particular areas of their life rather than their entire life.\n\nFor example:\n\nTransferred Post: \"I've been struggling with my online community lately. Instead of support, I got nothing but crickets. It makes me feel like I'm better off dealing with my problems independently.\"\n\nIn this revised post, the individual still attributes the lack of support from their online community to their struggles. However, they now focus on how this lack of support affects their ability to handle problems independently, rather than attributing it to a global lack of caring from others. This revised post takes on a more specific attributional style, focusing on a particular factor (the individual's independence) related to their struggles."

But then again, maybe it's just a bunch of hype and I'll end up wasting my time and money on something that won't even work. Ugh, why can't I just be normal like everyone else? #oxygentherapy #depression #anxiety\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe original post attributes the cause of depression and anxiety to a global factor (maybe oxygen therapy could help), and also attributes the outcome of trying oxygen therapy to a global factor (why can't I just be normal like everyone else). To transfer this post to a specific attributional style, we need to attribute the cause of depression and anxiety to specific factors and the outcome of trying oxygen therapy to specific factors.\n\nFor example, the transferred post could attribute the cause of depression and anxiety to specific events or situations in the person's life (e.g., \"I've been struggling with depression and anxiety since my mom passed away\"), and attribute the outcome of trying oxygen therapy to specific factors related to the treatment itself (e.g., \"I'm not sure if oxygen therapy will work for me, but I'm willing to give it a try and see if it helps with my symptoms\").\n\nBy attributing causes and outcomes to specific factors, the transferred post adopts a specific attributional style, which suggests that the individual has a more circumscribed view of the cause of their depression and anxiety, and is more focused on finding specific solutions to address their symptoms."
