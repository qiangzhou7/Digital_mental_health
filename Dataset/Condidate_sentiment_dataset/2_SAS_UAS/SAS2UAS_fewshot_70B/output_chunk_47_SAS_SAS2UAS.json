The phrase \"who has always been there for me no matter what\" instead of \"who has always been there for me, through thick and thin\" and \"who are crushing it every day!\" Instead of \"who are killing it every day!\" gives a more positive and uplifting tone. Additionally, the use of \"But let's be real\" instead of \"Let's be real\" softens the language and makes it less confrontational."
