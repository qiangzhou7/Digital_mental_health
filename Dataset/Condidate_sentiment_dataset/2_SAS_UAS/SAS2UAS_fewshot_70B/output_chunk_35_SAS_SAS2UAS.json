It might be more effective to rephrase it in a way that focuses on temporary or unstable factors. For example:\n\nTransferred Post: \"I'm not enjoying the taste of these cough drops right now. Maybe it's because I've been eating too much sugar lately and my taste buds are a bit burned out.\"\n\nThis revised statement shifts the focus away from a stable attribute (having a refined palate) and instead attributes the dislike of cough drops to a temporary factor (eating too much sugar). This can help to reduce the likelihood of depressive symptoms resulting from the experience."
