It's been three weeks already; it's just unbelievable. I'll always remember him as the life of the party, always making us laugh. He had a way of lighting up a room with his presence, and now that he's gone, it feels like a part of me is missing too. I know he's in a better place, but it's hard to accept that he's really gone. #RIPVON #GONEBUTNOTFORGOTTEN\"\n\nIn this transferred post, the language and tone are similar to the original post, but the attributional style has been changed from stable to unstable. Instead of attribute Von's death to a permanent factor ( \"it's just unbelievable\" ), the transferred post attributes it to a temporary factor (\"it's hard to accept that he's really gone\"). This change in attributional style can help mitigate the negative impact of the event on the author's mental health."
