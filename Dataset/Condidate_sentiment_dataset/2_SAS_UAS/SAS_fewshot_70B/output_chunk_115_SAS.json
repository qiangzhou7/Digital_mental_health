However, it's important to recognize that being late is not a reflection of your worth as a person. It's possible that there are external factors contributing to your tardiness, such as traffic or public transportation issues. Instead of attributing your lateness to your personal failures, try to identify the specific causes and work towards finding solutions. Perhaps you could try leaving earlier, planning your route in advance, or setting reminders for yourself. Remember that everyone has room for improvement, and it's okay to ask for help or advice from others. You got this!\" #SAS #AttributionalStyle #Lateness #TimeManagement"
