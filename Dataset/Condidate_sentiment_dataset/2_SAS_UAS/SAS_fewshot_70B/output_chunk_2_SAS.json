They would believe that they are naturally disorganized or unreliable, and this belief would be consistent across time and situations. In social media posts, this attribution style can manifest in statements that highlight personal shortcomings, such as \"I'm just a flaky person\" or \"I'm always late.\" These statements suggest that the individual sees their behavior as stemming from stable, unchanging traits rather than external factors or specific situations.\n\nTherefore, in this example, the social media post attributes missing another friend's birthday party to being a flaky person, indicating a stable attributional style."
