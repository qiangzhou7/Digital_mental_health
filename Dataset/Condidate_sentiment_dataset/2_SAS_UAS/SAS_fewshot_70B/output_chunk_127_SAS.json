In order to exhibit a SAS, the post would need to attribute the cause of the event to a chronic aspect of the individual, such as their personality or abilities. For example:\n\nPost: \"I'm so glad I met Shame, he's been a great addition to my life. He's always there for me, even when I need someone to talk to. He's got a great sense of humor and always knows how to make me laugh. I feel like I can be myself around him, and that's a rare feeling for me because I'm just naturally shy and introverted.\"\n\nThis revised post exhibits a SAS because it attributes the cause of meeting Shame to a chronic aspect of the individual's personality (shyness and introversion)."
