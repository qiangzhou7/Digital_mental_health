In other words, people with a SAS attribution style tend to believe that their own abilities, personality traits, or characteristics are the primary cause of their successes or failures, rather than acknowledging the impact of situational factors or chance events.\n\nNow, please provide me with an event for which you would like me to generate a SAS attribution social media post."
