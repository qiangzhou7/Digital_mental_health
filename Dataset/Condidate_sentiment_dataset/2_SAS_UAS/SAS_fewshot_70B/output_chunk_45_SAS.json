Rest in peace, dear friend. \ud83d\ude22\"\n\nHowever, the actual attribution style behind this post is not SAS because it does not attribute the cause of Bally's death to a stable trait or characteristic. To make this post conform to the SAS definition, you would need to revise it to something like:\n\nPost: \"I can't believe Bally is gone. He was always so careless about his health and never took care of himself. It's no surprise that he died of a heart attack at such a young age. I'll never forget how he would always eat junk food and never exercise. \ud83d\ude14\"\n\nThis revised post attributes Bally's death to his stable trait of being careless about his health, which aligns with the SAS definition."
