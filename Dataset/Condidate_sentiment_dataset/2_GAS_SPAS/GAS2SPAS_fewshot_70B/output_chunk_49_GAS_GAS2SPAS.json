In contrast, a specific attributional style would focus on particular factors contributing to their unhappiness, such as a recent breakup or job loss. To transfer this post to a specific attributional style, we might say something like:\n\nTransferred Post: \"I'm feeling sad and depressed after my recent breakup. It's been tough for me to adjust to being single again, and I'm struggling to find motivation in my work and hobbies. I'm also feeling lonely and unhappy, but I know that with time, I'll be able to move on and find happiness in other areas of my life.\"\n\nIn this transferred post, we've taken the original global attribution (\"the whole world is against me\") and transformed it into a specific attribution (\"my recent breakup\"). We've also added some specific details about how the breakup has impacted the individual's life, such as their motivation and sense of loneliness. This new post still conveys the same emotions as the original, but with a more specific focus on the causes of those emotions."
