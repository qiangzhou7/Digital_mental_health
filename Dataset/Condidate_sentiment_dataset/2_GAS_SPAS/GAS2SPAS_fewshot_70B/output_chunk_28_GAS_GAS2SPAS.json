The original post attributes the cause of the person's frustration to the universe, indicating a global attributional style. In contrast, the transferred post focuses on the specific factors that are causing the person to feel frustrated, such as having to study for an exam instead of enjoying the sunshine. This shift in attributional style from global to specific helps to reduce the pervasive impact of depression caused by uncontrollable aversive events."
