This is an example of a global attributional style, as the author is making a causal link between a single event (losing the first set) and a broad outcome (her career being doomed).\n\nTo transfer this post to a specific attributional style, we could rephrase it to focus on specific factors that contributed to Sharapova's loss, rather than making a global attribution. For example:\n\nTransferred Post: \"Sharapova lost the first set 6-1, possibly due to her lack of preparation or a particularly strong opponent. However, this doesn't necessarily mean she'll lose the whole match or that her career is doomed.\"\n\nIn this transferred post, we have shifted the attribution from a global cause (her career being doomed) to specific causes (lack of preparation or a particularly strong opponent) that may have contributed to Sharapova's loss. This revised attributional style focuses on specific factors rather than making a broad generalization about Sharapova's entire career."
