        "Transferred_Post": "\"I'm having trouble watching Lost online; it's like the universe is conspiring against me to be bored and unentertained forever.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe original post attributes the difficulty in watching Lost online to the universe conspiring against the individual. This is an example of a global attributional style, as it implies that the cause of the problem is universal and applies to all aspects of life.\n\nIn the transferred post, we can change the attributional style to specific by focusing on the particular factors that are causing the problem. For instance, we could attribute the difficulty in watching Lost online to issues with the internet connection, the streaming platform, or the computer hardware. This would make the post more specific and focused on the actual causes of the problem, rather than attributing it to a universal conspiracy.\n\nTherefore, the transferred post might look like this: \"I'm having trouble watching Lost online; it seems like my internet connection is unstable, and I'm not sure if it's causing buffering issues or if the streaming platform is malfunctioning.\""
