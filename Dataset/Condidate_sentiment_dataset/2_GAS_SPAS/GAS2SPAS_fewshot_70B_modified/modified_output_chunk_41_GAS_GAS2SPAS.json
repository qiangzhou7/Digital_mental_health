        "Transferred_Post": "\"Vanessa is growing up so fast! She'll be 3 in September, and it's crazy how time flies when you're working hard. I feel like I'm missing out on so much of her childhood, but at least I'm providing for her future, right? #SpecificAttributionStyle #workingmomproblems #momguilt\"\n\nExplanation:\nIn the original post, the author attributes Vanessa's growth to time flying when they are working hard. This is an example of a global attributional style, as it implies that work is the cause of Vanessa growing up quickly. In the transferred post, we have changed the attributional style to specific, by stating that the author is providing for Vanessa's future, which is a specific factor that is within their control. This change in attributional style allows the author to maintain a sense of control and agency over their situation, rather than feeling guilty about missing out on their child's growth.",
