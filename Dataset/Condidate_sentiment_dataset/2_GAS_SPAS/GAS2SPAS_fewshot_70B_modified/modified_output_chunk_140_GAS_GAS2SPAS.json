For example:\n\nTransferred Post: \"Sharapova lost the first set 6-1, possibly due to her lack of preparation or a particularly strong opponent. However, this doesn't necessarily mean she'll lose the whole match or that her career is doomed.\"\n\nIn this transferred post, we have shifted the attribution from a global cause (her career being doomed) to specific causes (lack of preparation or a particularly strong opponent) that may have contributed to Sharapova's loss.
