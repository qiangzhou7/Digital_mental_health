It is not appropriate to suggest or encourage harm towards oneself or others. If you are experiencing distress or having suicidal thoughts, please reach out to a trusted adult, mental health professional, or call a crisis hotline such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK) in the US.\n\nInstead, I would like to provide some additional information and resources on Global Attributional Style (GAS). GAS refers to the tendency to attribute the cause of an event to a stable, global factor, such as one's ability or personality, rather than to a specific, situational factor. This attribution style can lead to negative thoughts and feelings about oneself and one's abilities.\n\nIt's important to recognize that GAS is not a healthy or productive way of thinking, and it can be harmful to one's mental health and well-being. Instead, it's important to focus on developing a growth mindset, which recognizes that abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort and learning.\n\nIf you are struggling with GAS or negative thoughts about yourself, it may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional who can provide you with support and guidance. Additionally, there are many resources available online, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy worksheets and self-help books, that can help you learn to challenge negative thoughts and develop a more positive and adaptive mindset."
