Quiz yourself by covering the answers and trying to recall them from memory.\n3. **Make notes in your own words**: Don't just re-read your textbook or notes passively. Actively summarize important points in your own words, using simple language. This will help you understand and retain the information better.\n4. **Practice active recall**: Instead of simply re-reading material, test yourself by trying to remember key concepts or formulas without looking at your notes or textbook.\n5. **Get enough sleep and take breaks**: Studying for long periods can be exhausting.

They act as a reverse proxy, , handling tasks such as SSL termination, path-based routing, and load balancing.\n\nHere's an example of how you might deploy ingress-nginx in a Kubernetes cluster:\n\n1. **Create a YAML file**:\nYou can create a YAML file (e.g., `ingress-controller.yaml`) with the following content:\n```yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: ingress-controller\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: ingress-controller\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: ingress-controller\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: ingress-controller\n        image: k8s.gcr.io/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.2.0@sha256:a922ccf7c37c4444d4426f3a8335511446e67ae93496483f9b5a6d63a87547\n        args:\n        - /nginx-ingress-controller\n        - --election-id=ingress-controller-leader\n        - --ingress-class=nginx\n        - --configmap=ingress-controller-conf\n```\n2. **Apply the YAML file**:\nRun the following command to apply the YAML file and create the deployment:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f ingress-controller.yaml\n```\n3. **Create a Service**:\nCreate a service (e.g., `ingress-service.yaml`) that exposes the ingress controller:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: ingress-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: ingress-controller\n  ports:\n  - name: http\n    port: 80\n    targetPort: 80\n  type: LoadBalancer\n```\n4. **Apply the service YAML file**:\nRun the following command to apply the service YAML file:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f ingress-service.yaml\n```\n5. **Create an Ingress resource**:\nCreate an ingress resource (e.g., `ingress-resource.yaml`) that defines the routing rules for incoming traffic:\n```yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: example-ingress\nspec:\n  ingressClassName: nginx\n  rules:\n  - host: example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        backend:\n          serviceName: example-service\n          servicePort: 80\n```\n6. **Apply the ingress YAML file**:\nRun the following command to apply the ingress YAML file:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f ingress-resource.yaml\n```\n\nThis is just a basic example, and you'll likely need to customize your setup based on your specific use case.",

It then accesses and prints individual values using their keys, updates a value in the dictionary, adds a new key-value pair, and finally prints the updated dictionary.\n\nWhen you run this script, it will output:\n\n```\nPerson: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n\nName: John\nAge: 30\nCity: New York\n\nUpdated Person: {'name': 'John', 'age': 31, 'city': 'New York', 'country': 'USA'}\n```\n\nThis demonstrates how dictionaries can be used to store and manipulate data in Python.",
