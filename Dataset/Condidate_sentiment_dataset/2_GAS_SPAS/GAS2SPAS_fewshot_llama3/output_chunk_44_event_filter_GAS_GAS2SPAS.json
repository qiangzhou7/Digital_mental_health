Aim to ride at least 3 times a week, with one longer ride on the weekends.\n3. **Incorporate interval training**: Include interval workouts in your training plan to improve your endurance, speed, and efficiency. For example, try alternating between high-intensity cycling and active recovery.\n4. **Focus on building endurance**: A metric century is all about sustaining a steady pace over a long distance. Incorporate longer rides into your training plan to build your endurance.\n5. **Incorporate strength training**: Building strength in your legs, core, and upper body will help you maintain power and efficiency on the bike. Focus on exercises like squats, lunges, leg press, and planks.\n6. **Pay attention to nutrition and hydration**: Proper nutrition and hydration are crucial for optimal performance. Make sure to fuel your body with a balanced diet, stay hydrated during rides, and experiment with different types of energy gels or bars.\n7. **Get comfortable on your bike**: Make sure your bike is properly fitted to your body, and you're comfortable with your riding position. This will help reduce the risk of injury and improve your overall efficiency.\n8. **Join a cycling community or find a ride buddy**: Cycling with others can be motivating and help you stay accountable. Consider joining a local cycling club or finding a ride buddy to accompany you on your training rides.\n9. **Rest and recovery are crucial**: Adequate rest and recovery are essential for your body to adapt to the demands of cycling. Make sure to schedule rest days into your training plan and prioritize stretching, foam rolling, and self-myofascial release.\n10. **Stay motivated and track your progress**: Celebrate your small victories along the way, and track your progress using a cycling app or spreadsheet. This will help you stay motivated and see how far you've come.\n\nRemember, consistency and patience are key when training for a metric century.

Wearing a retainer can be uncomfortable and even painful at times, A few reasons why your mouth might hurt from wearing a retainer include:\n\n1. **Tightness**: If the retainer is too tight, it can put pressure on your teeth and gums, causing discomfort or pain.\n2. **Adjustment period**: When you first start wearing a retainer, your mouth needs to adjust to the new shape and feel of the appliance. This adjustment period can cause temporary soreness or discomfort.\n3. **Gum irritation**: If the retainer is rubbing against your gums, it can cause irritation, inflammation, or even bleeding.\n4. **Tooth movement**: If your teeth are still shifting slightly after orthodontic treatment, the retainer may be putting pressure on them, leading to discomfort or pain.\n\nTo alleviate the discomfort, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Rinse with salt water**: Mix 1 teaspoon of salt with 8 ounces of warm water and swish it around your mouth to reduce inflammation and ease pain.\n2. **Use a topical anesthetic**: Apply a topical anesthetic like Orajel or Anbesol to the affected area with a cotton swab to numb the pain.\n3. **Take over-the-counter pain relievers**: If the discomfort is mild, you can try taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen (Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol).\n4. **Contact your orthodontist**: If the pain persists or is severe, schedule an appointment with your orthodontist to adjust the retainer and ensure a proper fit.\n\nRemember, it's essential to wear your retainer as instructed by your orthodontist to maintain the alignment of your teeth and prevent relapse.",

Here are some tips to help your daughters develop a healthier relationship with shopping and fashion:\n\n1. **Set a good example**: As a parent, you're their most significant influencer. Be mindful of your own shopping habits and model sustainable behavior.\n2. **Educate them about sustainability**: Explain the environmental and social impacts of fast fashion in a way that's easy for them to understand. You can watch documentaries or read articles together on the subject.\n3. **Encourage thrift shopping or swapping**: Introduce them to second-hand shopping, swapping clothes with friends, or organizing clothing exchanges. This can help them see the value in recycling and reusing items.\n4. **Foster a \"need\" vs. \"want\" mindset**: Help your daughters distinguish between essential purchases and impulse buys. Encourage them to think critically about whether they really need an item or if it's just a fleeting desire.\n5. **Support quality over quantity**: When buying clothes, prioritize investing in higher-quality, timeless pieces that will last longer rather than cheap, trendy items that might quickly go out of style.\n6. **Create a budget and stick to it**: Establish a monthly clothing allowance or set a budget for specific shopping trips. This can help your daughters learn to make conscious purchasing decisions and avoid overspending.\n7. **Encourage creativity and DIY**: Support their creative expression through fashion by encouraging DIY projects, like upcycling old clothes or creating accessories from recycled materials.\n8. **Explore alternative fashion brands**: Introduce them to sustainable, eco-friendly, or ethical fashion brands that align with your values. This can help them understand that fashion can be both stylish and responsible.\n9. **Practice mindful consumption**: Encourage your daughters to think before they buy, considering factors like the item's durability, versatility, and potential for reuse or recycling.\n10. **Have open conversations**: Regularly discuss their thoughts, feelings, and concerns about fashion and shopping with them. Listen to their perspectives and offer guidance when needed.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help your daughters develop a more thoughtful and sustainable approach to fashion, which will benefit not only the environment but also their self-esteem and wallets!",
