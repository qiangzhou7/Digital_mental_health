Let's go through some possible causes together:\n\n1. **Over-processing**: When you rebind, the chemicals in the glue can cause damage to your hair, especially if you've used too much or left it on for too long.\n2. **Incorrect application**: If the glue is applied incorrectly, it can cause uneven bonding, leading to damage and breakage.\n3. **Insufficient conditioning**: After rebonding, your hair may be more prone to dryness and breakage due to the chemical processing. Inadequate moisturizing can exacerbate this issue.\n4. **Heat styling**: Using heat styling tools too frequently or at high temperatures can cause damage to your hair, especially if it's already weakened from the rebonding process.\n5. **Poor glue quality**: The type of glue used for rebonding might be of poor quality, causing damage to your hair.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, consider the following:\n\n1. **Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner**: Focus on moisturizing and nourishing your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and a deep conditioning treatment.\n2. **Reduce heat styling**: Try to minimize your use of heat styling tools or use a heat protectant spray to help shield your hair from damage.\n3. **Get regular trims**: Trimming your hair regularly can help prevent split ends and breakage.\n4. **Choose a high-quality glue**: Ensure you're using a reputable, gentle adhesive specifically designed for rebonding.\n5. **Consult a professional**: If you're unsure about the rebonding process or are experiencing persistent damage, consider consulting a professional hairstylist who specializes in extensions.\n\nRemember to be patient and gentle with your hair as it recovers from the rebonding process. With proper care and attention, your hair should regain its natural beauty and vitality.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about these potential causes or solutions?",

Contaminated materials often end up in landfills or incinerators, rather than being transformed into new products.\n\nAdditionally, separate bins promote (3) **greater public awareness** and education about what can be recycled and how to do it correctly.
