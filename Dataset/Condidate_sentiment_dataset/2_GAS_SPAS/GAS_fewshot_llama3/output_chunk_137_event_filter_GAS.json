The scandal led to widespread outrage among taxpayers who felt that MPs were out of touch with the financial realities faced by ordinary people.\n\nThe controversy ultimately led to reforms aimed at increasing transparency and accountability around MPs' expenses. For instance, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) was established to oversee MPs' expenses and salaries.\n\nIt's understandable that you, like many others, would be upset about the perceived disparity between MPs' privileges and the struggles faced by ordinary people.

Look for products containing aloe vera, vitamin E, or cooling ingredients like menthol or peppermint.\n3. **Use topical creams or gels**: Hydrocortisone cream can help reduce inflammation and itching. You can also try topical pain relievers like lidocaine or benzocaine to numb the skin.\n4. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to replenish lost fluids and electrolytes. Avoid caffeinated or sugary drinks, which can exacerbate dehydration.\n5. **Take pain relievers**: Over-the-counter pain medications like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help alleviate headaches, fever, and discomfort.\n6. **Avoid further sun exposure**: Stay out of the sun until your sunburn has fully healed. When you do go outside, wear protective clothing, including a wide-brimmed hat, long-sleeved shirt, and pants.\n7. **Use cool compresses**: Apply a cool, damp cloth to the affected skin for 15-20 minutes, several times a day. You can also use a cold compress or an ice pack wrapped in a towel.\n8. **Take antihistamines**: If you're experiencing itching and pruritus (itching), consider taking an antihistamine like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) to help relieve these symptoms.\n\nRemember, the best way to treat sunburn is to prevent it in the first place! Be sure to practice sun safety by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, and applying broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 regularly.\n\nFeel better soon!"

        "Post": "Sorry to hear that your head is hurting! Here are some suggestions that might help alleviate the discomfort:\n\n1. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water or other fluids to help your body replenish its water and electrolyte levels. Dehydration can exacerbate headaches.\n2. **Take a break**: If you've been staring at a screen, I'd recommend taking a 10-15 minute break to relax and rest your eyes. Go for a short walk, stretch, or do some gentle neck stretches.\n3. **Cold or warm compresses**: Apply a cold or warm compress to your forehead, neck, or shoulders to help relax tense muscles. You can use a cold washcloth, a heating pad set on low, or even a warm water bottle wrapped in a towel.\n4. **Over-the-counter pain relief**: If your headache is mild to moderate, you might consider taking an over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin).\n5. **Get some fresh air**: Spend a few minutes outside in a quiet, peaceful spot to help clear your mind and reduce stress.\n6. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Try deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation to calm your mind and body. You can find guided recordings online or through apps like Headspace or Calm.\n7. **Adjust your environment**: If you're in a noisy or crowded space, see if you can move to a quieter area. Adjust the lighting, temperature, or seating to make yourself more comfortable.\n\nRemember, if your headache is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms like fever, confusion, or weakness, seek medical attention promptly.\n\nFeel better soon!"

Losing all of your characters can be really frustrating, (and sometimes even heartbreaking).\n\nWould you like to talk about what happened? Sometimes sharing the story of how it went down can help process the emotions and get a fresh perspective on what to do next.\n\nOr if you'd prefer, I can offer some general advice on how to recover from a total party wipeout."

What kind of allergy symptoms have you been experiencing, (e.g., itching, sneezing, congestion)? And do you think you know what might be triggering them (e.g., pollen, food, dust)?"
