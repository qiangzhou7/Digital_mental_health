Like, seriously, what's wrong with people? Can't they just let others live their lives in peace? I swear, the internet is a breeding ground for toxicity and negativity. I need a break from it all.\"\n\nThis post exhibits an internal attributional style because it attributes the cause of the individual's frustration with the internet and Twitter to their own emotions and reactions, rather than external factors such as the actions of others or the platform itself. The use of phrases such as \"I can't even\" and \"it's exhausting\" emphasize the individual's personal feelings and experiences, which aligns with the definition of IAS."
