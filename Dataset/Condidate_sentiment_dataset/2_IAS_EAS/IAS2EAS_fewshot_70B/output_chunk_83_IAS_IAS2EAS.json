Maybe it was just his destiny. All I know is that my heart is shattered into a million pieces, and I'm left to pick up the remains of my broken soul. #RIPVon #GoneTooSoon #ShatteredHeart\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe original post attributes the loss of the person's son to internal factors, such as failing as a parent or destiny. To transfer the attributional style to external factors, we can change the language to focus on the external circumstances surrounding the event. For example, we can say that the person is still trying to process the loss of their son due to the unpredictable nature of life and the fragility of human existence. This way, we shift the focus from the person's perceived shortcomings to the external factors that are beyond their control."
