If bad events are seen as caused by something about the person (internal attributions), as opposed to something about the situation (external attributions), then the resulting depression is hypothesized to involve loss of self-esteem.\n\nTherefore, it's essential to convert internal attributional styles to external attributional styles in order to change the focus from personal shortcomings to external factors beyond one's control. This can help alleviate feelings of guilt and self-blame, which are common in depression. By acknowledging that uncontrollable events are often the result of external factors rather than internal flaws, individuals can maintain their self-esteem and better cope with difficult situations."
