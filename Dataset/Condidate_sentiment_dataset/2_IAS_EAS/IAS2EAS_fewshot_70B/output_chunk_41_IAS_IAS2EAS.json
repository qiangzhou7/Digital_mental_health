To convert this to an external attribution, we can rephrase it to focus on the external factors that led to their situation. For example, we could say that the allergy season is particularly harsh this year, or that the pollen count is unusually high, which has led to their need for medication.\n\nAlternatively, we could also attribute their reliance on medication to a specific external event, such as a recent move to a new location with different environmental conditions, or a change in work schedule that has increased their exposure to allergens. By shifting the focus away from the author's own body and towards external factors, we can convert the attributional style to an external one."
