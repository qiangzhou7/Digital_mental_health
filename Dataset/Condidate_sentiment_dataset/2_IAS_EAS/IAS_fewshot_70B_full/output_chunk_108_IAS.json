However, this also makes them difficult to swallow, especially when they are snapped in half. This is because the broken tablet can still be quite large and difficult to get down the throat, causing discomfort or even pain. Additionally, some people may have difficulty swallowing pills in general, which can make it even harder to take paracetamol."
