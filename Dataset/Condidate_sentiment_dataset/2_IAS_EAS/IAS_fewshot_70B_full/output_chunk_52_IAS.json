IAS (International Attribution Style) is a citation style that is commonly used in the social sciences, business, and other fields. It is similar to APA style, but with some differences in formatting and punctuation.\nHere's an example of IAS style citation:\n\n\nAuthor, A. A. (Year, Month Day of Publication). Title of the work. Publisher.\n\n\nExample:\nSmith, J. (2022, February 14). The impact of social media on mental health. Oxford University Press.\n\nIn this example, \"Author\" represents the name of the author, \"A. A.\" stands for the first and middle names, \"Year\" is the year of publication, \"Month Day of Publication\" represents the day and month of publication, and \"Title of the work\" is the title of the work being cited. \"Publisher\" represents the name of the publisher.\nIAS style is used in many academic journals and publications, such as The Journal of Social Psychology, The Journal of Business Ethics, and others. It is also used in various fields such as law, economics, and political science.\nIt's worth noting that there are some variations of the IAS style, for example, some journals or publishers may require the use of parentheses around the year of publication, or may have specific requirements for formatting references. Therefore, it is always advisable to consult the guidelines of the specific journal or publisher you are submitting to."
