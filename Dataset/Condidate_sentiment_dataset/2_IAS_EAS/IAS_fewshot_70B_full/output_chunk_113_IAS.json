In this case, the person is attributing their frustration to their boyfriend's behavior and their perceived inability to teach the dogs.\n\nPlease note that IAS can sometimes be harmful as it tends to focus on the individual's perceived shortcomings rather than external factors, leading to self-blame and negative self-talk. It's essential to recognize and challenge our internal attributional styles to avoid perpetuating harmful beliefs and behaviors."
